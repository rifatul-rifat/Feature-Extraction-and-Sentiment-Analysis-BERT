"I had such high hopes for this dress and really wanted it to work for me. i initially ordered the petite small (my usual size) but i found this to be outrageously small. so small in fact that i could not zip it up! i reordered it in petite medium, which was just ok. overall, the top half was comfortable and fit nicely, but the bottom half had a very tight under layer and several somewhat cheap (net) over layers. imo, a major design flaw was the net over layer sewn directly into the zipper - it c",0
"I love tracy reese dresses, but this one is not for the very petite. i am just under 5 feet tall and usually wear a 0p in this brand. this dress was very pretty out of the package but its a lot of dress. the skirt is long and very full so it overwhelmed my small frame. not a stranger to alterations, shortening and narrowing the skirt would take away from the embellishment of the garment. i love the color and the idea of the style but it just did not work on me. i returned this dress.",0
Dress runs small esp where the zipper area runs. i ordered the sp which typically fits me and it was very tight! the material on the top looks and feels very cheap that even just pulling on it will cause it to rip the fabric. pretty disappointed as it was going to be my christmas dress this year! needless to say it will be going back.,0
This dress is perfection! so pretty and flattering.,1
"More and more i find myself reliant on the reviews written by savvy shoppers before me and for the most past, they are right on in their estimation of the product. in the case of this dress-if it had not been for the reveiws-i doubt i would have even tried this. the dress is beautifully made, lined and reminiscent of the old retailer quality. it is lined in the solid periwinkle-colored fabric that matches the outer fabric print. tts and very form-fitting. falls just above the knee and does not rid",1
"I took these out of the package and wanted them to fit so badly, but i could tell before i put them on that they wouldn't. these are for an hour-glass figure. i am more straight up and down. the waist was way too small for my body shape and even if i sized up, i could tell they would still be tight in the waist and too roomy in the hips - for me. that said, they are really nice. sturdy, linen-like fabric, pretty color, well made. i hope they make someone very happy!",1
"I love the look and feel of this tulle dress. i was looking for something different, but not over the top for new year's eve. i'm small chested and the top of this dress is form fitting for a flattering look. once i steamed the tulle, it was perfect! i ordered an xsp. length was perfect too.",1
"I'm upset because for the price of the dress, i thought it was embroidered! no, that is a print on the fabric. i think i cried a little when i opened the box. it is still ver pretty. i would say it is true to size, it is a tad bit big on me, but i am very tiny, but i can still get away with it. the color is vibrant. the style is unique. skirt portion is pretty poofy. i keep going back and forth on it mainly because of the price, although the quality is definitely there. except i wish it were emb",1
"First of all, this is not pullover styling. there is a side zipper. i wouldn't have purchased it if i knew there was a side zipper because i have a large bust and side zippers are next to impossible for me.

second of all, the tulle feels and looks cheap and the slip has an awkward tight shape underneath.

not at all what is looks like or is described as. sadly will be returning, but i'm sure i will find something to exchange it for!",0
"Loved the material, but i didnt really look at how long the dress was before i purchased both a large and a medium. im 5'5"" and there was atleast 5"" of material at my feet. the gaps in the front are much wider than they look. felt like the dress just fell flat. both were returned. im usually a large and the med fit better. 36d 30 in jeans",0
I have been waiting for this sweater coat to ship for weeks and i was so excited for it to arrive. this coat is not true to size and made me look short and squat. the sleeves are very wide (although long). as a light weight fall coat the sleeves don't need to be as wide because you wouldn't be layerng too much underneath. the buttons need to be moved at least three inches in for a nicer fit. i thought about redoing the buttons myself but the sleeves looked even more out of proportion with a tigh,0
"I ordered this 3 months ago, and it finally came off back order. a huge disappointment. the fit wasn&#39;t so much the issue for me. the quality of the wool is subpar. someone else mentioned a &quot;felted wool&quot;...i guess, is that what you call it?  it does literally feel like felt! super thin, itchy, doesn&#39;t drape very well, and feels cheap (made in china). i got it on sale, but still not worth what i paid. definitely going back.",0
"This is such a neat dress. the color is great and the fabric is super soft. i am tall so the long length was an added bonus. it definitely needs something underneath since the front gaps. i am going to pair it with a funky tank top, necklaces and boots. super cute!!",1
Super cute and comfy pull over. sizing is accurate. material has a little bit of stretch.,1
"Pretty and unique. great with jeans or i have worn it to work with slacks and heels. the colors, print, and embroidery are lovely. reasonably priced!",1
"Tried this on today at my local retailer and had to have it. it is so comfortable and flattering. it's too bad the picture online has the model tucking it into the skirt because you can't see the ruching across the front. a little dressier alternative to a plain tee and reasonably priced for retailer. 5'8"""" and i generally wear a 6, the small fit well. will probably be back for the black!",1
I bought this item from online... the fit on the model looked a little loose but when i got mine it seemed a bit tight! so i took it back to the store & ordered a larger size. for the sale price this is a great top.,1
"I absolutely love this bib tee! it's probably my favorite retailer purchase of all time. i'm 5'7"", 140 pounds and the small was a perfect fit for me. i typically wear either a s or m tops.",1
"Love the color and style, but material snags easily",1
"Nice top. armholes are a bit oversized but as an older woman, i'm picky about that. the print is pretty and unusual. it just didn't look great on me. there's a slight peplum in the back that hangs nicely. it's a lightweight tee fabric that's opaque. i tried it on with a black bra which was barely visible. great for warmer climates but there are so many gorgeous tops out now, that i decided to return since summer is winding down. i do recommend.",1
This is an adorable top that i find to be extremely comfortable. i don't usually buy prints but this one is so feminine and looks great with dark wash jeans. i am a 36d and the medium was a perfect fit.,1
"I am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra. it's soft and fits okay, but it has zero support or shape. i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support. if i would have seen this is the store, i would have passed over it. however, i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it. it's comfortable so that's a redeeming quality. i would not recommend for larger chested ladies, though!",0
This tank fit well and i loved the ruffle in the back and how it layed. but the front was not a good look and i will be retuning it.,0
"This dress is simply beautiful and stunning. it is so figure flattering and i can't wait to wear it. size small worked for me, and since i'm tall it fell right to my ankle which is perfect for me. i could not be happier with the purchase and the keyhole in the back is a beautiful detail.",1
"3 tags sewn in, 2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3''). very itchy so i cut them out. then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy! how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all! also - i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work. i am a b cup. however, this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup - so for me this would only be a lounging bralette - if it wasn't so itchy!",0
"I really loved this top online and wanted to love it in person. it is soft and the patter is okay in person. the neckline is higher than i am used to. also, there are two buttons in the back that must be unbuttoned in order to wear the top. it is difficult to button them behind your neck with the top on. unfortunately i had to return this item...",0
"I really wanted this to work. alas, it had a strange fit for me. the straps would not stay up, and it had a weird fit under the breast. it worked standing up, but the minute i sat down it fell off my shoulders. the fabric was beautiful! and i loved that it had pockets.",0
"Why do designers keep making crop tops??!! i can't imagine this would be flattering on anyone, especially someone average height and well endowed on top. i looked like a football player. the pattern and fabric are gorgeous, so if you are like 4' tall and super tiny and can fit xxs this may work? i am between a 6-8 and fit a small and it was huge on me and almost was bigger at the bottom than the top. such a weird cut. there is a cami underneath so if it rides up that will show but that is so 80s",0
"I love this top. it is loose and comfortable. it is not sheer so you don't need a cami. it runs a little large so size down if you want a more tailored fit. 1 criticism, it catches on sharp jewelry or belts and can pull if you are not careful.",1
"The zipper broke on this piece the first time i wore it. very disappointing since i love the design. i'm actually going to try to replace the zipper myself with something stronger, but annoying that it's come to that.",0
"This dress is adorable - it's a perfect casual look for summer and the quality is nice with the lining (though still overpriced, in my opinion). the tie detail is somewhat adjustable, and i found my normal size s to fit fine (5'7, 128#). where this gets me is the fact that it's dry clean...totally doesn't make sense for a dress that is essentially a fancy tshirt for summer. i might bring it back for that alone, since i originally planned to wear it a lot. :(",1
"I am usually a petite 6 but since this dress did not come in petites i tried on 4 and it fit. i'm 5'1"" -112lbs so dress hit rt below knee -will have it hemmed up a bit do not so overwhelming.

this dress looks stunning on! great vibrant color ( i have dark hair) makes this classic elegant dress look contemporary and stylish. when i tried it on in store, salesperson and others who happen to see it on me raved and told me to grab it! i did and am glad.

i plan to wear it this spring for my daughte",1
"I purchased this top in an antro store last week. the quality is wonderful and the greenish blue color is very unique. the blouse has a beautiful stretchy camsiole that is attached at the shoulders, but can be removed by snaps. i tooks great when worn two different ways. i wore it with the campole out, and it peeks through the blouse at the bottom. it also looks great when the camisole is worn in. my only wish is that it would come in a petite size as it's a touch big at the shoulders and neckli",1
"I was really hoping to like this, but it did not look the way it does on the model, at least not on me. the sharkbite hem is much more pronounced and looser. the one in the photo looks like it was pinned back. i am 5'8"" and usually wear a medium or large. i got a medium and there was a lot more material on the bottom half than the photo shows. it made me look bigger and was not flattering. material has a nice weave but it's thin and delicate. i bought the (holly) deep olive and the blue. colors",0
"Really cute piece, but it's huge. i ordered an xxs petite and it was unfortunately extremely wide and not flattering. returning.",0
"I love cute summer dresses and this one, especially because it is made out of linen, is unique. it is very well-made with a design that is quite flattering. i am 5 foot 6 and a little curvy with a 38 c bust and i got a size 10. it fits well although it is difficult to zip up because the material has no give. the perfect dress to wear to italy or france! now i just have to book my tickets!",1
"I usually wear a medium and bought a small. it fit ok, but had no shape and was not flattering. i love baby doll dresses and tops, but this was a tent. my daughter saw me try it on and said ""that's a piece of tablecloth."" it's going back.",0
"I was very excited to order this top in red xs. so cute, but it was huge, shapeless and support thin! it had to go back. i should've looked at other reviews.",0
"I am in need of easy comfortable tops for everyday wear. i bought this top mostly because of the cute buttons. when i received it, it looked exactly as it does in the picture online, however, the buttons kept slipping out of their homes because the holes were slightly too big. the shirt fit but was just a tad snug near the upper arms, which would stretch and loosen up throughout the day. it's definitely a comfortable shirt, but it felt more like a pajama top. it's going back.",0
The fabric felt cheap and i didn't find it to be a flattering top. for reference i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are 38-30-40.,0
"Runs big and looked unflattering. i am petite, might work on someone taller.",0
This is so thin and poor quality. especially for the price. it felt like a thin pajama top. the buttons are terrible little shell buttons. this could not have been returned faster.,0
"This dress is comfortable and stylish at the same time. it runs true to size. i'm 5'1"" 113 lbs and got the xs petite. wore it once so far for a few hours and got a few compliments on it!",1
"The design/shape of the dress are quite flattering, flirty and feminine. but.... there is no way that the dress i received is new. the color is a faded washed out red and there are black stains all over the belt area. there is no tag... the fabric looks droopy and laundered and is not crisp, stiff or new. i am very disappointed by the quality of the item that i received. undoubtedly this one is going back.

dear retailer - please make sure that you do not send pre-owend clothing articles to",0
"First, the fabric is beautiful and lovely for spring and summer. i really wanted to like this top, but the fitting is so awkward for me. i typically where a 0/xs, and sized up in the shirt to a size 2. it was very tight and pulled funny across the chest (size 32/a). i also found the cut at the shoulders very narrow (need a strapless bra) and made it look unflattering overall. had to return this one back to the store.",0
Great look and you can wear this vest with almost everything . i normally wear a small but they only had mediums and it fit fine( i like it tied). this will stay in my closet all year round . it does look like it will wrinkle easily but that doesn't bother me . a must buy !,1
"I was so excited to try out this top since it was such a bargain and neutral. unfortunately, the shape is ""a"" line and accentuates the hip area a bit more than i find flattering. so, it will be returned.",0
"I read the previous reviews and had hoped that the exclamations about the color being inaccurate were exaggerated- however they are sadly very true. let me be clear that this is a beautiful, comfortable piece of clothing- when you put it on it feels thick and of very good quality. and while the pattern is interesting and pretty, the ""dark orange"" color i was expecting is actually a mud brown. i think it's unfortunate that retailer misrepresented such a key element of the jacket, but i digress. the",1
"It's ok, fit doesn't wow me because of my body. chest is too wide, hips look too narrow. drapes across my back fat in an especially non-flattering way. basically made my square-apple body look more square-apple. great part about this dress is that it's comfy and hides the tummy pooch. construction is poorly done...contrasting liner at v-neck is rolling out on one side only and then doing the same at the hem contralaterally. another negative point is dry clean only. boo. i'm 5'3"" 140# 39-28-35 an",1
"It's a pretty top, but it runs very short. the back is also pretty see through so i'm not sure i will keep it. it's called off the shoulder but it is so tight when you try and actually wear it off the shoulder. great design, just not sure i will keep it due to length",1
"My firned tried this on and her first comment was ""take it off, it is scratchy"", so i didn't bother trying it on. it is, however, beautiful, if you are not sensitive to scratchy material.
fit was true to size.",0
"Like other reviewers noted, the pics don't do this skirt justice. it is truly beautiful with an intricate lace pattern and rich colors. can't wait to wear this to work!",1
"Not keeping this one. the fabric is a bit tacky-looking in person, the cut is odd and it's just not me. fit is fine and there are snaps to keep the neckline flat and shaped, the colors are as shown and it is a good length (falls to top of hip). i simply did not like it. too metallic looking maybe...",0
The top as with most of ap's tops is well stitched. material is very uncomfortable. if you have large bust it is a little divulging. this may prompt you to wear something underneath to look modest and change the shape of the top!,1
"I love the metallic colors of this top and figured i could wear it under a ruched jacket and circle skirt for work. welp, that's out the window. this design is poor. for one, this is not a piece for a petite woman with no torso and i don't know how anyone with a longer torso wears t his. this hits above my belly botton on and i got apetite 2. i have no torso. so, without a jacket, i would never wear this. it's very low cut..the back is very low..it's a little loose but i run between a 2 and a 4.",1
"This is a lovely pencil skirt that is well-made and really brightens a work day. like a lot skirts with multiple colors, a lot of tops feel like they should match but you have to try a few that really work with the skirt and your look to get the right impact.",1
So  disappointed that no where in the limiting did it mention this suit is australian in size!! i ordered the 10 (i'm usually an 8 but that was sold out) and the suit arrives and doesn't even fir over my hips. -- the label clearly says 10 australian us 6!  gutted that i have to return this suit because of this sizing issue.  the suit looks to be well made and the design is adorable of it only for.,0
"This is a very pretty top with vibrant metallic colors. i would be perfect for a holiday party or going out to dinner. it wasn't as scratchy as i thought it would be based on the reviews, however, it ran a little big. i'm 5.3 and about 130 pounds and i almost always wear a size 6, but the six was too big. i'd recommend sizing down. it was also lower cut than i thought it would be....showed a lot of cleavage (i'm a 34d) so it's not work appropriate. .",1
"Love everything about this beautiful coat except the way it fits on me.  it is just perfect in the shoulders but once it flares out at the bottom, i look like a clown costume.  if i size down it will not fit in my shoulders.  perhaps a tailor can install buckles that match the neckline buckle to the sides of the coat to fold in the flare.  on another note the buckle at the neckline feels very hard and fake, not sure if it's real leather.",1
"The title says it all....this fabric of this top is both the best and worst part of the design. the colors are vibrant and the combination of materials (shoulder is a knit, sweater-like navy fabric) is interesting. however, that is where the positive comments end on this one. the top is so scratchy,, stiff, and, frankly, uncomfortable. i cannot imagine wanting to wear it. it could benefit from a lining, and that might have solved the problem of scratchy, itchy fabric.

the stiff fabric of the bo",0
The online picture does not do this skirt justice. it's very pretty and unique in design. i think it should be worn with a tighter shirt that is tucked in unlike the picture. this is truly a pretty pencil skirt.,1
These pants are fun! i use them as sleep pants. i had to size up because the waist band was a little tight for comfort.,1
"The colors are vivid and perfectly autumnal but the fit is a mess. it was overall too large, the waistline curves up in the front and then falls into small pleats which was maternityish, the waistband was thicker than the dress and sat away from my body and the material was a cheapish poly. had the outer dress been made from the same material as the lining, i would have liked it better. the modesty closure was a plus but the dress was already unraveling when i took it out. #returned",0
"Love this tunic! i am a curvy gal (with a few extra 'curves' in the middle) and this is a perfect top for accentuating the good and masking the negative. i purchased the pink color and it is a gorgeous peachy- pink, a much deeper color than what is portrayed in the picture. i found it true to size. typically i wear a medium or large, depending on the structure and the medium fit well. a little more fitted on top and looser around the waist. i came back to buy another in the ivory but alas, it is",1
"Beautiful color,, great quality, and great fit if you size up! i learned my lesson with previous purchases and sized up when i read it runs small. i usually wear a 0/2 and i took a risk and went for the 4. it fits perfectly. i have a 25 in waist.",1
"Online, this looks like a great sweater. i ordered an xxsp and found that this sweater is much wider in the middle than pictured. in fact, i'm pretty sure they pinned the shirt in the back for the picture to make it appear slimmer. unfortunately, this sweater will not work for me, as i am an hourglass shape and this shirt makes me look 20 pounds heavier.",0
"I was worried about this item when i ordered it because of how it looks in the picture, but i had wishful thinking. i should have gone with my gut! this shirt does not have the same quality as all my other retailer purchases. it is see-through and flimsy. the bottom is just like the picture, it hangs in an odd rumpled way. the top is very flattering though, so it's a shame! if the bottom fit nicer like their other products i could have gotten away with wearing a cami under it to make up for the qu",0
"My waist measures 28"" and the size 4 is a snug fit. i normally buy size 2 in retailer skirts, but the 2 was unbearably tight. cute skirt though! i like that it's machine washable, and the quality looks good.",1
"I was minimally torn over whether to return this but ultimately it's going back because the knit is just too thin. i thought it would be cozy and be of normal sweater weight but it's not. and because it's so light, the swing effect doesn't really come off. nothing special.",0
"Finally a ""swing top"" that doesn't look like a sack on me! i've been wanting to partake of this current style, but everything i've tried so far just looks ""dumpy"" on me. not this top -- it is very feminine and flattering. i am 5'7"" 118 lbs and have a small waist -- and although this is a ""swing"" style, it still shows my waist and doesn't overpower me. it is also a lovely fabric -- especially in the soft pink which i got. i'm thinking of going back for more colors!",1
"Unlike the other reviewers, i did not have any problem with the sizing, fit or length of this skirt. it is a midi skirt so i think it's suppose to be a little bit longer?? for me it fit true to size. for reference i am 5'8"", 135 pounds and the size 6 fit perfectly. i think the color is beautiful and the quality is good.",1
"For a now feel, that comfy and well made, this was a great choice!",1
"This skirt looks exactly as pictured and fits great. i purchased it a few weeks ago and got lots of compliments on it. however, on the third wear, the side zipper split wide open. needless to say, it was returned.",0
"Dang, i got a small and was still swimming in it. it's made of the fabric that increasingly seems to be the fabric of choice for all things t-shirty- soft and thin-ish, a bit translucent. i'd rather wait for something more formfitting and flattering- back it went.",0
"Bought this item on sale and was very disappointed in the quality for the cost. fabric feels cheap, like it will snag easily and will stretch out quickly. did not flatter the female form- felt like a burlap sack. gorgeous blue color but not worth the price tag. returned it.",0
"I loved this top; it reminded me of one i have from retailer from circa 2008 in black and white; however, on this one, the chest area is too big, in both the 14 and 16, and i even found myself tugging downward on the fabric to keep it in place because the waist is elastic and also too big. i probably need a size 12, but then i fear it would be too short-waisted on me, for i am 5'10"". unfortunately, it is not for me. also, the sleeves are much bigger and flouncier than they appear in the photo on t",0
"I love the rich deep color and the style but once again this brand runs really small in the waist. i am normally a 8/10 in retailer skirts and the size 10 was tight at the waist enough so i could not button it and feel comfortable. the quality is ok, something i feel i would see at another type of discount store. for me this skirt did not work but the color and softness of the fabric was a plus.",0
"Great shirt to wear with white pants and wedges. i'm a teacher and this is perfect for warmer months for school or for casual evening out. it runs big but falls in such a way that it doesn't make the wearer look big; it falls elegantly and in a flattering way.

great, versatile shirt.",1
Love the fabric of this shirt even though it was thinner than i expected. it is soft to the skin and flattering. however i returned it because it is made for women with long torso and shorter shoulders.,0
"The skirt that i received had very little blue or green in it, and was mostly white, yellow and some red. the fit was fine but the quality for the price was not there for me. the lack of quality and the disappointment in the quality equals a return.",0
"Bought a large, could barely pull up over my butt. runs extremely small. it's cute but if your not a stick figure, this is not the suit for you.",0
"Adorable... too chilly now to wear alone & too cute to cover it up! my navy parka or jean jacket will prob be ok w/ it though. size 6 fits me perfectly & looks pretty much on me as in the pic. love plaid & cotton blend tops anyways. ruffles - adorable, & i'm not too big on that but do love this look. when i first removed this top from the packaging it had an odd 'smoky'-like odor, but it's the dye i think. after hanging it for a few days the smell disappeared. i have in mind to wear w/ the pilcr",1
"This dress makes you feel like a bohemian goddess.  falls in the right area and absolutely adorable.  the dress is very fragile, handle with care.",1
"The inseam is advertised as 28"", but they are more like 38"". i was hoping they were for short people, but they are for someone with very long legs, event in my tallest heels, i'd have to get them hemmed! just a warning to my short friends out there. the quality, fit, look was great, but way way way too long.",1
"This top is really pretty and nice quality. runs big - i went down a size, and its perfect. coloring is more subtle in person than in the photo.",1
"The shirt is absolutely cute looking. but that's just that....looks. i'm 5'2"" size 6 & wears m to l top. i tried on the medium in the store, it was rather flowing. i liked it. but i didn't like how it fit on the underarm area. it hung very low. so i ordered a petite m. still the same. plus the store the lighting was dark so i didn't realize how see through the shirt was too. had to return it.",0
"I ordered this top in my usual size and am exchanging it for one size smaller.
it runs very generous, and so the sizing is a little off.
the style and quality are beautiful, so i am anxious to receive the smaller size.",1
I have a similar pair of capris from retailer and when i ordered these i thought they were the same in a different color. these are less flattering and i may not keep them.,0
"I love the style of this top, and the longer length would be great with leggings and fitted shorts. it's somewhat fitted on the top yet it's a-line shape gives a full swing at the bottom. the ruffled v-neckline is pretty, and i like the longer length of the short sleeves. but with all these attributes, unfortunately they cut the armholes really big, so when you put your arms forward, the sleeves pull against your arms. i was trying to decide if i should keep it anyway, but for $98 dollars i thin",0
"I loved this dress from the moment i tried it on. so flattering to my postpartum body without being a huge tent. soft fabric, and for a white/lightly striped dress, not sheer. i'm bummed because after washing only twice (followed the instructions to wash) on gentle cycle and low tumble dry, holes started appearing everywhere, both on the cream ribbed hem in the front bottom and all across the chest, in the white part of the fabric only (it looks like the black stripes are holding the holes toget",0
"I went ahead and ordered a size up based on previous reviews, but i should have ordered my own size, as they're a bit loose around the waist. the pants are adorable and the pinstripes very flattering, so i definitely recommend them!",1
"Love pilcro, love the stripes and the length - but this particular pair of capris/crops are super tight fitting. i went up a size from my usual and still felt tight. i guess its just the cut/fabric combo. i wanted it to be a slightly less form fitting feel ...... may work for you, however!",1
"Really pretty, but runs at least a full size small.",1
"I love this tunic the natural color is just that, this is a tunic so the fit is a little large. i kept it and had it altered because i really do love this top",1
"I purchased this top in a regular small and surprisingly, it fits me very well (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). the hem falls about two inches longer than shown on the model. i like the v-neck the most because the ruffles are not too much, and it's not too low cut. i purchased the white color because i think the pattern is unique and it's brighter for spring/summer. i think skinny jeans and ankle boots or wedges would make the look very stylish. by the way, the fabric is super soft (but not w",1
"Fits well through the shoulders and arms, but there is zero waist, and it just looks like a bunch of extra fabric hanging from the top. super cute, but have to return because of that.",0
"I really wanted to love this t and was excited to receive it in the mail. i thought i was being realistic in assuming that is would be somewhat sheer given that there doesn't seem to be a woman's white t on the planet that isn't these days, however it was really sheer. the fit was also short and boxy (this coming from a 5'3 woman who is short-waisted) on the plus size the material is extremely soft and the design is cute. maybe if you are younger and don't mind the sheerness it's worth the gambl",0
"This is a perfect jacket over any shirt, tee, or dress. jacket is well made and goes with anything!",1
I liked the color of this top but i didn't really like the ruffled stitching around the middle. it looks like someone just tacked on the bottom half. i bought this for my daughter and she likes it. i think it is comfortable and a good top to knock around in.,1
"I have alst year's version,a dn they are essentially the smae, minus some leather parts removed... this jacket is great, the back si a little shorter, so it goes so well with peplum tops an ddresses with higher waists (without looking bigger from the back when the hem is longer and hits where the skirt aprts bulge out). i love hte darker color, i wish it came is super dark rinse...

i usually buy petites, but i never tired on the eptite in this jacket... i am holding myself back to order this on",1
"Comfy sweatshirt with fun polka dot details. soft and not baggy. a little on the shorter side so i think i will layer a lace cami underneath and it will look even prettier. i'm 5'7"", 140 pounds with an athletic, hourglass shape, 32dd. i bought the ""2"" which equates to a medium since i wanted it a little looser being a sweatshirt (i'm normally an retailer small but i don't think that would have worked in this case as it would have been too fitted). great comfy weekend piece!",1
"I could wear this every day, it is stylish and comfortable",1
"Love this top!
it is a full/ swing top, but the slightly shorter length balances out the fullness perfectly.
i have been wearing it with a contrasting fitted cami and get tons of compliments.
love both colors, and having fun wearing them.
and after one washing the fullness is softer and looks like the pic.
runs true to size and in the arms slightly tight, so i went with my usual med and fits perfect.
if you have issues with sleeve size would recommend going up a size, otherwise very true to size",1
"The styling of this top is really cute. it fits perfectly on the shoulders and gets bigger at the hem for the baby doll look. my biggest complaint is the quality! it's really cheap and feels like the quality i would expect to see at a cheap retailer. it catches lint like crazy and because the hem is just a pearl edge, it curls really badly. i buy quite a bit from here and this is the worst quality item i have seen in a long time. not worth the $$ if paying full price.",1
"Love, love, love this dress. it is very slimming. it hugs you without really touching you. leaving the tie and a few buttons open gives it more of a casual feel.",1
"This dress is gorgeous!!! i love it! i bought it to wear to a july wedding. i got the navy and it is so fresh and crisp in color. the sizing is on spot! i slipped it on and it was comfortable, easy and stylish. i am 5'7"" and typically xs. it falls exactly as portrayed in the online photos. it is lined in the skirt and the top is stretch jersey in the best weight! i am in love!",1
"Like the other reviewer said this top is extremely wide and boxy. it must be pinned in the picture online. it's very frustrating when they do that. thank goodness i didn't pay for shipping! for reference, i'm 5'2 and 135 pounds and bought the xxs, it's going back for sure. i'm trying to lose baby weight, not trying to look pregnant!",0
"I wanted to love this sweatshirt, but alas, it is going back. upon opening and unfolding, the first thing i noticed: the dots and not solid. they are sort of distressed looking, with parts of them missing. secondly, it doesn't have a lot of structure. it's soft and kind of floppy but in a weird way. it's just not flattering on me. it looks more like a pajama top than something i would wear out of the house. for reference, i ordered the 3, and i'm usually a 10/12 in tops.",0
The cut is brilliant-the wash is subtle-the weight of the denim is sturdy but not stuff-and the stretch is just right. love it. the perfect staple. a scarf in the fall and rolled sleeves in the spring.,1
"I've been looking at this jacket on line and finally went to the store to try it on. i really liked the styling but the denim was quite stiff. i'd prefer a softer kind of fabric. i wonder if it would soften if it was washed. also, it ran surprisingly small. i usually take an xsmall or small but the small didn't leave me enough room to comfortably bend my arms. the medium worked better. i wonder how others feel about the fabric and and the sizing. i think i'll wait and see if this one goes on sal",1
"Beautiful colors and silhouette (i got the navy). the skirt is lined and flows wonderfully when you walk. i've gotten a ton of compliments on it. i'm 5'9"" and the high hem falls a few inches below my knee, and the low hem falls to my ankles.",1
"Looks beautiful online but has too much material and the zipper catches on the lace. also runs very large, i am normally a small but would need and xs in this dress",0
True to size on the neckline and arms but extremely large and puffy in the torso. very unflattering cut!,0
"I purchased the floral patterned version and get complimented every time i wear it. i found it to be pretty true to size, even after washing. it's a little sheer, so you'd definitely want to wear a camisole underneath for work. it's a great top for spring/summer!",1
"I thought this top was adorable in the store and online. it just didn't work for me. although it fit, it flares out too much in the front and just wasn't flattering on me. i am 5' 5"" and 128 lbs. and ordered the small.",0
"I really like this blouse a lot. very very easy to wear!! i wore with pencil skirt to work and with skort as shown similar on model with sandals on weekend. very flattering and great blue color!!! very happy with this purchase. highly recommend. i am 5'6"" short torso and my usual 6 worked.",1
"This blouse is so pretty. i love the long tie. the pattern is very unique. it is a thin, light weight fabric so you can easily wear it underneath a leather jacket.",1
"Like another reviewer mentioned, this shirt is way too short. i'm only 5'2"" (xs) and there is no way this top would tuck in like on the model. also, the quality isn't great as it's very thin and there are strings hanging from some of the seams in the front. it's a shame b/c the print is really pretty and there is this cute little bicycle charm on the tag which makes it feel more unique. sadly, it's going back!",0
"I didn't think anything of this top online (i really don't care for how they styled it) but in store it was more interesting. i'm currently anywhere between a 2-4-6 / xs-s-m, depending on the style, 5'3"" 120lb 34b. size 2 regular in this top fit me perfectly. for some reason, on me, the sleeves were elongating and flattering (closer to my elbow) and the overall length hit me perfectly at the hip like on the model, the fabric is lightweight and therefore slightly sheer but, due to the color and p",1
Nice fabric and cute design. a little low cut.,1
"I had high hopes for this top. really boxy, short",0
"This top was way too short (i'm only 5'1) and way too wide. the cut of this top was so wide, it looked like a tent on me. i really wanted to love this top because the material and style (sleeves, ruffle) are beautiful, unfortunately there is something wrong with the cut. i've have several blouses made by one fine day, which fit nicely, for some reason this top did not. i ordered in my usual s size, even going to an xs would not work because the cut is wrong.",0
Ordered the shirt online. beautiful print and good quality material. runs very large - size down 1 may be 2 sizes as the material on the body is very wide. i will be exchanging it in the store.,1
Gorgeous in every way except its length and how it hangs at the bottom. i prefer a shirt i can wear tucked in or out. this one will work well tucked in but not out so i am returning disappointed it was so well done in other particulars.,0
"I bought this in a petite size s after trying on the regular size in the store. it was a good move because the proportions in length and width are more flattering. the pattern is busy but works well with patterns in the same color group. it has no finished seams on any edge but that makes it drape nicely. it is a soft, soft fabric, almost fleece-like but not plush.",1
"This top light and airy, which is perfect for spring. i'm usually into these types of blouses; however, this didn't quite fit right on me. it's a little too boxy and too low cut in the front for some reason. i loved the design and really wanted to like it... i just didn't love it enough to purchase it.",0
"This blouse is so beautiful - the collar, sleeves, material...everything except the cut! it was like a tent. it needed to be more tapered, which would be easy to do while still maintaining the beautiful breezy flow, and be about two inches longer.

i had been drooling over this top for awhile and was so disappointed! please fix it and then i will buy again. i am 5'4"", 140lbs and busty...a small was perfect, with the exception of the massive amount of material.",0
"Very pretty blouse. i love the print, and color of the pink floral. tts, i ordered the xs, because of the roomy cut of the blouse. i'm 5'8"", 117 lbs. it fit great. the cut is a little wider then pictured, but still cute. not to short as mentioned by another review, and i have a longer torso, i wasn't crazy about the victorian collar, so tucked it under, and it looks great!",1
"Not a coat by any means, merely a thin wool boucle like sweater with a cheap thin synthetic lining ---and i also would never want the lining to be seen by anyone if i were to set the sweater on a chair or be helped in putting the thing on. the length and bulk is hard to layer under anything else and isn't pretty enough for a spring coat..sizing is also 2 sizes larger than anticipated.",0
"I saw this in-store, tried it on, and was sold. it is not just super soft but very flattering on. i am petite, 105 lbs and bought the xs in black- the sleeves are short enough that no petite size was needed. i will wear this a lot with both skirts and jeans.",1
"The fabric was nothing special (i usually like a cotton/silk blend woven fabric, but this was stiff feeling) and the pattern was cute. but what made me return it was the fact that 1) the rose gold glitter dots are puffy paint. literally. puffy. paint. and 2) the dots were not quite dry on my top when it arrived. parts of the paint came off on my fingers and the top was stuck to itself because of it. i could barely unfold it.

i'm sure this could have been cute, but who wants a top that looks lik",0
This top is good quality and cute. it runs large- i'm usually a medium and needed a small. the reason i will be returning it is because it flares out at the bottom on the black which is very unflattering on. it makes me look wide in the waist or like i'm wearing a maternity top. unfortunate because i really liked everything else about it.,0
"This blouse is super cute but oddly sized. i bought a size up and still i squeezed into the top around the bust. the front slit is too low and shows a bit too much cleavage, so this had to go back. i really tried because the fabric is wonderful and the shirt is light and breezy for summer, i just couldn't make it work
.",0
"I love the sweatshirt 
 clay color is very different it's a nice light fabric with nice detailed edges 
 although it is an oversized piece it hangs and fits well although i am petite
 great light sweatshirt for spring and summer",1
"I love maeve and was so excited for this top which looked like an update from a last season favorite. unfortunately the fabric was stiff, it was tight in the chest and went straight down from there. returned.",0
All the rave reviews are true!  this vest is plush and funky and i love wearing it. i'm having fun figuring out different outfits to wear with this. this is a great three season layering piece and i'm thrilled i was able to get it on sale.  my only regret was the lack of a petite selection.,1
I love this top. i got it on sale and am so glad that i did. it is a short too but still super flattering. it isn't too boxy on me.,1
"I was skeptical about this duster and had to see it in person, and it was love at first sight. the black and white makes it versatile, and the pattern makes it interesting and fashion forward. more importantly, the pattern is cleverly designed which doesn't compete with your wardrobe should you wear a bright color or a similar pattern (as shown on model). i purchased the regular xs/s and it fit me fine (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, and 36 hips) and the hem falls about two inches below my knees. the",1
"I was looking for a basic tee, but this one was just ok...the quality is okay, but it us not as soft as i would have liked. unfortunately,  i will be returning this item.",0
Disappointed in the quality of the dress. love the style and especially the colors. the fabric of the body of the dress is very very thin and just poorly made. the top bodice is more substantial. not worth the price tag of $148.00. dress does run short.,0
"This skirt is very short. i ordered my usual xs petite and it was so short that the longest part ended above my ankle. that's quite off because i'm only 5 feet tall, and i wore it pretty low on the hips. it also flares out awkwardly below the knee. there are 2 vertical seems and they exacerbate the jagged appearance of the hem. i was drawn to the edgy style shown in the photo but in person it looks like my 5 year old cut up a skirt. plus, the fabric--while thick and beautiful and stretchy--has a",0
"I don't normally review my purchases, but i was so amazed at how poorly this dress was made, i couldn't help myself but to post a review. the neck line isn't even hemmed down so it flaps up. the material is thin and feel cheap. this dress isnt even worth $20 in my opinion. i was expecting a well made, good quality dress for the high price tag.",0
"Ordered this dress online, and i love it! i was looking for an understated but fun new years dress and this was exactly what i was looking for. the only minor qualm i had about the dress was that the velvet dots that hit where the seams met made the dress look puffier than it should some parts around the waist, but for the most part, the dress fit very well and was very flattering, may just need a little bit of ironing. i am 5'9 and usually am more conscious of how things fit around my hips, and",1
"If your hips are bigger than a size 6 us you can't fully close this robe. the model must be wearing the larger of the two sizes to have such a nice oversized fit. the fabric is soft and lux and amazing, but the weird dart in the back and the closure is right over my sadly size 8 hips and butt. if i was taller and thinner i would have kept this and worn it every day.",1
"I should have exchanged it for a smaller size, but i wanted to wear it, so my mistake. i tend to wear size 12-14, and the large is entirely too big. it also had piling right out of the bag. but it is just so soft that i tore the tag off and wore it anyway. if you get this, size down for sure.",1
"I'm surprised other reviewers loved this one so much. it's completely different then how it looks on the model. it's much shorter, which others do mention, but it flares a lot. enough to feel maternity-ish on me. it looks fitted on the model. maybe it's my shape, i have a short torso and carry weight in my hips. i ordered an xs too. i will say the material
is very nice and it's well made, but it's going back.",0
"This sweater is fine for the casual days. i bought this in cream and i have to say after one wash it looks old. i'm a huge retailer lover and buy a lot of clothes from them. this is just not the best quality and looks tired after a few wears. very soft, but poor material. not my favorite purchase.",0
"Great fit! no bagging and sagging and they fit true to size. very cute! for reference, i&#39;m 5&#39;2, 115 lbs and take a 26p. they look just like they do on the model. i highly recommend!",1
"I really wanted this dress to work out, but i was slightly disappointed in the fabric for the sleeves. the fit was accurate. i'm 5'7 and ordered a 6, however, my husband said it looked too little girl like. i did end up returning it :(",0
"I got this dress in hopes of having a really nice winter formal dress. it was not well made at all! the lining didn't line up with the top layer and the waist puffed out in uneven places. i am curvy so a puffy waistline in the last thing i need! the fabric itself is very nice, but just not well made. i do not recommend this dress.",0
"Soft, comfortable, stylish. i eagerly awaited the arrival of this beautiful sweater and was not disappointed. the sizing was accurate for a perfect fit and i love the feminine detailing and shape of the necklne. the ribbons add an extra touch of style to a sweater that is both casual and elegant at the same time. very versatile.",1
"This is my first pair of mcguire jeans, and i like the fabric and fit.  thank goodness for petite sizing!  these 32p fit just right on my hips, with no gap between the waistband and my body.  fits through thigh and hips and pretty slim all the way down.  nice stretch.  of course, the proof will be after wearing a few times and washing.  i will update my review if i do not like them so much after that,",1
I saw this dress online and immediately went to the store to try on! it took three sales asscoaites to help me zip the dress but once it was on it was beautiful! the bodice fits really nicely. true to size. there was extra fabric around the waist bust nothing that made the fit look weird. love love love!!! wearing for christmas eve!,1
"I really love this lace-up shirt, but i only liked it in black on me. i like it open like the model is wearing it, but i had to have it a little more closed because the lace part does go down a ways-and i felt like i was revealing a little too much. i would likely wear it open, but then have to pair it with a cami underneath to feel comfortable. i absolutely love the whole outfit as-pictured, and also reviewed the polka dot pants. i wish the laces were a little longer than they are-if you have i",1
"I love byron lars dresses, and this design is on-point. the ruffle at the neckline is so pretty, and the dress fits like a dream. however -- the fabric!!! i would have loved it if this dress had a heavier feel. this is, sadly, going back today.",0
"I purchased this jacket in green, x-small a while back and wasn?t 100% sure about it due to the size. i?m 5?3?, 117 lbs and a 33a and thought it was a little snug so i tried on the small and that was way too big so i kept the xs. i have worn it a few times and it does look great however i can only wear thin tops with it. recently i purchased the black, x-small and this i love. it?s looser then the green so i can get away with thicker tops. 
i do recommend both jackets. they are pricey for what",1
"I love this dress, i mean it si really pretty in person, however, the breast area is just too small... i can't wear a bra with it, and my ""older"" breasts just droop, not flattering. they are barely covered... i am a bit disappointed at that, but if you are smaller up there, i say give it a try... i am 115 lbs, 26.5 ion waist, 30dd and xs petite was great everywhere but chest.

colors and fabric are great, i love that the different colors are different types of fabric... too bad.",1
I'm 5'1 and 110 lbs.  i ordered this in a xsp and i could barely zip it up.  and when i did i couldn't breathe. i tried again and ordered a sp and it's perfect! now i just need somewhere to wear it.,1
"Beautiful shirt, hits me a little higher. i'm not sure i'm going to keep it just because i have something similar but its a beautiful top. i'm 5'6"" and carrying a little extra baby weight right now so i'm an 8-10 instead of my usual 6-8. i ordered an 8 and it fit well.",1
"I happened upon this in my local store despite the fact that it is an online exclusive. i love finding returns so i can see them in person. i loved the soft colors right away. my hesitation was the standup collar but it actually folds down just fine and gives the vest lapels too. it also looks nice belted, left slightly open. i usually wear small or xs in tops and the small fits nicely. it doesn't need to close since there are no built-in fasteners. i will wear it with a long button down shirt o",1
"I found this to fit tts. i sometimes wear petite, but found the petite sizing to be a little off. i have a pretty short torso, but found the petite to be too short. i opted for the regular sizing and got a 6; it fits great. this top is great for work (styled with a cardigan or blazer) or for play. i can see it dressing up or down very easily.",1
"The cut of this shirt is lovely and well thought out, the opening for the arm are not too big like some other shirts. i liked the material and the melon/ salmon color which i ordered was more vibrant in person. this does run large so i wished i had ordered one size down.",1
"I loved this dress as soon as i tried it on, but... it bunched up weird in the front around my hips. i ordered a second size 4, hoping that it would fit better. but same thing. if i tried to go to a size 6 it would be too big every where else. fyi - i'm 5'8"" 129lbs and i'm a runner. it's not like i have a huge backside or anything. my guess is sizing is off. i've tried another of his dresses and it fit perfectly.",0
"I'm usually an xs for most retailer dresses and shirts. i ordered up per other reviews and got a small. the small fits comfortably around my waist. the chest area is not made for large chests. my 34ds were barely contained. sad to say, i won't be keeping the dress. the layers, fabric, and colors are truly pretty but the design/fit is disappointing.",1
"I really like how this looks on the model, but in real life this top is much tighter. i was hoping for a good layering top and have been playing around with the trend of lace up tops. i bought it without trying on figuring a small would work, but it was much too tight and the lace top reminded me of vans shoes. i returned it, a girl much tinier than myself has it and it is very cute on her. so, best works on a model body type figure than someone with even slight hips.",0
"Three strikes and retailer is out for me! i am so disappointed. i really liked this dress and was looking for a fun, distinctive new shift dress. got it, tried it on, took it off, went back to look at the listing online...nowhere does it mention that it has a drop-seam in the shoulders. i guess you can see it if you zoom in closely on the image, but it's not mentioned in the text. who on god's green earth actually looks good with a drop-shoulder?! it hits every woman under 5'10"" right in the middl",0
It's hard enough for women to find clothing that will make them look as beautiful as they feel but add a bigger bust size (i'm a 36dd) and it makes it this much harder. i ordered this top because of how beautiful it looked on the model and the price. when it arrived i was so excited! retailer does such a beautiful job with the way they handle their items! it was wrapped beautiful and no damage. i ordered a size 8 knowing that my chest could be a potential problem. the too itself is gorgeous! i did,0
"Ordered this in white. it is really nice and sexy but very body hugging and unforgiving. perhaps it is my large stomach, but it hugs a bit too much for my liking. yet i think overall the design is very nice so i am keeping it and hoping i can lose some weight in my tum.",1
"I got to try this on today and i really like it. the fabric is a normal t-shirt kind of fabric (i was hoping it would have been kind of special) and the v-neck in the front does go down a ways so that some cleavage is showing. i would feel comfortable wearing it as-is outside of work, but would have to pair it with a cami if i would going to wear it to work. normally, i am not a huge fan of v-neck in the back and it drives me crazy thanks cami's these days are often made with a ""versatile"" v and",1
"When i first opened this dress and tried it on i thought it was adorable. it is very flattering on my hourglass figure and hides my recent baby weight. the problem is the hem. it was already rolling up when i took it out of the package, and i should have noticed and returned it, but i figured the problem would be easily solved by a good ironing. well, it wasn't, and it gets worse every time i wash the dress. it's like the hem isn't constructed properly.",0
"I love this sweater dress and get compliments every time i wear it.. i bought the navy in size xs. the pattern and colors are just fun and youthful, although you don't have to be young to look good in this dress. the dress is fitted, but the skirt flares, making it flattering if you have hips like me. the material is not too heavy so you can wear this 3 seasons fall, winter, spring. as other reviews have mentioned the dress is short. i am 5'9"" so it does hit well above my knees. this isn't an is",1
"I bought this in the white, size m (140lbs., 5'8"", 34b) because i wanted a baggy fit, which i got, so this is tts. the white is more of an off-white rather than a bright white, which i like because i happen to be looking for an off-white tee. and the shape is good--even in a larger size, this tee nips in at the waist.however, the quality of this tee is lacking, as it is the typical, cheap, marled, slightly see-through material that seems to be everywhere these days and the band on the back of th",0
Extremely flattering. an easy dress to wear - good choice for both day and evening,1

"Bought this in an xs and i liked the style of the skirt. it was long enough to wear to work. 
however the waist was too large and would not stay up on my waist. returned.",1

"I had it on my wish list for a long time, not sure whether i should purchase, i even hesitated when it went on sale, but boy, am i glad i did order it... it is crazy comfortable, flattering, and love that it looks black but is blue... i ordered both xs and xs p and decided to go with the petite as it will look super cute in the fall with boots. not too short (i am 5 foot 1.5)... the fake leather part concerned me at first, but i like it now... nothing bad ot say about it!",1
I had to order this blouse since it is named after the town i live in. it does not disappoint. the flowers are so pretty and it has great style. there is a little piece in the neckline so it is not too revealing. the sleeves are loose and cover the bra strap underneath. the back has a little bit of elastic so it does not look like a maternity shirt and it gives you some shape. i can't wait for it to warm up and to wear this!,1
This blouse is so pretty and well made. it will be a new favorite with dark jeans and boots. it is very boho and a lovely blouse to feel dressed up a bit on a jeans day. loose in a flattering way (it does not look like a maternity top). very happy!,1
"I love the layered look of this jacket. i got it in navy which matches everything. i think it's a little on the large side for me. i ordered a small. i'm 5'2"" 130 lbs. super comfortable. the inner layer is very soft. once you wash it, the outside is soft too. i've already worn mine several times. happy.",1
"I really wanted to love this dress, but it was so short! i'm only 5'6"" so i don't consider myself really tall, but the dress only came a couple of inches lower than my butt! way too short for me. my husband asked if it was a shirt or dress haha. but i think this would look adorable on someone a few inches shorter. or someone younger who can pull of a short shirt :)",1
"...there's enough room for a small family to live under the chest and trunk area of the blouse! sorry-had to say that! all kidding aside-since it's been thirty plus years ago since we were wearing these, many of us have forgotten what peasant blouses truly fit like. this is no exception- it is very billowy, flouncy, and roomy-more so even than today's peasant styles, i think. it is lovely and quite fitted across the chest -so that's how i ordered my size and it worked. i think if one sizes down",1
"Very cute, very comfortable. for me aesthetics and comfort must go hand in hand. this dress fits the bill.",1
Cropped and wide- would look cuter on someone who is more petite. was too wide and cropped for me. very sheer.,0
The fun colors drew me to this but it sure fit weird. the top was fine but it became a bit tent-like in the waist. the material doesn't feel great either.,0
Very comfortable and versatile. got lots of compliments.,1
"This dress is really cute in person. however, it did not fit me like it does the model in the pic at all. first of all i'm 5 feet 1 and it was wayyy too short on me. i didn't have the petit on either-- i had the regular xs. it just hits a couple of inches too short for me. i am 50. it would be adorable if i were more comfortable in shorter dresses. i wear short things a lot, but this was just too high on me. it was probably a good 8 inches above my knee. also it flared too dramatically at the wa",1
"This is one of my absolute favorites! the design is perfect, and the fabric is so beautiful. i don't love the coral color, but the mixed pattern is amazing. it runs a little large. i sized down one size and it fit perfectly. it's very flowy and comfortable. it's these unique, special designs that end of being my favorite retailer purchases. i've gotten so many compliments. very highly recommend!",1
"I'm assuming the model showing the sweater is at least 5'9"", it is slightly cropped on her , but it certainly doesn't look super cropped. i'm 5'4"" and its super cropped on me. even with high waist jeans.
also, it is incredibly itchy. i even tried it with a cami under but the itchy wool came right through the cami.
too bad, its a cute design, just needs some tweaking.",0
This dress looks great on me. it gives a slender appearance which hides a lot and it's easy and comfortable to wear.,1
Color is not like photo and fit doesn't work if you're busty,0
I absolutely love everything about this dress. it can be dressed up or down. no complaints.,1
"The colors are more vibrant than the photo indicates. indeed, though, the dress is very short and does pair well with leggings and boots.

i like that the dress highlights my hour glass figure, but with a generous nod to my curves with the accommodating skater skirt.

love it! will be easy to wear casually and work appropriate, too. the sale price was a huge bonus.",1
I love this top! not sure if i would picked it up in the store; i received it as a gift from my husband. kudos to him as it was a great choice. i love that the sheerness and lace make me feel a little sexy but the long sleeves and camisole offer the modesty i tend to crave. really beautiful and can be worn either with jeans or a dressier skinny pant for a night out. hd in paris never fails to please with their aesthetic and quality.,1
Love love love this jacket!! great spring and fall weather.. very stylish!!,1
I purchased this dress because i have a similar one with a linen skirt from the spring. the skirt on this dress is a heavier fabric and it lays very nicely. the top provides good coverage for my larger chest and i took my typical xs size. i would definitely recommend this purchase.,1
"This jacket looked so good and felt so comfortable on- i almost didn't send back the first one that arrived with a little bit of damage at the bottom of the inner zippered sweatshirt, but i did exchange it and am just as happy with the fit and feel of the second one. it hangs well no matter how you fasten the front, or leave it open. great looking, casual but stylish and neat. a good grey, and a good blue.",1
"Absolutely love this blouse but if your a woman cursed with larger arms for your body size than this is not for you. i couldn't get the lace part of the upper arms past my elbows.

oh well, it's going back!",0
"I thought that it looked like it belonged on a 15 year-old. i can almost see why they styled the model in what looks like ankle socks....ready for cheerleading. for reference it fits true to size, but is very short. i am 5'2"" and tried on a regular small - it was at least 5 inches above my knee.",0
"I just received these pants and i am very pleased.  they are a little longer than i expected them to be, but that actually works out well because now i can wear them to the office.",1
"Cute and pretty, runs a little wide and short, just slightly. i feel like i have that issue with all retailer clothes though. love the back.",1
"Wow the mixed reviews on this dress would make someone not get it at all.
it is true to size. i'm a 6 and the six fit as a glove on me.
the material is not at all stiff. i actually wished it was a bit more structured. but that didn't bother me.
i was able to close the zipper by myself.
i'm 5'7"" 144lb 36a.
the top feels confortable to me as well. i don't considered myself curve like jlo but i have hips. the dress does not make me feel bigger at all.
the only down side is that it looks more expens",1
"This top runs super small in the upper arms, shoulder area..could not even stretch out my arms! ...other then that major problem, the length and body fit were perfect...i am true med and/or large in all retailer tops so i tried sizes 10, 12 and neither worked for me due to arm/shoulder fit...disappointed because it really is a beautiful top...",0
"A nice alternative to jeans, good fit. i like the casual but edgy rocker look they have. will look good with booties and full length boots. i took the same size that i do in all pilcro pants.",1
"I love these! they are a perfect addition to my fall wardrobe, and just like all other pilcro jeans, they are a great fit and true to size.",1
"I'm surprised i'm the first to review this dress! it is a must for the holidays and any special occasion! it is absolutely gorgeous! it is so feminine and seductive; it's one of those dresses that would be stunning on anyone! it is a quality dress, beautifully made, looks just like the photo. i'm 5'9"" & the hemline falls at the top of my knees. the neckline is exquisite & really ""makes"" the dress. i purchased the black version but if i was younger i'd get it in red as it would garner quite a bit",1
The material is very soft and it looks just like it does on the model with the exception that it gets a little wrinkly at the hem and turns up at the corners. i like it and have already worn it a few times.,1
"Was drawn to this dress in the store. my location had it displayed well (one mannequin with the dress & a jean jacket...another with the faux fur cardigan). the dress is a very vibrant red. but the fit is not for me. i am busty (34c) with a short torso, and the dress made me look like dolly pardon on top. but there was a lot of room on the bottom. i tried on a size 6 and felt like i needed a size larger on the top and a size smaller on the bottom. having said that, the material is a very good qu",0
"I was really excited about this top since i have others from retailer that are similar in styling. unfortunately, it just didn't work out. i am petite with a short torso and ordered my usual size and it was way too short in the front. the top was also boxy and didn't sit right. it just wasn't flattering. cute top on the hanger, but just not on me.",0
"The back of this t-shirt looks cute but the front looks really weird. the material in the back is quite stiff but the grey material is soft, so the front gray area ends up hanging weirdly and looking uneven and messy. i appreciate asymmetrical clothing but to me it looked like a patched up rag from the front. it fits true to size.",0
"Well, this top just did not do anything for me - it's a very conservative style with the high neckline and blousy fit. you'd need to go a little lower in size if you want any of your figure to show through. i guess it might be good for a church function or some other conservative event, but it was too buttoned-up for my style. i also had a hard time getting it off even though the size i tried on was large for me. i didn't care for the feel of the fabric either, although the lace is nice.",0
Well made. made my hips looks giant. just not my style unfortunately. i'd have to work at preschool or on a ship to pull this off. i'm 5'3 120-123lbssize 6-8. i got the size 6 (not petite cuz they were sold out).,0
"I am 5'3"" 130 and curvy and this dress fit me perfectly. it's great for parties and weddings (depending on how formal). the only reason i gave it four stars is because the fabric is a little strange; the ribbing for the squares is almost like a pillowy fabric, and it feels a little bit on the cheaper side but luckily it doesn't look cheap. nonetheless, i love this dress and would definitely recommend!",1
"Love this dress! just wore it last night to an early valentine's dinner. very classy, simple, but gorgeous. i'm a size 2 in just about everything but i always buy a size 4 in retailer dresses because i'm tall (5'9"") and have broad shoulders and a long torso, and sizing up in dresses works better all around. i am also not busty (32b). i did get this in a 4. this dress was a little awkward at first trying to hook and then zip but once i got that down it worked. the hook is right up under your",1
"Very cute flowy fit. i am generally a size small, 32-d chest. because the material has no give it fits perfectly (just barely) if it was any smaller or i was any larger it would be too small. very cute design.",1
"My store had this and i was so intrigued with its nearly $400 price tag that i decided to play dress up. the colors in person match the colors online, so that was nice to see consistency. overall though, i feel like a dress of that price would need to make me feel like a million bucks, which it did not. most items that fit my slender frame are too short, and this was no exception. the xs fit but i wouldn't be doing much moving, walking or dancing in this dress, which brings me to the question of",0
This top has a western look with lots of black and some burgundy shades.  it is very cute and the fabric is soft.,1
"These run very small!! they are also short, almost like a crop pant. the fit was so weird that i won't even exchange for a bigger size.",0
"I just tried on this dress in the store, in red, and i loved the off the shoulder design. the color is just as pictured online (a light poppy red). the neckline began a few inches below my collarbone and was super flattering. however, the skirt portion of this dress flared awkwardly at the hips, causing my hips to look much wider than they really are (and also disturbing the otherwise clean lines of the dress). it seemed to me that there was too much fabric at the back portion of the skirt than",0
It looks like you are wearing cargo shorts. really unflattering. avoid buying this skirt,0
"I ordered a petite medium in black, and it fit great great. some of the other reviews said it was tight, but i found it pretty loose and flowy. also felt it was plenty of coverage - wore it to work (casual workplace) and transitioned to happy hour beautifully.",1
"I am pear-shaped and often have a hard time finding pants that fit just right. these did the trick!! they are slim in the waist, but have plenty of room for bigger hips. the overall fit is body skimming/hugging, but they are not tight or uncomfortable in any way! and i have no gapping at the waist. the fabric has a slight sheen to it and a little stretch, but they will be a perfect pant for the office. for reference, i am 5'4"", 34/26/38, and i got a 6 regular.",1
This jacket is well-made and smart looking. it gave me just the boost i needed today at a difficult meeting. thank you retailer!,1
"When i tried on this bathing suit, i decided to not try on any others. it was just right! i usually find bathing suit shopping difficult and no fun--as i can never find a suitable bathing suit. this suit looks nice/flattering, and i can also move around in it and it stays in place. i purchased it in the navy and i'm going to order it in another pattern as well. it looks modern and classic; it's a chic style. i'm a size 6 in dresses, and i purchased a size 10 in this bathing suit.",1
I have bought other leggings at retailer and they were fine. these run small. i have to return.,1
Love love love these leggings and what an amazing price point!!!,1
"The colors and fit of this suit are even better than described. it is the most comfortable and flattering one-piece i have ever tried on. 

as noted by other reviewers, there is limited support in the chest; this suit will keep you covered but does not provide lift.",1
"I love this top! i gave it a four star because i wish it were a tad longer. i am short... 5'-1 and it does work for me, but i do tend to like my tops longer. very cute and airy in the back!",1
"Cute top! the bright red crochet shoulders and back add the perfect pop of color to the light blue pinstriped front. it's a little loose and boxy around the bust area but overall i think it's a flattering shape. i got the regular s and don't find it too short. for reference i'm 5'2"", 134 lb, 34b. i often wear petite sizes but due to other reviews mentioning that the top is short i ordered the regular size and am happy with the length and fit.",1
This top looked super cute online but when it came it was super short and boxy. looked like a tent on me. this one went back the same day it came!,0
"Uncertain about sizing i got both the 4 & the 6...both made me look like a no-asser :( neither fit quite right in the leg. both hit at a weird point in my calf, not cute-short, just off. (i'm 5'8"" and 125#) to quote my husband, ""nope. not feeling these."" that said, they feel great on, seem to be made well, but are heading back to an retailer near you :( sigh. the quest continues :)",0
I love this dress for day and night time. the back detail is cute and works well with a racerback bra. it runs big though. i'm normally a small in dresses and the arm holes are too big in the size small on me. it was also generally too big all over. i like the length and the weight of the fabric. i purchased in the off black color.,1
"I love the fit of these pants -- they're the perfect slim black pants. however, i wore these pants exactly three times before the seams split the middle of the pant in not just one, but multiple places. disappointed by the workmanship/quality of the product, especially since the pants fit amazingly and don't sag like other slim fitting black pants tend to do. i hope retailer will take this into consideration and improve the quality of future iterations of this product.",0
I love these pants. i bought as basic pants to dress up or down and they look good with flats or heels. also i like you can wash instead of dry clean.,1
"This is an amazing swimsuit. i had been on the hunt for the perfect one piece. i wanted something a bit on the modest side, but still sexy, and i hoped for a unique print that would make it stand out. the icing on the cake would be a suit that is functional enough to either lay poolside or scuba dive. enter this swimsuit from retailer. i fell in love with the teal dot print as it's unlike anything else i've seen - it's absolutely spectacular in person. i love the vibrant blue and the chic d",1
"Like others, i finally received my size 6p black pants after months of waiting.  for starters, these pants run small, so i ordered a size up but still in petite, because i adored the red ones i got this past summer.  when the black pants arrived, they were a full three inches shorter than the red ones (which were also 6p), and the fabric did not feel anywhere close to the same quality.  i'm debating ordering the regular length, but i'm not sure i'll bother, based on some of the other reviews.",0
"So i recognized the fact that this dress was likely intended more for lounging than for wearing out and about, but i once had a lot of luck with dresses of this price point (and intent) at retailer, so i had hopes. i was just wanting it to be a great addition for vacations and beach days, but it's honestly so thin i couldn't even see it working that well for that. it's also cut smaller than i was anticipating judging by the way it fits the model; my usual small was way more bodycon than i was anti",0
"I don't normally try on tops like this but i liked the product shot so much that i wanted to repeat the outfit. i grabbed a large because it wasa shorter blouse. it was huge. i sized down to the medium and it was still loose but if i were to purchase, it would be that size. the red against the blue was very pretty but i didn't know if felt like a little kid in a uniform. the back did not lie flat, not sure if it was because of my 36d chest or because of the shirt design. it is well made and i th",1
"I think this is the first time i've successfully purchased pants online. i normally have to try a bunch of styles and sizes on before i find the right ones. i gave it a shot with these, and bingo! they are great! they are a bit longer on me than on the model, because i am 5'3"" and did not order a petite. i still like how they look, hitting just above my ankle. just the right blend of conservative and cool for lecturing in front of college undergrads.",1
"Received many compliments the first day i wore them.. amazing fit. disagree with the other post. the
quality is amazing. i wish they had other colors. bought xs",1
"This dress is the best casual find. goes with everything- flips flops, tennys, jean jacket. feels little sporty and the orange was a cool addition to my closet.",1
"I tried this on in the store and was disappointed because it looked so fresh and vibrant on the hanger. but it's basically cut for model-sized people only. it's short and wide, and if you have any boobs at all it'll make the back pucker. i can't imagine this will look good on most women.",0
"I really wanted this skirt to work but it didn't look very flattering on me. a great midi length and very cool pattern, so hopefully will work for others!",0
This top is gorgeous! this is why i love retailer the quality is amazing. i just love how unique this top is. it's a light jean blue and white pin striped shirt with these beautiful red crochet sleeves. i'm a 34ddd i ordered the large and it's perfect. it is a bit shorter probably because of my chest but i was going to wear it with high waisted shorts anyways.  it's a must buy!,1
"I am normally between a size 0 and 2, so i ordered these pants in both sizes to make sure i would have a nice pair of black crops to wear to work. the 0 seemed pretty tight all around, so i returned the 0 and kept the 2 even though there was a little bit of room in the waist. of course the size 2 after a few hours of wearing had completely stretched out, was bagging in the crotch area, sliding around on my waist and creasing badly behind the knees. i doubt i will wear these pants more than the o",0
"The material and construction of the pants are great, but the length is just plain awkward. i'm 5'4"" and the regular came to just above my ankles, and looked as though they had shrunk in the wash in a really bad way. a couple of inches longer and they would've been fine, or i could've gotten them in petite and worn them as true ankle-length pants, but the regular just didn't do it for me. also i'm usually a size 6 (5'4"", 125lbs) and these were a little baggy around the waist and hips.",0
"Unique design. love the collar and broad cuffs. the xs regular fits me better than the s petite, which is a bit short.",1
"This dress is gorgeous, but i should warn all the tall ladies out there that it fits quite awkwardly. i'm 5'10"" and tried both the petite (thinking it would fall more like a midi), and the regular, hoping it would fit like a maxi should. both hit at a very awkward spot on my mid-shin... as much as i loved and wanted it, it looked too weird to justify buying.",1
"Love the coral color - so pretty in person. it is slightly lower cut on the chest than i expected. 
this is a great top for the weekends!",1
This cardigan is very cute in the picture and i really wanted to love it but it just didn't seem worth the price. the material is kind of itchy to me and i wasn't a huge fan of the wide edges in the front. the colour is very nice and feminine.,0
"I don't typically write bad reviews, but this dress is so bad and i want to save someone else from buying it. i read the mostly bad reviews and still purchased anyway (my fault i know). the dress is super stiff ( i know denim can be that way and it is possible it would soften up after a few washes). i'm typically a 6/8 and the size small swallowed me, and the xs was big everywhere except through the bust (i ordered both sizes to try). i wouldn't recommend buying this if you are a size 8 or small",0
"These pants! great casual pants, i've received so many compliments! mainly because they are flowy, and the open panels make them different! with the weather so hot, they are perfect for keeping you cool. very pleased with this purchase!",1
"After reviewing the comments for this dress i was really hesitant about buying it online, so i finally went to the store and all of the reviews are 100% true. this dress is amazing in terms of quality, but the sizing makes zero sense. i'm normally a size 12, but based on the reviews i initially tried on a medium. even that was huge, arm holes so long you could see my entire bra. so i tried on the small and that fit perfectly. unfortunately, unless you're normally an 8(maybe) or above in sizing,",1
"Loved the style, ordered my normal m- fit tts though i thought i would potentially taper the sides to make less boxy (with a larger bust and shoulders, boxiness is unflattering). the slight boxiness looked perfect with stretchy, fitted business slacks. midday, i held my ipad up to my chest and the velcro from the cover pulled an entire lychnis delicate threads. not just snagged- i had to gently separate the threads from velcro grip. needless to say, it pulled the threads out by at least 1/2 an i",0
Nice basic top...i will get plenty of use out of this! love the neckline.,1
"I'd been eyeing this dress since i first saw it in the dress catalog when it came out. when i saw it in person, it was just as beautiful as i remembered! i'm about 140 lbs and usually wear a size s or m, but i tried the s on and decided to size down to an xs, because the linen flowy fabric lays a bit wide when on the body; however, the s would have worked, too! i'd say size down if you prefer your clothes a tiny bit more fitted. the fabric is beautiful and lightweight, even though there is more",1
Don't buy this dress unless you are normally a medium or larger. order it one or two sizes smaller than your normal size. i ordered an xs and it's more like a medium or large.,0
I ordered the white solid & the white w/blue stripes versions in size xl. both fit me true to size. the fit matches the model's photos. i got these on sale and they're worth that price. they're great basics to have. the white/blue striped one is my favorite. it such a pretty combo. i love the unique neckline too. fun details for a basic tee.,1
"The colors and print are absolutely beautiful and i'm quite heartbroken that this suit just doesn't fit. i don't have a long torso but the v was just so plunging that i wouldn't feel comfortable leaving the backyard lounge chair in this bathing suit. no matter how much i tied the halter it still revealed a v halfway down to my naval. the strange thing is that there seemed to be too much fabric on top, lots of ruching and thicker straps than i would normally go for, and while i'm only around a b",0
"The overall styling was great, and the dress is super-cute, if a little thick (it's made of denim, after all). i ordered a size down from my normal, and even then, i was swimming in it. the worst part, and the aspect that will make me return it, is that the arm holes hang down so low that i'd have to wear a tank top under the dress. i'm returning it, though it is really cute and i love this brand. the arm holes killed it for me.",0
"It is seldom that i write a review about a tee, but after receiving the jessa tee in the mail today, i just felt compelled to do so! the deal is, this tee is pricey for sure, but in my opinion, it is worth it! as another reviewer said, the cotton fabric is hefty; in fact, it could also be called a ""lightweight sweater."" everything about this tee is perfect and classic: the elbow sleeves, the nice neckline, and the semi-boxy, semi-cropped fit. it will go with everything from jeans, to nice slacks",1
"I'm a 110 lb, shorty with a short torso and long arms so the standard xs was huge. i had the opportunity to try on both the xxs petite and xs petite. the xxs petite was almost perfect but i wanted it more flowy - probably best for those that are even shorter and more lightweight than me, othewise, it looks a little too boxy. the petite xs fit me the best and draped nicely, similar to the model in the pink. i had a sweater with this exact silhouette 5+ years ago and wore it to death even though i",1
"I bought it in the cream color and loved it so much that i bought it in black too. super cute with jeans! can dress it up too. the only slight negative, if i had to find one, is that i feel like i have to pull it forward, at the neckline every once in a while...it doesn't choke me but just feels like it's heavier in the back so pulls a bit. worth it though! :)",1
"This is a perfect saturday t shirt for the colder days. great fit; not form fitting with no elastic or rayon, soft cotton with great details. im 5'8 140 ish and the medium fit great. i bought a washed denimy blue in the store but may be coming back for more colors now! the white was to sheer for my taste though",1
"I can never resist a peter pan collar, so i bought this top in the ivory. it's so cute! i wore it for the first time today and received many compliments. it's very comfortable, fits well, and looks expensive. highly recommend it!",1
"This is absolutely adorable and so flattering! i have the patterned shirt, and i just purchased the white one and the orange one because i like it so much. i am 5 ft. 9"" and 155 lbs. and the medium fits nicely. hope this helps!",1
"I wanted to love this dress. the colors are heavenly and it looks light and airy. it isn't, it is very heavy, much too heavy for florida heat. the top layer is a beautiful sand color and while the fabric is nice, the heaviness of the top really weighs the whole dress down. i felt like it added ten pounds to my appearance, easily. back it went, boo hoo. if you are between sizes, i would size down, runs a bit big.",0
"I think in general it is just hard to buy a bathing suit online, but i really underestimated the v-neck of this suit. i read the reviews and noted it was not recommended for girls with larger size breast. as i'm basically an a cup, i figured i would be fine. the top portion basically has no coverage or hold. even when tied very tight, the top still opened making me feel exposed and like my entire breast would fall out of the suit. needless to say my fiancã© was not a fan of the suit either. even",0
I love this cardigan! i ordered the pink and it's a really pretty color. i wish it didn't run so big but xs will be cozy all winter.,1
"Very soft and comfy tee. like the interesting neckline. wish the petite neckline was slightly higher, but sleeves are right length and have great cuffs.",1
"Love the color, but the fit is just odd and frumpy. the sleeves are shorter than the should be. when i lift my arms, the entire sweater gets lifted. going back.",0
"Yikes!  quite a smell off of this one- like wet/hot wool.  the color was beautiful, but the sweater is enormous!  strange fit under the arms as well.  this one went back the same day.",0
"This top has a comfy cozy feel while still being flattering. i especially like the generous neckline--adds a uniqueness to it. great shirt for dressing down, but still feeling feminine. i bought two! my husband always compliments me when i wear it.",1
"I had tried this on in the beige & loved it but could not find it in my size so i got it in the pink.
did not look at good as the beige.",0
"I love retailer and fell in love as soon as i saw this dress online. being 5'10"" i love a quality maxi dress and this one did not disappoint. however, being 5'10"" also means the top sweater overlay hits me way short. it looks ridiculous. i also thought that this was very heavy for a maxi dress and could not imagine wearing it in 80 degree weather. unfortunately after waiting so long for it's arrival this is going back.",0
"I wasn't going to purchase this dress because it was given 1 star. however, i ordered it and i was so glad i did!!! i'm 5'1, 105lbs this dress fit me perfectly, it really compliment my petite body. i get so much compliments! it is not easy to order anything for a petite frame but this dress really show off my body without showing too much.",1
I tried this on in the store and had to have it. this is the kind of sweater that you just want to cozy up with on a nice fall or winter day with a cup of coffee in hand. i love the neutral pink color as it will go with everything. i'm a dress and skirt girl and this will go well with those items. it will cover your bum and i love the dolman sleeves. i highly recommend it!!,1
"The sweater is cute, but scratchy.",0
It was cute. i didn't keep it because it wasn't soft and hung a bit different than pictured. i thought it would be softer material. it was itchy,0
"I was so in love with this dress when i saw it in the store but so disappointed when i put it on. i am 5'10"" with curves and usually buy a large in dresses. this dress looked like a sack on me. the top was way too big and loose making the dress a boxy cut rather than a maxi cut like i was expecting. the dress is lovely to look at on the hanger and feels good on but i don't think it flatters hourglass figures. it was the right length for me unlike many other reviewers. 
obviously, based off the",0

The fit is not as shown on the website. will be returning.,0
"The detail on this dress is lovely -- it's unusual and well-made from soft fabric. it is big though -- i would usually wear a medium and ordered a petite small. to give you a sense of how large it is, i am currently 33 weeks pregnant, and bought this to wear after the pregnancy. i can actually get it on now, over the considerable baby bump. it doesn't look good, but i can in fact get it on. hoping it won't be way too large post-pregnancy, but it seems to fit fine in the shoulders now. definitely",1
"I am floored by the amount of positive reviews on this dress! when i received it, it looked nothing like it does on the model. the bottom looked like dirty sand and was completely wrinkled. if you have anything above a c cup, the top looks completely unflattering. i looked so top heavy in this dress! definitely not worth the price. so disappointed.",0
"This didn't work for me. im normally a m (8/10). got this in xs. that was the correct size for me, i believe. however, the armholes were huge. husband said the top of the dress looked like the autobots symbol from transformers and he wanted me to keep it. but, i sent it back.",0
"I just received this in the mail today. first of all there was no slip included and the fabric is totally sheer. the description says ""viscose lining"" so i assume there was a slip and from the picture it looks like it was a beige color. second of all, it was obviously sent from a store where they lost the slip and it was squished into the smallest possible retailer envelope. the fabric is beautiful but the dress is humongous like the previous reviewers said. i ordered a size smaller than us",0
I am six feet tall so this will definitely be a tunic with jeans or leggings but if you are shorter it could easily be a dress. lovely pattern with soft cozy fabric. nice weight and hangs well. definitely a keeper!,1
"I was so excited to order this sweater but was so disappointed when it came. the knit is somewhat stiff and the sleeves are not as bell shaped as pictured on the model. overall i would of kept it if it were much less money, for the price it is just an ordinary sweater with no style.",0
"After reading the reviews i decided to give this a try, but it just didn't work on me. i'm 5'8, smaller on top, and usually wear m in retailer sizes. this was ok in the shoulder and arm area but a little too snug for me in the hips. also, the diagonal striping made my boobs disappear and the pattern at the bottom emphasized my tummy and rear. not exactly the look i was going for. back it goes.",0
"I loved this in the store, but had to order my size. it is true to size - a great length - but the material is very thin and very sheer. i don't think it will carry over into fall - it is more of a summer weight fabric. it is also a little pricey for that same reason - still - its a great basic and i will keep my eye out for it to go on sale.",1
"I absolutely love this sweater! first of all, it's extremely comfortable. i have been wearing it around the house all day and have no desire to take it off. it's cute as a casual around the house top, but also adorable dressed up with jeans and boots. it drapes beautifully for an effortless chic look. the color is pretty close to the photo and very nice in person. the possibilities are endless for colors to accessorize and match with. this sweater is definitely cropped in length, which i normall",1

"This is a beautiful tunic. i wanted it to work so much but i couldn't get past the itch factor. also, the sleeves were shorter than i expected. when i wore a light tee underneath, it didn't move well and looked bulky so sadly it went back to the store. if the material doesn't bother you, buy this. would look great w/ tights/leggings and boots.",1
"This sweater was a big let down. i am 5'2"" so i ordered it in a petite. it was so short that if i lifted my arms, you'd see my bra!! there is no way i could wear it without something under it- even with high waisted bottoms. and the bell sleeves look nothing like the pic. the entire sleeve is just wide, and it continues with little increase into the cuff. it is just short and boxy. it is going back for sure.",0
"I was excited to see this top in person, but once i got a close up look at it (and also tried it on) i was disappointed. first, the color is much more persimmon orangey in person and that's a hard color to pull off for a lot of people. it just pulls any pink or red in your skin and highlights it. 

second, the top was poorly finished. i had to pick up two to try on because the lace was wonky across the front of the first one i grabbed. so much so that the lace was puckered because it had been",0

"I fell in love with this top when i tried it on at the store. it's a great fall piece. it is see-through around the bust, so a nude bra or any color camisole would have to be worn. my only thing is that it seems a little dressy, so i'm wondering how much i'll wear it. i work from home so everything has to be somewhat casual. so, i do recommend it, but i'm undecided as to if i'm going to keep it. for reference, i'm a 34d with a thin upper body and took a size medium.",1
Great tank to wear to work or a night out. fits true to size.,1
"As others have said, this is even prettier in person. beautifully made, colors are really pretty. it's unique and special. in sweaters i go between sizes small and medium, depending on the cut. i went with the small here because the medium had a bit too much fabric around the hips where i don't need it. it doesn't run large, it's just that i wanted it to be closer fit as i'll wear it with skinny jeans or leggings.",1
"I wanted to love this. however, the fit was funky and the colors were muted. this is definitely something you must try on in the store. too risky to buy online due to weird fit.",0
"Ladies this top shrinks!!! i am very disappointed, i was in love with this top and the first time i washed it it shrunk a significant amount. i did not use a dryer, i laid this piece out to dry as i do with the majority of my knit tops and it shrunk. it is a lot shorter and much tighter, especially in my arms. if you love this top i might suggest buying a size up and washing it to fit.",0

a nice addition to your fall/ winter wardrobe.

so happy with this beautiful black dress!!!",1
"New fav lbd. i am 5 months postpartum and this dress makes me feel like my old self again. it fits right above the waist, with a bow to cinch the waist. love the fit and flare. the top is warm, great for a cold evening out. and the taffeta really dresses it up. love",1
"This sweater looks soft and flowy on the model, but in the store it is rather stiff lace in the back and very plain in the front. i did not like the ribbing on the front bottom of the sweater because it pulled in places and didn't lie flat. way too expensive for what you are getting.",0
"Again, bought this while wearing my retailer colored glasses. i loved the flowiness and color of the dark pink, and was convinced in the dressing room that this top made me look like a chic goddess, mid-vacation on the amalfi coast. i tried it on at home, and it straight up looked like i was wearing a maternity top. since i'm not with child, this one's going back!",0
I love the back detail but doesn't feel that comfortable on. i bought in green. it's fitted so get size larger if you plan to layer up. i'm 107 and bought xs size. i should have ordered the s.,0
I was on the fence about this jumpsuit at first.  i feel the pockets in the back are a little high on my bum.  kind of an unnatural placement.  i sized up so it wasn't so tight fitting at the waist and hips so it made the placement of the back pockets a little better.,1
"This shirt is not a good look for a gal with hips. the fit at the top is tight (i ordered a small) but there is so much material at the bottom and if you are a little taller (i am 5'7), it hits at a place that is not flattering. i was hoping for something that hung straight down and would be good with leggings. this is not it...also the material is a little stiffer then i was expecting.",0
Way to v necked- other than that would be a nice go to top. needs a cami.,1
After seeing this on anthto's facebook page i was so excited to order. i ended up going to a store and trying on. i couldn't believe it was the same shirts when i first saw it. i thought this ran quite big. and the shape was odd. lots of material in the middle. i am a mom of 3 young kids and didn't want people to think #4 was on the way.,0
"I ordered this sweater in black and thought it was a pretty design and something different in a cardigan. when i tried it on, it was an odd fit and very boxy and unflattering. i wanted to like it and keep it, but i knew i would not wear it so, unfortunately, it went back.",0
I ordered the pink in size xl. the color was pretty. the problem is the material was too thin and tight. it ran at least a size smaller than shown in the photos online.,0
"This is a very pretty sweater, a bit boxy and short but cute. i am 5'1"" and ordered the regular xs in black. the thing i did not like about this sweater was the gold thread through the back lace. i would have kept this if it was plain black lace. just did not like that look.",0
"I was obsessed with this dress from the moment i saw it online and was so excited to buy it for my company christmas party. i'm 5'4"", 36c, 145lbs and i ordered a 6. the size was great but the whole cut of the dress was completely off for me. i have a fairly short torso but the top portion of the dress (which is a sweater-like material) hit me far too low on my waist to be flattering; the petite may have fixed it, but then the skirt would've been too short. the pleats were cute but flared out too",1
Cute cute. simple tank with a little something to add interest.,1
"This sweater is a cute design but did not work for me. i am 5'9"" and this is way to short/cropped and looks awkward. the quality was so so, it looked stretched out in the front. it's getting returned.",0
"Beautiful top, loved the color but shoulders were totally messed up and not sure if it was from
hanging at store or the way it was sewn.",0
"I ordered this in two colors, in my regular size. i washed and laid flat to dry....it shrunk like crazy. i held the one i washed up to the other unworn/unwashed one and it was at least two inches shorter. they may both be going back. i am so sad.",0
I purchased this top in blue and liked it so i ordered the red color. i hated the way the second one fit. i'm concerned the blue will not wear well after seeing the way the second one looked!,0
"This cardigan is nice and the lace at the back is pretty. just be aware that it's definitely a cropped length, which is good for wearing over a dress that you don't want to cover up too much. size up if you want room to layer. the one i tried on at the store had the top button almost falling off, so i didn't buy it.",1
"You guys, i love this so much! however, within one hour of wearing it, the back seam completely ripped. it fit me perfectly... sadly i&#39;ll have to return the damaged item. really sad it&#39;s all sold out too!",0
Unusual color. expensive even on sale.,1
"Oh elevenses, i love your pants..the fabrics, the details, the length. i've found elevenses to be classic work pants. reliable, professional, well made. these are none of those things. the cardinal trousers are thin and the rise feels much higher that's it appears in the picture. the red pair are thin, stretchy and cheap. both pairs have to go back. i'm truly sad.",0
The lokka tunic is a perfect go-to top for casual days or nights! pair it with skinny jeans or leggings and you are set! the long sleeves are fitted and long-so they can be bunched at the wrist. i ordered it in both the black and the the pale grey/blue shade. it is a winner.,1
"I got two of these when they went on sale because i hate paying $68 for a basic top like this.. but for the sale price they are great! comfortable, lightweight, and flattering. the black is a little sheer, but nothing a tank underneath can't solve. a good buy!",1
"I bought this in my usual medium and it fits great (fitted at the shoulder, loose below). it looks great with skinny jeans and can be worn casually or dressed up with accessories.",1
"Love the design and the gold color, but the seams between knit and lace were a little weird and bunched/weren't smooth. maybe the one i tried on just needed to be ironed or something...",0
"The fabric is beautiful, even the lining is lovely. i ordered the green color in a large, as i'm curvy and have long arms. but it just doesn't lay correctly at all - the collar has no structure, even though it's a lapel, and the side vents just pop out - the jacket added about 10lbs, and just looked frumpy. it looks much more tailored on the model. too bad, as i have been looking for a velvet blazer in the color for a long time.",1
"I loved the cut of these pants and the button accent on the pockets. however, the material was quite thin and the quality was not great- there were multiple snags along the seams. additionally, at 5'8, 130lbs i was swimming in the size 4. i would have tried sizing down if the quality was better.",0
"Why is it so difficult to find a shirt that doesn't expose half of my bra if i lift my arm? 

this is cute (beyond the arm hole issue) but overpriced. going back.",0
"I wanted these culottes to work so much! the fabric is gorgeous, but the size i ordered didn't fit. i'm normally a size 28 in pants, and i ordered a size 8. it was way too tight and made me look like i had a pooch in the zipper area. not what i wanted it to be. had to return them unfortunately.",0
Quality is fantastic but i feel like a 14 would have barely made it's way around one leg! this pant is way small in terms of sizing and not a style fit for anyone over a 6. a lot of fabric in the legs. nice pant but not for this girl!,0
"Skirt in med fit fine, cute,lightweight, swingy, flirty, fun, almost knee length
i am typically a 10-12
but the pattern which swings up, across, and down made me look wide in the hips as opposed to other clothes i own already
more petite, less curvy girls enjoy!
its going back,sorry!",1
"Got the small petite. length is perfect, love the color, super comfy, very pretty. the problem is that you cannot wear a bra because under the armpits is so low that either shows your bra (a lot) or if u wear sans bra you may show your breasts (it's loose all around on top, so very easy to show everything. if i adjust the straps it works but then the waist goes up and it looks like i have a belly. i'm taking to a seamstress to see if she can take in under armpits, if not it's going back. i'm 5',",0
"These run small (i am 110 and got a size 4), they were a tad tight on top. the waist fit but felt a little too snug, short from waist to crotch and then bloomed out in a nice but stiff ish material. they are a dark blue animal print. i felt like bozo the clown goes to the jungle. they looked so silly i had to laugh. even with the 20% off, these are going back. not even comfortable to lounge around the house in never mind being seen by anyone in person!",0
"I loved the photo of this dress. upon examination of the dress (and trying it on) after receiving in the mail, the dress shown online is nothing like the dress i received save for the pattern. the dress i received has a side zip as well as a belt and no pleats on the top. the bottom is also cut straight across not as it appears in the photo. turns out it is not as flattering as it should appear.",0
"I ordered these in my usual pilcro petite size 6. they were impossible to button, which is interesting 'cause i also ordered the pilcro wide leg chinos in the same size and they fit perfectly, as usual. but it ended up being ok because i don't care for the speckled, slightly rough material or the contrasting piping. back they go!",0
"I was excited to see these jeans since they came in petite sizes and had a short inseam... unfortunately after ordering/returning several pairs, i found out that these are actually not petite jeans. please beware that if you are ordering these for the shorter inseam, they are actually 28 in... not 24 in as in the description. other than the inseam issues, they fit like typical paige denim.",0
"This top is super cute, however the bottom hem is all frayed....couldn't really tell that from the pictures. the ""flutter"" sleeves are too big...looks funny with the fraying...runs a little large as well. loved the color! perfect with white denim!",0
"I was looking for a shirt of this style. i thought it was very cute, but it is not ""red' as advertised. it is really a brick orange-y color, which is definitely not what i wanted. very disappointed. sent it right back.",0
This is a great skirt that could be worn to a wedding or worn more casually with a cool tshirt. it is not too puffy and the inner skirt is stretchy and more fitted. i had to size 1 size down. really nice.,1
"These pants are perfect!!! they are exactly what i was looking for, and worth every penny! the fabric is more lightweight than any other sort of denim, but still i think i could wear these any season. they look so cute with simple heels and a classic blouse, but they can be dressed down with nice sneakers and a plain white t! so excited to have these in my closet!! love a good pair of fun pants.",1
Too big and it's not secure enough to wear for swimming.,0
"I received this skirt today and was very disappointed. i don't know what i expected but it is not as i thought. even though the quality is very good and the fit is true to size, i may return it. the fabric of the skirt is just too busy, at least for me. i am just uncertain and even though i have many tops, the colors are just not matching. white looks better than any colored top with this particular print. i am going to try it on one more time and make a definite decision.",0
"This top will be perfect for autumn and even winter down in the southeast. i purchased the ""red"" and hoped that it was more of a rust color-lucked in! the material is very soft and more on the thinner side for layering-which is alway a plus. i have spare tires in my belly area and this does not grab aholed of them,in fact the stripes do the work and disguise! and the lace up nautical feel brings the attention to my money maker! you won't be disappointed",1
"I ordered this on a whim during retailer days sale and i'm glad i did. it's now one of those shirts that calls my name every morning. i've worn it with denim skinnies and a knee length black knit pencil skirt. so soft and flattering. i got it in the red, but am tempted by the blue!",1
"I ordered this skirt online in a size 8 but returned for a 10 so it could sit a bit lower.

the fabric is so beautiful and a bit heavier so it can be worn all year long.
so glad i made this purchase.",1
"The wide leg was fun, not too wide, but the long pocket seem to shorten leg so i returned. great for a taller person. bottom & trim cute",1
"I got this skirt in the dove grey, which is a lovely shade of light grey and silver. it has one layer underneath that is a sparkly silver netting which is really pretty that you can't see in the photo. the other layer is the grey netting. it has a very soft light grey silky cotton liner. i got the petite xs and it fits just as it should. i'm 5'3, 102. the skirt looks just as it is pictured, i think it can be dressy or dressed down a bit. very very pretty and well made. i'm happy with the purchas",1
"Layered this with a chunky sweater and a pair of kicks. it can be low key or dressed up with a pair of heels, multi-functionality not just occasional. it&#39;s feminine, funky, and fabulous!! i bought the last one in the store!",1
"I saw this skirt online and went to the store immediately to try on. i was a bit disappointed. the size is tts but the prints were prettier online. the material is ok. the regular is long so probably won't look good on a shorter person
if it is still available when the price comes down, i might buy it.",0
An interesting design in a high-quality garment.  fits true to size on me and is great for layering.  very soft knit with the drapey attachment and a collar you can adjust to look the way you want. i feel lucky that i got this on sale but i would've gladly paid full price since this is a three season piece.,1
I found these to fit odd. i am also use to wearing the skinny jeans so trying a wide leg was a bit weird anyway. the placement of the pockets and the way it hit my waist was awkward and not flattering. i am usually a 8/10 and the 8 fit but just did not look good.,0
"I loved this dress and it fit great on me: 5'7, 115 lbs, wore an xs. it was a little tighter than i wish, but the s would have been too loose. unfortunately, when i received the dress the arms were already pilling. it is made of a mix of polyester, and while it's machine washable (yay), i can imagine this dress would be pilling very easily, and i wish the fabric was a higher quality for the price, so i returned it.",0
"I'm in love, i'm in love.

this dress was gifted to me, because i was gawking at it so often. i love it!!! i am petite, 5'3"" 118 pounds and i could do either the small or extra small. the small was a little more comfortable, because the extra small was a bit tight in the arms-but i went with the extra small anyway. in both cases the neckline showed a small amount of tasteful cleavage and i felt like a model with how many people complimented me on it. many people even took the extra step in compl",1
The dress arrived with a few snags and the fabric already pilling. the fabric will only get worse with wear. return. cute concept; poor fabric quality.,0
I love the design and pattern of this top. it runs big so an xs was roomy on me but still cute. the neck is wide. i returned it bc the material of the top isn't for me. the texture is too soft.,0
"I was so excited when this dress went on sale.  it is very soft and the print is so distinctive.  it is super comfy but not slimming or flattering at all.  i am a curvy girl,  wear a medium 8/10 and this made me look so wide!  the skirt is quit full,  a small would have fit but the top was tight.  so disappointing.",0
This top is stunning. the colors are vivid and it is extremely cozy and soft. however it seems delicate and would need to only be worn once in a while. it is not an everyday top. the material has a cotton candy like appearance. it really is unique and one of a kind.,1
"After reading the reviews i placed an order because it was the only top that caught my eye on the entire price downs. lately all my usual l/10 sizes from retailer turn out huge so i ordered a size smaller from what i usually wear. all would have been ok if the top wasn't so darn short. for reference i'm 6 ft tall, 160 lb. it's weird that this top looks completely the opposite of the model on the photo, from a loose looking fit with longer sleeves looking like a stylized sweatshirt that is not what",0
"Another great dress by retailer. i've worn it with tall boots with heels, riding boots and booties...all look really good. i've also added a cream/beige cardigan and even a fuzzy/furry vest. very versatile. the only few things that i would have liked even more is that design of the dress be actual stitching and not just a flat print and also the material does shrink a tat when you wash it. it's a staple and keeper.",1
"Love this! easy to dress up and down, has a great length on the torso but the sleeves are about 2-3 inches from my wrist bone, i see why the model has them pushed/rolled up- which is how i wear the shirt now too. but then it's hard to layer under a coat.",1
"5'1'' 43-31-43. i really wanted to love this coat: the material is nice, the green color is dark and rich, it has a hood. however, the cut is bad for me (and probably a lot of other people). the shoulders were cut too wide and impeded movement, and the bust and hips were cut too tight, overall it was just boxy. i have another boiled wool coat that i bought at retailer about 7 years ago and though it's cut oversize like this one, it has a much fuller sweep, so the proportions still seem right. also",0
"I originally got these in a 29 petite and thought they fit great right out of the bag (i'm usually a 6/8).. and within an hour of wearing them (to retailer, actually), the knees had gotten so baggy that they looked absolutely ridiculous; i've never had jeans do this. the salesperson at retailer agreed that they seemed very odd. i exchanged for a 28p at her suggestion, and i just hate them. i'd say the smaller size seems every so slightly small, but nothing major - but the waist actually folds over a",0
"I love this as a lounge-at-home top. the colors and pattern are really pretty, it's soft and warm. very comfy and cozy. but it's also boxy and thick so not a flattering cut.",1
"This skirt is not what i was expecting at all. for starters it runs large, i expected it to sit at the natural waist and it is definitely made to do so, but it was a good two inches too big and therefore wouldn't lay flat and gaped at the front. no bueno. my biggest gripe, though, is that the color looks nothing like it does in the picture. they have it paired with an ivory top and the two look like they match so well but do not be fooled, the background color of this skirt is not even close to",0
"I wanted to love these pants, but they were larger than i expected and the fabric is very heavy. almost like a thick sweater.",0
"This dress has a beautiful fit; eyed it for awhile--snatched it up at the dress sale! only drawback was the edging around the neck; on some, the cream-patterned fabric was used and it was distracting. hunted around at stores, but ended up getting lucky with online purchase.",1
Very cheap looking material. looks cheap to cost $158.,0
"What a well-designed dress! the cut is a slight a-line without adding bulk and the pattern is very slimming. the lining makes this a pretty good option for cooler weather. the neck is pretty wide, as others have noted, but i find that a heavy cream colored scarf is a pretty good accent. it does run a little large. i'm 5'5""/130lbs and went with the xsp.",1
I was initially attracted to the colors,1
This is way cuter in person than on model. it is a super soft and fluffy sweater. the colors are so pretty and feminine. i received it as a christmas gift and have already worn it twice. it's perfect with skinny jeans and ugg boots. i vary between xs and small in retailer sweaters. this is a bit boxy so i sized down with the xs and it fits perfect!,1
"The colors in this dress are much less vibrant in person. the scoop of the neckline is very wide and deep. i know others have posted that this is a great dress for work, but not in my workplace.",0
"I adore this sweater coat! i first bought the green color in my normal size online on a whim mostly due to the positive reviews. i was not disappointed at all! this sweater coat is soft boiled wool.. the green color is a deep forest that looks incredible with black, grays and berry colors.

the fit appears to be magical. it manages to be both roomy and figure flattering, which is tricky with my figure (hourglass). i tend to need a defined waist, but somehow this coat manages to be very slimming",1
"This sweater dress is lovely, quirky and comfortable. because i have broader shoulders, the neckline was perfect on me, although i probably will end up wearing a scarf to keep my neck warm! the dress skims in a very flattering way. at first i was dissapointed it wasn't more formfitting, but it drapes very nicely. (i usually wear a size four in dresses and chose the small in this dress which was best i think.) it has a built in slip that is a bit flimsy, so i will probably wear a long silk one th",1
Cute and comfortable! i loved the colors and how soft the shirt is!,1
"I ordered this coat in the ""pink"" color. actually, it is a coal color (papaya) and will be wonderful with gray, black, khaki, and great with animal print accessories. the fit is just as it looks online, no surprises. this coat is attractive buttoned or unbuttoned. the collar is just as attractive buttoned as unbuttoned. the boiled wool is light weight and has some stretch to it. (much softer than the boiled wool geiger jackets, for anyone who remembers them)

one concern: since the wool is light",1
"I really like the sundry brand. however. this is thin and to me out of character for an retailer tee. it look adorable in picture. however the coloring is way off. the navy is almost black it's so dark and the kaki stripe is a green. it's nothing like i had hoped it would be. fabric in very thin and more like a pajama top. so disappointed. it will go back. i do not make it a habit to bash a product. however with tax, shipping and 83.00 price tag. 103.11 is absolutely terrible.",0
"This is a comfortable sweater dress, and the quality of the material seems good. the solid blue strip down the front makes it look very bland. i think it would need some dressing up with a necklace or scarf. i decided to pass.",0
"I ordered this in the orange color from online. they were sold out of petite so i ordered medium (regular). i liked it, but just not flattering. i am 5'2"" and the coat was too big. sleeves were past my hands. i think because i'm ""curvy"" the straight cut of coat would not have looked good on me in a size small. it was a nice coat, just not for me.",0
"Received these as a christmas gift from my daughter. just wonderful - warm and cozy and cute. size m is just a tad baggy; i'm sure i could have worn small, but no matter. i wear these often and love them! such a treat!",1
"Every year around this time, our beloved retailer comes out with a wool sweater coat. i've seen every style over the last five years and this year they have outdone themselves!!! this coat is a dream. not too thin and not too thick...it's the perfect layering piece. the fabric has perfect stretch in it. the colors are lovely (i ended up with the cream color, but i loved the green too!!) in many sweater coats i prefer an xl, but because of the stretch the l was just perfect. i'm 5'8 and it hits wel",1
"Im 5'1"" and about 110lbs. ordered the small because i do have some curves- it was huge- more like a large and didnt have much structure at all. the wool was very soft and stretchy. and like others have said- kinda orange- not true coral color. it fit me like a throw blanket- its going back for sure. might purchase again if the petite xs is back in stock and on sale- this should def be under $100.",0
"I have this wonderful sweater coat in three sizes (s,sp,m) in the coral, green",1
"I coveted this item since i first saw it on instagram. i finally bought it in coral. it's a beautiful coat, the color is lovely and i like the way the hood makes a cute collar when worn down. the only problem is it looks like a bathrobe on me. i am 5'5"" and wear a size 8. i bought a medium, worried a small would not button. the sleeves are far too long. i do not want to go through the trouble of returning, so gave it to my daughter who is four inches taller. it looks cute in her.",1
I bought it to mainly wear as a coat but i think it'd be great with some leggings and boots as well. if you want a more structured look go a size smaller. i plan on wearing this more as outer wear so i went with large. the coral is beautiful,1
"This tunic is very nice. flattering, good design, worn in winter and spring, and fits well. i have a curvy figure, and this fits well. i wish it came in more colors.it does show flaws slightly but fits well and is stretchy.",1
"The top i received was large, really long in length, pockets in the front along the seam, and lots of volume in the back without any princess seams to give it shape. the id #'s matched, but that's about it. returned!",0
"So when i saw a sweater with a big llama face on the front of it, i knew it must be mine. i ordered it and eagerly awaited its arrival. while the llama print and color of the sweater are ah-mazing, the fit of the sweater leaves something to be desired. i'm a 36 dd and mostly a size l, so that's what i ordered. it wasn't snug, but it didn't have the cut to pull off the oversized drapey look, so the areas where it was loose looked...strange. the sleeves were really long too, but i could have rolle",1
"This top is full of amazing details. the photos really don't do it justice. it is very flowy and does run large but is so pretty and soft and in beautiful shades of blue. i bought a small and it is fairly long in back on my 5'5"" frame but because of the detailing...it just works.",1
"Unlike the first three reviews, i loved this sweater. the colors were beautiful and i paired it with green cords. i did not find the sweater to be itchy but very comfortable. fits trus to size.",1
"I love this sweater.  i am 5' 1"" and tried on the petite in the store but ended up going with the regular size as i preferred the length.  the overall fit was the same.  i bought the blue which to me is the colour shown here, more a grey and purplish colour, beautiful for fall and much nicer than a straight blue.  i have worn it to work several times and always get a compliment.  this sweater is nice for all ages, it is soft, comfortable and versatile.  it might just be my go to fall sweater.",1
"I ordered this in a small petite and medium petite , and i am a huge fan of a*k. i put tried on the sp. while it fit, it was very long, even for a petite. what i hated about it was that the piping on the top made me look very wide. even a long necklace wouldn't help deter the look. on a positive side, the blue was a very nice, cool color. i am usually a small to medium in a*k (6-8 in tops) and the small fit well in the arms/bodice, just too much fabric for me. returning!",0
I have the blue color of this top and i love the color variation throughout. it looks very unique and it is going to be a great piece for late summer/early fall. the pleated look on the upper chest is very flattering and adds texture to the top. i am pleased with my purchase!,1
"My perspective is as a sewer so i'm more picky perhaps. this top is poorly made. the fabric pattern is crooked or not consistent in each piece. sewers do this to save $ - squeezing the pieces on the fabric. it looks sloppy. the cut is very full; the bottom edge measures 104"" around. for my figure, curvey, at 5'6"" and 150lbs, this top is not flattering it looks maternity. perhaps best on a slim figure and with leggings.",0
"I got the pink version to layer with spring clothes. i always wear a medium, but sized down to a small based on the other review. the seams are very flattering. the material is very soft. on sale, the price is reasonable.",1
"I love this tee but there is a lot of swing/ fabric so it can tend to make you look wide. also, i have a short torso to begin with but this tee is on the short side. i'm still undecided on whether i'm going to keep it b/c it's rayon/ poly and it's hand wash only. and i'm worried that one wash will make it shrink in length and it's already short. rayon knits have a tendency to shrink in length when washed so beware!",1
"This top reminded me of a maternity top. cute, but better suited for someone smaller chested.",0
I love this shirt so much i am ordering the coral too! the weight of the material makes it hang nicely. there is a lot of material but it lends itself to the flowy style. i got many compliments of this top!,1
"I love byron lars. very taken with his fabrics and design concepts and i have ordered several of his dresses but i believe i need to surrender to the fact that they do not work for my body type. the dress is gorgeous in person: all the fabrics are great, the dress is fully lined and lots of nice finishing touches. it is a unique and very striking dress; this one i really wanted. however, it is designed for a woman who is proportionally longer, leaner with a larger bust size than i have. i ordere",1
"Wanted to love this sweater for its beautiful colors and cute graphic, but the fit is uncomfortably small and it is so itchy i was yelling, ""get it off"" in the fitting room. bummer.",0
Okay this shirt is soooo comf. it is super fun and flowy. but it runs large. get one size smaller than you would usually get! so worth the sale price!!!,1
"This top is really cute and i think will be a great transition piece. i'm glad i tried it on in the store as it runs very small. i typically wear a 00 or 0 and bought this in a 2. they didn't have it in stock,so i ordered it and hope it fits.",1
Beautiful dress but have to return. way too big & long for me. medium is the size i wear but i think i would need an extra small.,0
"I love this top. the quality is excellent. the blouse is lined and falls nicely.. i like to wear it with a pair of dark gray jeans. the color is described as ""orange"", but it really has more of a bronze tone. looks very rich and exotic. it's perfect top when you want to wear jeans, but want to dress it up a bit.",1
"I'm 5'2 around 125 lbs, muscular and petite, so i ordered a petite small and it fits great. the length is perfect, i can wear with heels or dress down with flops. it's lined, which i think most dresses and skirts should be, so i was happy about that. i was pleasantly surprised with the slits up both sides, to show a little leg....sexy. it's not too low cut that you have to wear a cami and ruin the neckline, so that's plus. my only issue was the fabric didn't line up on me the same as the model,",1
"I agree with the other reviewers that this runs big. unfortunately there is nothing smaller than an xs so this is going back. i love the lyocell material, i have another skirt with this material and wanted to love this as well but it is too big and with the drawstring pulled tight to fit it doesn't look right. it is not as pictured as well. the skirt i received is a medium blue denim, not the lovely light blue as pictured, another reason why i am returning.",0
"I live in south florida so i'm always looking for sundresses that will be flattering (but not too clingy or hot), and that i can take from day to evening with accessories. when i pulled this out of the box and walked around in it, it met all my criteria, and as an added bonus, my husband said, ""wow! you look great! where'd you get that dress?"" i'm shocked because as an earlier reviewer said, this dress doesn't seem like much - it's not even lined. but it's comfy, flattering (in all the right pla",1
"I was really looking forward to receiving this blouse in the mail. the color was beautiful in person and the photo does not show the nice beading around the neck. that being said, i was so disappointed in the fit. i ordered a size 00 and the arm length was way too long yet the body of the shirt was way too cropped. cropped enough where you could see skin on the sides. made no sense! hoping to order a few more sizes to see if i can find the right fit. order up for length, down for arm length ...",0
"I order this shirt because it looked like a shirt you could dress up or down. when i got it the shirt was really wrinkled. therefore, i knew it would have to ironed a lot. it was quite boxy and was shorter in the front then in the back. i didn't realize that this shirt was two different fabrics. overall i think this shirt would be more flattering on a woman that was petite.",0
I want to the store to try this skirt on. that had only one size m in stock (my size) and it was huge! i ordered an xs and it fits nicely. it's just what i needed for the warm days ahead.,1
I loved this blouse when i got it and wore it before washing. it fit really well and was flattering. the only time i laundered it i hand- washed it in cold water and hung it to dry. the blouse shrunk at least a full size and in awkward places. the sleeves are now tight and way too short. the overall length shortened by at least 2 inches. the top is so tight in the bust now that the buttons popped open. i'm very disappointed and surprised.i will be returning it as it is unwearable as is.,0
"This bunches up too much, and the fabric is even more see through than i expected (so even with a tank top under it, it's not a good look for work). even unbuttoned at the top, i could barely get this over my head!  this one is going back.",0
"There is no way this is worth the price. i was deeply disappointed when it arrived. the material is thin and feels cheap. i love the design, and anna sui, but this is just so overpriced.",0
Beautiful victorian look blouse. runs large and overly blousy on me.,0
"Tried this blouse on in the store and fell in love with this top. i went down one size since i am a true petite. they were sold out of the petite small, but the regular x-small fit perfect. it is a little short so it's perfect for shorter people,",1
"Unfortunately i had to size down twice with there pants. great feel, they're soft and the grey is a soft color.",0
"The fabric is so beautiful that i am tempted to buy in a large size and have re-made. the waist is tiny. the hips are wide. when it goes to half price, i may be tempted to take it to my favorite alterations lady. the fabric is that exceptionally beautiful.",0
"These joggers are soo cute. they fit great!!
i seriously love them!! i have worn them so often
i may have to ban myself from them for a week.
i am 5'4 and the length was perfect for a jogger pant.
i got an xs because the small looked too baggy. 
the xs loosened up a little after wearing them and are perfect.",1
"If i could sew, i'd take the fabric from this skirt and make it into a different shape (after ordering a bigger size). the fabric is just as it appears online -- totally gorgeous with almost a quilted feel to it. however, this thickness means the skirt sticks out like something judy jetson would wear. it's also too small in my go-to skirt size (and i order a lot at retailer). the waist and hips are small (making the skirt too short as well), but the bottom flares out ridiculously. i ordered two of",0
"I bought these in the olive green, in the store and will be ordering the gray pair online. i am 5' 9"" and 145 lbs, long legs and these are beyond adorable. some people mentioned that they stretched out? i did not find this to be true. what i do know is they can be dressed up or dressed down. they are flattering and perfect for the spring/summer. i would highly recommend and would/will purchase in every color. well done retailer!! one of my most favorite purchases so far this spring.",1
"I love the flower patterns. they add feminine touch. this legging is well made with good quality spandex. the only cons is the color is not as deep as the picture. when you wearing it and the fabric stretched, the color looks much lighter. other than that, it's a good buy!",1
"This top is gorgeous in both detail in color. it fit great and true to size, but then i hand washed it as instructed on the label and it shrank substantially to the point that it's now too short and needs to be returned.",0
I loved the color and design of this dress but needed to return it because it fit so poorly. the arm holes are entirely too big -- so big that alternations couldn't fix it. maybe it's because i am petite but i think it may be a design flaw.,0
"The print on these leggings is so cool but they are completely see-through. i mean seriously, seriously see-through.",0
"Was so excited for this top! loved the embroidered detail and the teal green color. i got it in a medium and it was swimming on me. it also had a maternity type feel since there is a lot more material (making it look blousy) than showing on the model (they must have pinned it back in the stock photo).
sadly, it's going back.",0
I usually wear a size 8/10 and i needed a large in this skirt. it flows so beautifully!,1
This dress is attractive but it runs a little small. i'm a small curvy girl who usually wears a 2. this was small in the top and short waisted. i wanted to wear it to a recent event and didn't have time to return it for another size.,1
"These leggings were way longer and darker then appeared on model. 
they also were see through or beige color when stretched across hip.
especially for the high cost, there are much better althleisure leggings on the market.",0
"First, the good parts: these are adorable in person and (i think) the colors are prettier in person than in the pictures. the green isn't too army green, it's a pretty nice mellow neutral that you could wear with reds, whites, blues, pinks...virtually any color.

the tencel fabric is super soft and comfortable and the drape is nice. they do seem to run a little large, so i'd size down if you're between sizes.

and now, sadly, the bad: these stretch out virtually an entire size after just about a",0
Love this tank. it has an easy fit that hides my post baby belly with out looking to wide.,1
"This is a beautiful fabric and the skirt is so nice. what is wrong is the cut of the skirt. one side bells out more than the other, giving it an off center look from the front. my legs were not centered.",0
"I so wanted to love this dress! the fabric is gorgeous the styling beautiful and the construction is great - however, the armholes are cut too generously. i am 5'4"", 138 pounds and 36d. i ordered the black in a size 10. it fit me perfectly everywhere but the armholes. even with an undergarment, too much is exposed. i am sadly returning this.",0
"Hei hei is my favorite line. i am a medium in all of the pants i have ever purchased from this brand.
i ordered these in the green and they arrived today. they fit me as if they were an xxl. i have a similar pair in rust from last summer so i assumed that they would be the same. 
obviously they are going back tomorrow . i'm very disappointed, they are a nice looking jogger and the color is pretty.",0
"First of all, the label on this dress is maeve, not nue by shani. second, i just wasn't impressed. the fabric is cool...it has a sort of embossed look to it and it's somewhat shiny, which sets it apart in a good way. but the cut is just boring. the top felt dowdy to me...overall, i was underwhelmed by this dress and returned it.",0
"I was really wanting a nice white summer blouse to pair with patterned skirts. unfortunately, this fell short as it was huge. not only was it big, it flared at the bottom. it would be perfect if i was sporting a baby bump, but not what i am going for right now. if the tank was a bit slimmer i would have kept it as a tunic.i'm sad that i'll have to return it.",0
"L space is frustrating. i wear a 0/2 top but with 32d's i tried a large in this bikini top because from past experience with l space they run small. there's just zero support. the tie design helps secure the girls in place, but also flattens them out if you tie it tight enough so you don't spill out.",0
These were a little baggier than expected and the petite size ran long.,0
"These undergarments are comfortable, streamlined, and well made. this bra holds up well without wires. i am a 34b and wear a small. it is a bit tight at first, but form fits after one wear. . after trying one bra and i ordered 4 more. then i researched the brand and bought camis to match. i love how all the colors and styles are interchangeable.",1
I fell in love with this dress the instant i saw it. but was disappointed when i received it. first was the color. i chose the green and it wasn't what i thought. it was a very unnatural shade of artificial grass. when my husband saw it in the package he thought i had ordered a cheap grass hula skirt. the color was that bad. the fit was the next problem. this dress would have fit nicely if they had just added a side zip and made the top more fitted. the top was loose and that added to the flowy,0
"I was so excited to splurge on a mara hoffman suit and was sorely disappointed when i received this suit in the mail. i'm petite and fairly curvy, so i knew it would likely be a little long in the torso but the whole suit was so oddly shaped, i couldn't imagine anyone it would fit. the square shape in between the halter pieces is awkward, and the pieces that are supposed to hold your chest are super wide and loose.",0
"I really wanted this. they had two size small in my local retailer, both were damaged. so disappointing. i don't want to pay shipping for one that hopefully isn't damaged:( in the last year i've had multiple quality control issues with retailer. makes me gun shy. not sure i'm getting what i pay for anymore.",0
"I followed the advice of other reviewers and sized down from a s to xs. i was worried about the length of the torso since i'm long in that area, but the xs still worked great. it's a totally adorable jumpsuit with a nice fit. my biggest peeve with this was that it came dirty on the hems...like it had been dragged on the ground somewhere. unfortunately, there were no more xs online once i got it though, so i will keep and try to clean. this is not the first time in recent months that i have recei",1
"This would be perfect if only it were lined!!!! i have a high waist and hourglass shape so jumpers are very hard to find that fit my body type. this is a perfect fit for my body shape and when on, it looks like a lovely dress. however, it is not lined and the material is very light and ivory so you see everything. you can't wear a slip so that leaves the option of some sort of bodysuit if you don't want to show the world what you have. i am very tired of all of the light colored clothing not bei",0
I loooove this. my favorite retailer purchase in a while and i buy frequently. ran out of s p while in my basket (there are never enough petites available) so i got the medium. it is big but with this style i can pull it off. it does run a bit large so a s would have been perfect. please make this in more colors/fabrics! i would buy them all!,1
"I have been dying to try a mara hoffman bathing suit, so i went for this one. unfortunately, the design of the bathing suit is not like what they sent me. the middle where the tops meets the bottom, is squared off, not like that v that it looks like in this photo. it also makes for major side boob/sagging on each side. i was very disappointed.",0
"This dress was pretty but had a weird fit. the waist droops down in the middle instead of going straight across, which i found unflattering. i ended up returning it.",0
"These are super soft and relaxed. i have them in navy and lavender. i am 5'6"" and 130 lbs. and ordered them in a 28, which fits loosely, but comfortably.",1
"I really wanted to like his dress, but it was a big miss. big big miss. look at the way the skirt is attached to the dress in the photo. it goes up high on the sides leaving a short bodice. the sequined patterns hit right at my breasts, so it looked like glittery bra cups on the front. the back glittery pattern looked like bird wings on my back. it was far shorter than i expected. overall, it looked like i was desperately trying to be a sexy angel or fairy. bad bad bad.",0
"Great fabric but unfortunately it did not look good on me. maybe on a tall person, i'm only 5'4"". really wanted to like this...",0
"I was disappointed with this jumpsuit. when i first saw it in the store, i thought i was going to love it. when i tried it on, the first issue is the fabric is too sheer. i could completely see the outline of my underwear and bra. it also runs way too big! i know the bottom is supposed to be loose and flowy, but the waist needs to be more tapered to off set that, and it's so baggy. the arm holes are also cut very low, so when you lift your arms you can see most of your bra on the sides 
i wante",0
"A sales associate found this for me at my local retailer. i probably would have never thought to try it on. i am 5'1'' and normally a size 8 or a medium. the size small was still too large, so i ordered a size small petite. it fits perfectly, looks adorable on, and is so comfortable. i can't wait for the warm weather to wear it!",1
"This was so unflattering. the bust was too high so it hit me weird on the boobs. the green was a beautiful, vibrant color but the fabric is so delicate that one wrong move would cause a snag.",0
"I opened the package and the dress is two pieces. it is the skirt part with an orange cami top that the sweater goes over. the sweater was too short for me, as i am busty and would not work. i ordered my normal size and the band around the rib cage did not go from side to side so i didn't try it on.",0
"I'm very picky about jumpers, and this one is abolutely perfect! i love how it looks like a dress at first glance. it runs a little big because of the oversized fit it is supposed to have, i sized down because of the armpit area. nude garments and you'll be fine. this is going to sell out fast, don't wait for it to go on sale! (seriously my store is already out of xs's)",1
"I am 5'-7"" and 135 lbs, i bought a medium petite as i wanted the dress to hit at my knees, instead of midi. this dress is easily 2 sizes bigger than expected. the pattern was not flattering on my although i'm sure it would be for others. i was happy with the length...",0
"I really wanted to love this dress. i bought it for a photoshoot that will be outdoors, and thought that the green color would be perfect. it is well made, but the fabric is lighter than expected. the biggest issues was the size. i am 5'7"" and typically a size ten. i ordered the ten and it fit like a 14-16. it was huge. if you order this, i would say size down two sizes.",0
"This dress is beautiful and would make an excellent party dress for winter. it is well made and the details are pretty. however the waist is cut in sort of a scallop shape, so it is higher on the sizes and dips down in the middle over the stomach. i wear a size l or 10 in dresses at retailer, and it just did not flatter my body type at all. for a thinner, narrow silhouette, i suppose it would look better, like it does on the model. i had to return it.",0
"I purchased this in the mauve color. beautiful color with tan skin for the summer, but also perfect for fall. the material is very thin but not sheer at all. has quite a bit of drape/swing to it so i sized up to make sure it was long enough. it fits me like it fits the model shown here. i am about 5'4"" 115lbs and 32b and am keeping the small.",1
"I tried these on at my local retailer, and was like, no way am i spending almost $300 on a pair of jeans. alas, i could not stop thinking about them. the pictures really don't do them justice. they are a more substantial jean, have a distressed look, without being fragile. and yet they are so soft, so comfortable, you really just don't want to take them off. they do have a bit of stretch, but hold their shape all day long. the length and taper are perfect, in that you can wear them with boots, san",1
"I love this dress, i disagree with the review saying it was too sheer. this is a thicker material and doesnt need a slip, it is beautiful and is so comfy. it looks good with heels or sandals. i definately recommend this dress, it would look good on any body type.",1
"This top is cute and could be worn to work or casually. being tall, i love how long this shirt is! definitely recommend!",1
I bought the blue pattern and really have found this print to be very fun and flattering and the tunic style great for work and play. highly recommend!!!,1
"I'm 5""0"" and weigh 105 lbs. i purchased the xxs and it was super-wide, and big all over. it looked like a pregnancy top and did not lay as nicely as shown on the model. also, not shown on the model is the front is short and the back is very long. this would work better on a taller person. i just find it odd that a xxs is still too big. the quality of the fabric and the print is good and the lace-up in the back is cute.",0
I've been eyeing this top up in the floral pattern for a while and finally ordered it when i had 15% off. i really don't think it's worth the price and it's not very flattering. i think it would look better on someone less busty - it seemed to accent my bust. it's definitely not my favorite piece and unfortunately i will be returning.,0
"It looks great on the model but not on me. on me, it looked more like a sack of potatoes. the fabric is unexpected for the style in my opinion. it is very thick. i'll be returning it because it is not flattering on me.",0
This dress looked gorgeous in the monthly catalog. ordered in hopes to wear in easter. i felt it was frumpy and just ok. color was pretty but overall; i didn't love it like i hoped to.,0
"I'm small (4'11, 98 pounds and 34a) so the regular xs looks like a baby doll dress on me.  i just wear the tunic with a tank top underneath (or i can wear the tunic by itself) and leggings plus a pair of boots.  the top part is slightly baggy so if you want tight fitting, is size down to xxs.  i got the yellow flower and white + grey one and plan to get the navy one soon.  the quality is good and you can machine wash it with cold water.  i plan to use a tide sweater garment bag to wash it (i put",1
"I had reservations about this top based on other reviews, but it looked cute on the model so i took my chances. i have an athletic build--not model-thin, but not dumpy either--and this top made me look very frumpy and matronly. the sleeves were especially unflattering. i purchased it in an ps and might have done better with a pxs.",0
"I usually wear a size xs or s in retailer tops, ordered this top in an s and it was so wide on the sides and huge it fit like a tent.  not even remotely flattering.  i thought about ordering it in an xs, however, i could tell the xs was still going to have way too much fabric.  back it goes.",0
"I am a solid size 6 in most brands, top and bottom, 5'3"" tall, 125#. i have long legs, short torso, and fairly broad shoulders - i almost never wear petite sizes.however, this top in the regular small size could be a maternity dress on me! i am literally swimming in it, and it is quite long. however, i can still make it work, with a cami underneath and leggings or skinny jeans... i like it, did not return, and will buy another color, but will go with petite x-small in the future.",1
I ordered the yellow/floral version in size xl. it fits me just as shown with the model so it's true to size. it's very comfortable and made well. the floral looks the same in person as in the photos too.,1
"Got the flower print and it is really a nice top. covers the butt!. i normally need a xl, but in this top i got a large.",1
"I received this in the mail a few days ago, and was so pleased with it except that it was huge! i am normally a 10/12 in most things so i ordered a large. i was swimming in it in all areas - shoulders and bust bothered me most because i need a waist on shirts so i don't look larger than i am. i liked it enough to o ahead and order a size down. i ordered a medium and medium petite because the top is quite long and i think i could get away with wearing it with leggings or tights if i were looking",1
"Everyone has said it, so i'll just add my two cents - this is a great, soft, flattering top. i bought two, one in white and one in black, and i have never worn them without getting compliments. i sometimes wear them buttoned up, and sometimes completely unbuttoned to expose tanks or bathing suits. (i live in florida, and these tops make great beach cover ups). i am 5'7"" and over 160 but not busty, and the medium was swimming on me, but i think this particular shirt is supposed to be that way. su",1
"I wanted to love this top, but it unfortunately did not work for me. the material has a nice weight and feel to it, and while i love the pattern, the shape leaves something to be desired. the cap sleeves were a little tight on my arms, and the cut of the sleeves made my arms look big. the body of this shirt reminded me of a loose maternity top. for reference, i am 5'10"" 140 lbs and typically a size 6. i wear a small in retailer clothes, and got a small in this top. i think an xs would have been to",0
"Picture definitely does not do this vest justice.  i saw it on a rack and had to try on and instantly loved the look and feel.  i am 5'9"" - 135 lbs - size 6 and the small works for me.  the vest will work with ivory, black, grey, and red underneath.  i love the little bits of fur sticking out of the seams.  the back has fitted seams to give it a trim look.  there are small pockets in the front as well.  definitely worth the 108$ asking price.",1
I purchased this in 2 colors. the black which is really actually a dark grey( no complaints) and the cream with black print version. i have worn both at least once a week and receive compliments everytime! looks great with skinny pants or jeans. great alone or layered with a jacket or cardigan. does run on the looser side fyi,1
"I ordered this dress in the blood orange and have a few complaints. while it appears to be made with quality, it runs really large. also, in the picture the fabric appears to have a sheen and be somewhat dressy. the actual fabric is just flat cotton. it's a very casual dress, not as dressy as pictured. it's also quite shapeless on. i'm returning it.",0
"This dress was not what i had hoped! from the online pictures, i had high hopes, but the fit was really wonky and the material seemed cheap. the arm holes were too big and made the dress seem more like a bathing suit cover up than a classy summer dress. needless to say, it's going back!",0
"Bought this top in white and blue motif. it fits me great and looks adorable. the only comment is that the holes for the buttons are a little too big but it's an easy fix.
this top looks great dressed up or down. would definitely recommend!",1
"Just purchased this yesterday in the store and i can't wait to wear it! it is a perfect spring/summer top when you just want to wear something pretty and comfortable! i agree that it is big but that is the style of this shirt. so if you're ok with this look, you will love this shirt! i took my usual medium and the prints are adorable! a great addition to my wardrobe!",1
"Love this top! i receive so many compliments wearing it, even from my teenage boys! runs large, but that's the style of it, very flowy. very flattering.",1
"I loved this top in the blue and wanted so badly for it to fit however it was very unflattering on my 5'7"" frame. the bottom hemline is straight across all around whereas i thought it was longer in the back. i could see this looking great on a really petite frame. runs large, xs fit however wasn't flattering",0
"Didn't work on this curvy gal.
sizing up would have helped with the button gaps, but the flowy shape of the blouse would have looked too maternity on a larger size.
major pass.",0
Wanted to like this top but it looks terrible and does not lay right. the bust line is not tight enough to contrast the rest of the top being flowy. does not give any shape to the body. do not recommend for anyone with a medium to large chest.,0
"Love this top. bought it in both color ways. just adorable and washes well. great option for larger ladies. 
retailer needs to provide more xls to be available in the stores. i shop at the pasadena store and see so many women my size shopping right next to me, and there is nothing for us. it is so sad that we want to spend our money with you, but you don't want it.",1
Like the extra details on the neck and back - and it's versatile to wear everywhere,1
"Agree with other contributer - this is a great piece to snag on sale. i bought this 2 months post partum with the intention of hiding the post baby belly - which is does well! i think it fits true to size (i'm typically l and this l fit well). i can see how certain body types it would look maternity, but i'm short and curvy and the blouse is flattering. it's lightweight, so i plan to add a cardigan in the fall/winter.",1
"I read all the reviews and was hoping that this top would work for me, but it did not. i ordered a size smaller than usual and it was still way too big. it was not flattering at all on my curvy frame. overall, it looked more like a maternity top on me then anything else! if you're tall and slender, i think this top would work!",0
"I've been on the hunt for the perfect dress to wear for my daughter's first birthday party. since we are throwing a traditional korean first birthday, i was looking for a dress you might wear to a daytime wedding or a fancy brunch. i just purchased this dress today in the store and it fits my needs perfectly. 

i disagree with the first reviewer who mentioned that this dress was too sheer. this dress is a thicker fabric so i do not think i will need a slip when wearing it. it does drape nicely",1
"This shirt is so very pretty in person. the detail on the neckline and the lace up on the back are so cute and give the shirt just a bit of whimsy, making it more unique than your usual flowy t-shirt. it lays perfectly and the material is very soft and comfy. you can wear it casual or dress it up. i may get another one because this is the kind of shirt i will wear constantly!",1
"I bought two, one in white and one in blue print and wore the blue print top once and loved it. then i washed it according to the instructions on the tag (in cold gentle cycle and hung to dry). it shrunk up 4"" in the length and 2"" in the width and now it doesn't fit at all. also, after one wear, the buttons are coming off (before i even put it in the wash) and it's covered in loose threads. the quality is just not there. i'm going to return both and show the sales lady the difference in size on",0
"I usually wear a size 28 & the fit was perfect. highly recommend, many compliments.",1
"....that's what i look like wearing this dress. a sad, sad, sack. the fabric is less than ideal, and there is no shape to speak of. i love that it has pockets but that's about it. there was just way too much fabric for a petite person. this dress has got to be good on someone, sadly that person was not me.",0
"I loved this top so much i bought it in both colors. size down because it run very large, but it is nice and flowy. i'm 5'11"" and slim and the top hung nicely on me.",1
"I wanted to love this, was so excited when i ordered it online. the fabric (blue and white) was beautiful, but the cut was bad. it fit me like a maternity top, and made me look like i was 6 months along. i have a feeling that the models had theirs pinned back, in the back, because it does not lay flat like that in front, it has a lot of fabric with no place to go but up and out. returning.",0
"I purchased this poncho online in the cream color. when it arrived i tried it on to decide whether or not to keep it. i immediately went on line and purchased the taupe color , as well. thank goodness it didn't come in 5 more colors! this sweater is so versatile and beautifully detailed, plus it is very soft. you take one look at it and you know the quality! i think you could wear this dressed up or down and it would be perfect either way. i do agree, it is not quite as long as pictured , but pe",1
Super cute poncho to add to my wardrobe.  love the grey color and the material is super soft.  glad i snagged this up for less than $30!,1
"Great top!! love the fit, it pairs great with dark denim and pearls!! i ordered a 00 and am a 32c cup and 24-25 waist",1
Really wanted to love dress but something was off with fit. fabric is lovely and zipper detail nice unfortunately style was not for me.,0
"An absolutely gorgeous, but poorly fitting blouse. the bottom part is way too billowy and inconsistent with the fitted top half. got it on sale and still returned it.",0
The blue lace with the white top underneath is very pretty. unfortunately i did not like how billowy it was below the bra line.,0
It is definitely pinned back on the model in the photograph. it made my 5 foot frame look short and wide.,0
"For reference i am 5'5' 138 lbs with an hourglass figure and my usual small fit perfectly. the problems: 1. this skirt is not black but a charcoal gray/purple. 2. the sipper is reinforces with a stiff boarder on the inside so no matter where i put the waist it sticks straight out making me look like i have a tail under my skirt. in other words, i had a very pointy butt. also the slit or tulip part of the skirt goes all the way up to the waist, it needed to be tacked to the other part of the skir",0
"I've been buying stevie ankles for years from retailer and been very happy. the past two pairs i bought had a heavy chemical smell, which i imagine is some kind of starch/chemical to keep the denim stiff. with the first pair, after enough washes to get rid of the bad smell (4), they lost all form and looked terrible since they were washed i couldn't return them. the 2nd pair arrived with the same heavy smell and i returned them. it may be they are made elsewhere now, but it's disappointing.",0
I'm so incredibly disappointed. the dress is beautiful but the one i received is torn and has multiple strands of beads missing. poor quality control.,0
"These leggings are wonderful. they are incredibly soft, and stay in place when working out.",1
"I am reasonably petite, but i like sweaters very oversized and large, so i ordered this sweater in a large. i was very disappointed when the sweater came because while the sleeves and upper chest area were in large, the length of the sweater did not at all increase when the size did. because the lower part of the sweater did not increase in size, the sweater ended up looking very awkward, with the chest and sleeves very large and long but then a very tight and short (waist-length) stomach. i do",0
"I wanted to love this dress, and thought it would be perfect for a barn wedding i have coming up. it was allllllmost right but sadly fell short. the bib that hangs over the bust hits in a really unflattering mid point that makes you look wide. nipple tassels effect. plus i would feel the urge to keep pulling it down. did notice some of the puckering others mentioned but didn't bother me, however, the way the lining and the dress line up at the bottom did. so close, so sad",0
"I ordered the grey/yellow ""here comes the sun"" shirt. it's cute, but it runs quite large and isn't special enough for the price. meh.",0
"I ordered the light pink version in size xl. the details of the top and the shade of pink are pretty. but, the shirt fits me much shorter than on the model. i'm not quite 5 ft. 6 inches so it should have worked. the material is thin so i was able to stretch it out to give more length. it does look stretched-out now though. i washed it and it shrank a bit so i stretched it again. this is a top that i kept to wear under vests. the pretty colors and the softness of the material make it worth keepin",0
"I wanted to love this dress as it would have been perfect for a wedding i have in october however, the fit was awful;. the dress was heavy with a funky liner. it also had these little black straps around the top of the arm/neck that looked out of place. it ran true to size but i have a large chest (32dd) and it was pretty fitted around the area but loose everywhere else. 

sadly, dress had to be returned.",0
I ordered this blouse online bc i couldn't find it in my local stores once it was on sale. the fabric is so delicate. the cutouts had already frayed and in some places torn. had to return it.,0
"I like this top. yes it is very cropped and fitted but that's the style as shown on the model in the picture. but its true this style may not fits everyone. it probably flatters those of athletic or petite figure more than a full figure. i am 5' 6"" 110#. my usual size is xs. the top looks small to me at first so i tried both size xs and s. i took the xs cause i like it look fitted than loose. i wear this top with high waist fitted skirts or pants and it looks great. if this top can be an inch lo",1
Very disappointed. the cutouts started to rip the first time i wore it. i've only worn it twice and i love it but the cut outs are embarrassing.,0
"Huge bummer. this top is definitely a crop/midi-top. plus, it's cream, not white like shown in the photos. i'm returning it today.",0
"I was so excited to get this dress. i need it for a wedding, and i thought i had hit the jackpot. the dress arrived with a small tear. the seams are puckered and badly seen.  for an almost $300.00 dress, the quality is terrible. i expect better from retailer. i'm so disappointed.",0
"This is a very pretty shirt which is too narrow across the back. i need to be able to move my arms freely at work, so this did not work for me. you may be able to size up for a better fit if moving your arms is important to you.",0
"I really like this jacket. very comfortable, nice material. i like the weight of this jacket, i wore it alone but it will be cute with a t-shirt under it too.",1
"I purchased this shirt in grey. i loved the color and the details, especially the lace on the shoulders. i just found the fit to be off for me. the style certainly calls for a relaxed fit but the small was loose in an unflattering way. had the xs been available i might have considered exchanging for an xs but the s was already a bit short on me. (strange because although i am not petite, i am fairly short wasted.) i also wasn't in love with the neckline. i will continue my search for a weekend-w",0
It's short and wide. not a good combo for anyone who isn't stick thin.,0
I purchased this sweater in a small . nothing on the web site states it has dolman sleeves! it looked sloppy and made my bust disappear! it went back i hate dolman sleeves.,0
Cute top but started disintegrating after two washes. the delicate cutouts in the top tore apart. i machine washed it in the gentle cycle and didn't use the dryer. disappointed to have to discard the top after just buying it.,0
"I received this as a gift. it is a very pretty top, but the material is sooo delicate that the cutout areas were torn in many spots and where it wasn't torn completely you could see it fraying. the sales associate said they get many returns on this item.",0
"This runs way big.  i would recommend sizing down at least one size.  possibly 2.

i got the design with divers.  it's fun and light for summer.  soft material and very comfy.",1
"Although i love the soft feel of the sweater, the zig zag design was very unflattering. also, the length is much shorter than appears in the picture. i will be returning it.",0
"Wished this had worked for me! however, i prefer smaller armholes so my bra and skin (not so young anymore) don't show. the beige lining shows at the armholes as well. on the upside, it's very slimming even with the stiff petticoat. so cute! perfect length for me. another caveat -- if your back is not completely symmetrical, as mine isn't, the decorative back straps sit in a wonky position. i'm 98 lbs, 4' 10"", and the oop was perfect but for the above objections.",1
"For the price of this dress, i was expecting something decent. the style is cute, but nothing more. however, the type of the polyester that the dress is made of.... oh my. it is a thick unpleasant material, that will cling to a body when it is hot. i never came across an item at retailer that was made this cheaply.
the tag on the back was hanging at half and the button on the front was ready to come off before i even tried this dress on.
no need to say - it's going back asap.
you should not sel",0
"I have been wanting this sweater and decided to order. when i received it, there was no tag on the product. it was not in a typical clear bag from retailer and it wasn't packaged nicely. it came from reno, nv. most products i order do not get shipped from there. it is short, and i'm 5'1"". most clothes that are short fit me with no problem. this sweater might hit me at the waist, or maybe shorter. i think the color is nice and the sweater is soft but not what i wanted. i am going to return it",0
"Fantastic signature retailer styling with this unique statement sweater. the pattern placement has a slimming look on the front and a rear enhancing look from behind. i've been using the super soft removable fur collar as a scarf and stole for my other outfits as well. the length is almost tunic on me, so it looks great with leggings and skinny jeans while buttoned up. if you choose to remove the fur collar the v-neck is very open, so i keep it unbuttoned when i style it that way. knit fabric is s",1
Overall i really like this dress. the color is vibrant & unique. the top of the dress especially the shoulder straps seem loose so i'm getting it tailored.,1
"I just couldn't resist this dress! it's blue, it's fun, it's feminine. the color is so vivid and beautiful in person. i was worried that the length would be an issue (i bought a regular size instead of my normal petite), but i feel that it is perfect. it fits great, and i know i will wear it a lot this summer.",1
"Great fit, perfect length! so happy with these jeans. the fabric is pretty stretchy but definitely still has a denim feel. very soft - love these jeans!",1
"I bought this top at my local retailer in a burgundy color. it is so beautiful and feminine. i want to get it in the other color they had in the store and also this black one available on-line. i bought it in a size 6 and i am 5' 2"" , 34d. i sometimes get tops in petite but i felt the reg size fit just fine.",1
I purchased this item as a gift for my wife and she loves it. the quality for the price is great. soft and comfortable. needs to be washed with care but is worth it,1
"I kept the size 8 of the dress and had to return the 10 as it was too roomy at the arms and chest (which is great!!!). material is nice and not too much material, hangs nice (its a swing). another win!",1
"This top runs small across the top. i was amazed at the material--polyester, i am sure--because the price was so high. it has a sheer layer underneath, which i think would make it hot in the summer. i love this kind of tank but it just did not look as good as it does online.",0
"I bought this tank in the blue popsicle print, and i think it's cuter in person than it is online. the beautiful pastel colors on the popsicles really stand out and make it special. i am normally a size 4-6, and the small fits me perfectly. also, i appreciate that it's lined. i wore it with skinnies, and received lots of compliments. it's the perfect tank for summer!",1
"I ordered this in the ""plum"" color, which in real life just looks like a very, very dark brown. that would probably be okay, but the dress is actually about 3 inches shorter than the listed measurements. i ordered the regular length, but the shortest part of the hem hits me only about halfway down my thigh...way, way too short. i am 5'5"", for reference. lastly, i think the fabric is just awful quality, especially for this price point. the slight texture makes it want to cling to itself - worn ou",0
The price is high and i have to dry clean this? no thanks.,0
"This is a great summer maxi dress. i am 5'4"" 120lbs, about a size 4 in dresses, 32dd. i got this in an extra small. i was really happy that on someone my height, it's just a few inches above my ankle, so did not shorten me at all. the straps were a good length, and the waist hit at the right spot. i don't think the waist detail not going all the way around is a big deal, there are the little snaps in the straps for your bra, and skirt is lined. the turquoise color is really pretty and the fabric",1
"Dress is very pretty, but very short, almost tunic length.",1
"This is, like many reviewers stated, a very flattering and nice dress. the sleeves were particularly great, because they are slightly longer than most of this type and went past the meaty (for lack of a better word!) part of my arm, only exposing the slimmer bits. it looked great on me, and i imagine it would on most people. i just did not like the handkerchief hem....too young, too trendy? i don't know, when you're in your 40s, you start to feel ridiculous in certain styles! i just didn't feel",1
"I'm a big retailer buyer- and usually love the dresses, especially the petite xs maxis. this was the worst retailer purchase i have ever made. 

it was humongous and gave me no shape. even if i purchased an xxsp it probably would be the same. i'm small but i mean come on- this would only fit a giantess-- which also makes no sense because it's the petite size. 

do not buy. i'm very upset i have to pay the $5.95 return fee since i ordered this.",0
"The dress is just ok. i cannot imagine having paid full price for this. i got it for florida vacation. i put it on to wear to church first and spilled a drop of lavender oil on it and it stained!!!! cant get it out. thats punk for a dress that even on sale is like. 
sending back",0
"Looks fitted on, but this just turned out to be an oversized muumuu on. the fabric also felt cheap.",0
"Perfection! i am 5'3""/108 and the size 25 fit me like a glove. beautiful color too!! highly recommend!!",1
"So i got this on sale and the only size they had was a xs petite. i didn't have my hopes very high but i thought i would give it a shot. the dress came today and it fit great. i am 5""6"" so the petite came just above my knees but the dress is still adorable. the material and cut is great. this is not what i was looking for but it is a welcome addition.",1
"I have mixed feelings about this dress. the color is fantastic. not too bright, not too dark. the material is super soft and comfortable and the length was perfect. i did end up returning this item though as no matter which bra i chose, the straps showed. it just was not hitting my right on the shoulders. i do not like having my bra straps show or constantly be trying to tuck them away (especially at a wedding or work?). this is what ultimately led me to return the dress ? even though it is beau",0
"I love the cut and aesthetic of this shirt, but the fabric unfortunately shows even the slightest hint of sweat, which makes it difficult to wear without being self conscious",1
Despite other reviewers comments on size - i really wanted this one to work so i ordered it. i'm typically a size xs and d chest and instead i ordered a small. the body of the sit for well but the cups of the suit i'd said for more for a b. (if i lifted my arms i would literally come out of it),0
"This is a nice shirt, but i can't keep it. i ordered a 0 and i do have an athletic build with somewhat wider shoulders given how petite i am (usually wear 00 petite in all pants) and i think this size was perfect (fit across the back perfectly) when you lift your arms the way it is cut makes it really tight across the chest and shows your stomach. at the same time, the high low styling makes for a really strange shirt-tail in the back. i'm sure this is the trend but it really does not look cute",0
"I just got this in the mail & had to immediately write a review. i love it!. i took a risk & ordered the xxs, which i assume is a 00. it fits me perfectly so i would say it runs large. i'm a true dress size 2 but usually wear a 0 or xs in us sizing. the shoulder length from seam to seam is about 14 inches. i'm 32c-24-34. hope this helps!",1
"Love this top! i bought it last month in the olive green color and love it. great quality fabric, comfortable and can be dressed up or down.",1
You have to be a contortionist to get this bra on. it slips over your head and i needed my 8yo daughter to help me pull it down past my elbows. ridiculously impractical. why oh why didn't heather give it a hook and loop closure instead?,0
"This was going to be my go to top. i loved the look of the billowy shirt, especially in light blue. when it arrived, i knew it wouldn't work for my body. i'm athletic build with muscular upper arms and a d cup. i tried it on anyway. i really wish it fit. it was snug in the upper arms and pulled a bit in the front. i knew if i ordered a size up the arms would still be tight. it's just the cut of the shirt. this top is best for someone that isn't busty and has slender upper arms.",0
"I was looking for an oversized silhouette but this is more like a beach cover-up. the waist does not have elastic or any structure. the top fabric is crossed over but not sewn closed, and because the fit is so loose it just gaps open. the fabric is nice quality but i am returning.",0
"I got tons of compliments when i wore this top out a couple weeks ago. it is a little bit shorter than i thought, and a little bit loose (not ""baggy"" but just kind of hangs). if you have a larger chest, this may not be super-flattering. the color is really pretty and looked great with dark skinnies. i bought my normal size (after trying on a size down, which was just too short...and i'm 5'2)",1
I loved the color and the style of the sleeves.  it was a bit too short on me and i thought it made me look boxy so i didn't end up keeping it,1
I got these on sale a few months ago. they are the most comfortable jeans i've ever owned. i'm 5'4 and they are the perfect length for me but i like my jeans a little long.,1
Runs a size big unless you want it really boxy. felt the matl was flimsy and would prob pill soon. turquoise was a pretty color but returning this one.,0
"I ordered these because i loved the wide cut and overall look. but returned them because they fit weird. too tight around the too high waistline (and normally, i like a high waistline). fit ran small. and the overall quality of the fabric wasn't as nice as i was hoping for. pretty disappointed.",0
"I wanted this tank to work so badly! it was a great deal and so beautiful. unfortunately the top fitted portion ends right below my chest then the shirt flares out so i looked like a cupcake. my belly also showed slightly because the shirt is short. if you have a short torso, this would work great. if not, unfortunately, its not great - tear",0
"I am 5'8 with curvy, muscular body and 36ddd boobs. the ruffle ends up hitting me right below my breasts and creates the look of being about 6 months pregnant. the beading is beautiful and i wish that it fit.",0
The sweater coat would be wonderful for cooler weather this fall. i ordered it in medium because the small sizes were sold out. sometimes a medium is the right size depending on the brand. i was disappointed that the coat was so large; i don't think it will work for me even with layers underneath. it's a great design but i may have to return it.,1
I love this! seriously would buy again. i wish it was warmer out so i could wear it,1
"This jacket runs very large. i usually wear an xl but probably could fit into a medium. i have long arms, and the sleeves were way past my hands. i love the jacket, but it's just too sloppy.",1
"I wanted to like this top so so so so badly. so badly in fact, that after the first size didn't fit, i ordered two other sizes to make sure: xl, l, m. none of them worked i really wanted to like this top. the online photo makes the clothing look so flattering and the shirt is just not....at least on me. the shirt online on the model looks slimming and a lot longer than the actual piece of the clothing. the beaded work is very beautiful, but short causing the very poofy peplum to start at the mos",0
"I followed the advice of other reviewers and sized down. however, the jacket was still too large. it fit fine in the arms but the body/width of the jacket was huge. also i found the wool material to be extremely itchy. it might work if you are layering it over long sleeves but still make sure to size down at least one or maybe even two sizes.",0
"Beautiful dress with the colors and pleats. i did not have the same problems with the bust area that others did. my biggest complaint is the exposed zipper doesn&#39;t lay flat, even when just hanging on the hanger. when actually on a person the zipper juts out. had to be returned!",0
"I have to confess i had very high hopes for this dress. i was buying it as a stylish, modern alternative to a business suit. i wanted this dress to work as a piece to deliver presentations in or attend faculty functions. tailored, conservative, and edgy at the same time. several hundred dollars dress should meet the aforementioned needs, i thought. but it did not. the best description for the dress is ""blah"", average.

the material is textures and crinkly, not slick. the top is cream/ivory color",0
"It's rare to find such a great skirt -- flattering, unique design, substantial (denim-like) fabric, something with pockets! this skirt has everything, including an adjustable buckled waist. i love the slight a-line shape, too. for me it fits true to size (the same size i wear in skirts from other brands). i love the colors -- ivory background, cobalt, periwinkle, orange, blush pink, yellow, black. it will be easy to pair with tees or button-down shirts and cute sandals.",1
"I really liked this top when i tried it on but as i wore it the bottom of the sleeves stretched out terrible where they looked worn out from wearing over and over, and since this happened with the first wearing and i paid $88.00 i sent it back. if it hadn't been for that it's a comfy and cute casual top",0
"I know this product description says oversized but that's an understatement. i ordered a small and tried it on and i looked like a little kid in their father's jacket. i don't even think an xs would have worked. i'm 5'6"" and about 135 pounds for reference. i will say that the embroidery on the back is very cool and this jacket is overall a cool concept but it's just way too big.",0
"Agreed with the previous reviewer, this is the same dress as the evanthe dress that came out this summer, but in a rich beautiful red/wine color. the color differences in the pattern are , however, more subtle than the summer version, remaining in one palette. yo u can't tell from the picture, but the back is longer than the front. the neckline is very flattering, i found this one a little more snug than the evanthe (around the rib cage), tried on 00p (size for evanthe) might be better as 0p in",1
"I bought three of these this summer--a mint, ivory, and yellow. when i received them, they looked nice enough in person. i liked the heart motif and the peplum. the problem is the knit was on the cheap side and stretched out. the arms were tighter than i liked but loosened up through the day. but, then the look became more matronly. i wish they had been 3/4 length or a vest. the cheap, outstretched look just didn't work. i ended up donating all of mine after a few wears. they also pilled conside",0
This is such a beautiful dress.  but have to return for the reasons others have noted.  the chest does not fit well.,0
"Girls, this dress is gorgeous.  but if you are an a/b cup, there is just too much fabric in the bust.  the entire dress is pleated from the shoulders down, so a curvier figure would be shown to great advantage in this beautiful number.  alas, i had to send it back and was very sad to do so.",1
"Really wanted this to worked for me. ordered the s in ivory (the color i really wanted but xs was sold out) and the xs in cedar.  loved the knit and look and quality but the sweater was boxy and huge even in xs.  not flattering on my petite frame (5'2"", 115#).  so disappointed as i've been looking for a non-wool sweater like this.",1
I saw this online and loved it. plus after reading the reviews i thought why not. but if you have a big chest beware. i am a 34ddd and a pretty solid medium. the volumous front of the vest added way to much to me and i sized down to a small. had to return.,1
"Love, love this clever eyeglass print. i bought the black background with bright sunglass print - perfect for pairing with jeans, shorts or a slender skirt.",1
Exactly as pictured. great fit. love it.,1
I wear this vest two ways - over a long sleeve shirt when it's warmer and layered over a shirt and cardigan when it's cooler. it's the perfect amount of warmth when i'm running errands and don't want to wear a heavy coat. love it and plan to wear it a lot!,1
This vest was of excellent weight but it had very little style. it was like a giant piece of felt was cut out with little thought to design or nuance. not for me.,0
"This jacket is my favorite purchase in a while! i used my last month 50th birthday discount on it!
it is of exceptional materials and quality construction. the juxtaposition of the stripes against the beautifully vibrant embroidery on back is stunning! it does run true to size as it is an oversized piece, which adds to its classy dramatic flare! my size medium came in the european size 38. for reference, i am an american size 8-10. 
it is comfortable to wear and can easily accomodate large ful",1
I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer. the shirt in our store was featured in all colors.  i chose the burnt orange color to try on and it is was incredibly soft!  i felt like i was wearing a t-shirt with an easy on and easy off feel. the flow of the shirt allows you to wear out or tuck in.  i paired with teal velvet crops and tucked the shirt in for more structure to the outfit. love!!!,1
"Love this sweater, do wish i sized up for a little longer length, but works great with high rise pants.  comfy and great color",1
"I felt inspired to write a review as soon as i put this on. the vest fits so well, and the thick fabric feels amazing. love the pockets! like the previous reviewer, i feel like i'll be able to wear this with workout clothes or with a dressier outfit. it has an ever so slight racer back, so probably would look weird with sleeveless tops that come all the way to your shoulders, but i can already think about so many ways i want to wear it. the draping in the front also falls really nicely. great bu",1
"I ordered a small and it is enormous; i usually wear a size 10. it is short but the fullness in the body and the sleeves made me look like a sumo wrestler. also, it is a very heavy knit which would be great for up north but too bulky for atlanta unless the temps are in the 40s. i'm sending it back.",0
"The colors of this dress are beautiful and i really wanted to love it but it wasn't cut for my body shape. i think you either need to be curvy to fill out the chest or straight up&down to have it lay flat (as in the model). ordered size 6: 34b, 150 5' 9"", tall/slim build. i also think the hi/lo hem of the dress isn't well indicated in the pictures; i'm not a fan of the style and was hoping it would be minimal however the hem is definitely asymmetric.",1
This is really cute - it has a boxy look and bell-like sleeves. the knit is chunky and so very soft. i didn't want to take it off. i purchased an xs in black. it's gorgeous. my beige bra shows through so i will need to wear black or a camp underneath. it feels really heavy - in a good way - and it feels like it will be really warm. the black has a velvety look to it. i'm smitten. i should also mention that it did feel cropped to me - i know i read other reviews that said it wasn't cropped. i fee,1
"Lovely knit and so soft, but the bottom curls up underneath, similar to the bell sleeves. runs oversize too, got xs and it's too bulky and unflattering since the bottom doesn't lay flat. returned!",0
"This would be great on someone with a slim build. it's very true to size, it hits above the hips and runs pretty straight through the body for a boxy look. i loved the color and pointelle detail but on my thicker build it just sort of hung in a too-casual way. note that it is the kind of cotton that is likely to stretch with wear (and spring back with cleaning).",1
"I tried these on at the store and thought the color, texture and style was very nice, but i needed the petite length. so i came online but was disappointed to see that the style is sold out in petite! darn. the regular length hits me just above the ankle, so i suppose it is still do-able, but i hate to pay full price for something that doesn't fit quite right. maybe if it goes on sale i will consider it.",1
"Love the blue color. is a bit short, but fine with a tank underneath. i purchased the small, that's what i usually wear.",1
"Tried on this maxi dress recently, hoping i would have a new dress to enjoy but the frabic is just too thin. so sad :(. unfortunately it shows every lump and bump and even wearing spanx while trying on it still showed too much. a full length slip would help but i decided to put it back.",0
"Gorgeous color and great price, but too low cut and because of the design, a cami's wouldn't work. disappointed",0
"I bought this online. this looked like a sweater that was accidentally shrunk in the dryer, when i received it.

i will be returning this.",0
"This dress is very small in the bust and maxi length on short people (5'3"" 36dd). i can't wear a normal bra, i have to use adhesive pasties. the fabric is very smooth, thick and satin like, but fuzzes easily. mine came with minor thread pulls and one strap was sewn on twisted. the pattern in real life is very pink as opposed to the model sample which has more blue landscape. i'd like to hem the dress but i would sacrifice pattern. still very pretty dress. be sure to size up one or two depending",1
"I'm 5'8, 130 and the small fit very nice. i ordered on line and on one of the legs the elastic closure at the bottom snapped. got a new pair at the store. you can dress these up or down. they are fun.",1
"Great pair of pants to wear to work, and interview or out to lunch. i got so many compliments the first time i wore these. i'm 5'2"" i ordered the burgundy color in a size 0, regular which is what i normally wear and they fit fine. however they were just a tad big in the waist and a tad tight around my calves but other that they're a great pattern pant to have you wont be disappointed!",1
"I just received this in the mail and really enjoy it! it's a nice color and very gauzy/ airy. the only think i didn't love is that it's a little bit in the chest area, which is rare considering i'm usually a m in that area.",1
"Someone returned my size so i got to try it on in store. the cut is very flattering, the material is stretchy. the lace part is nicely made too. overall great piece. the petite waist did hit me a little higher than on model, i have a regular torso and short legs (and overall usually need petite)",1
I sized up based on other reviews which was good advice. i am typically a size 6 but sized up to a 10. the pants are very unique and i think on the right body type would look amazing. it seems like someone with curves and a small waist might fit these splendidly...but that's not me. i had some extra material puffing about in the zipper region. i also expected the material to be thicker but found it to be more silky.,0
"Got these in the red brick color, and unfortunately had to send them back. these are really cute and i loved the color and pattern, but they ran very small, and the cut between the legs and hips was odd. this may not have been a problem had i gone up at least one size. best to try them on if possible.",0
"So comfortable, great fit, dress it up with wedges, down with flats,
extremely soft and flattering. i normally wear a xs/s and the small fit perfectly. i'm 5'6"" and the length is just slightly cropped.",1
"Tried this romper on in store and wanted to love it but it just didn't fit me right. it'a great romper, cute design, super soft-light fabric and overall a great feel but it doesn't work to well for short girls with any types of hips. i have a very small waist and larger bottom and this romper just was very unflattering. i couldn't get the tie waist to sit anywhere that felt like my natural waist, instead it kept giving me a kangaroo pouch and hung on my upper thighs. sizing up didn't help becaus",1
I really liked this jumpsuit but it just wasn't perfect. the design at the top is a bit stiff compared to the rest of the jumpsuit. i felt the whole thing ran just slightly too large. it was nice - but not amazing.,1
"I wanted to love this sweater. the photo of the model makes it look so soft and warm. i liked the heavy texture and the extra long sleeves. however, after receiving this sweater i tried it on for less than 1 minute. one look in the mirror was enough to make me take it off and return it asap. the knit quickly expanding from small to large right over the bust, combined with the boxy shape was an atrocious combo. it must have added 30lbs to my physique and made my bust look matronly. yikes! this ma",0
"This dress is comfortable and versatile - one could wear it to the office or to a social event, day to night. i didn't find the sizing to run as large as some of the other reviewers did. i felt it was true to size. it is not lined so you would need a slip under it if you wear it with tights or nylons, otherwise the skirt will cling.",1
"Decent quality. i am 5'4"" 130 pounds. m is too big. runs slightly large.",1
"These pants are so fun. i love the pattern and color. can be dressed up or down. very flattering.
highly recommend trying them on, they were better than i expected them to be",1
This jumpsuit is great. i recently had a baby and am still trying to get the last 10 lbs of baby weight off and this jumpsuit is very forgiving and super comfortable. i'm usually a medium & i wasn't sure if i should size up. i ordered the medium and it was the right choice. great light material for summer and nice neckline.,1
I bought this today in a size 2. fits perfect. i am normally a 0 or 2 or xs. the top looks and fits exactly like the picture if you are small chested. because it is not long in the front. i think if you are larger chested the top will stick out too much and be too short in front. it is not super voluminous in front which is a good thing. it does have the volume in the back which gives it a cute shape. it is on the shorter side. very nice material and design as well as details. overall good pick.,1
"Beautiful patterns and colors, but it sits very high and runs small. i'm normally a size 4 and got the small. zipped all the way, but on the snug side. the skirt sits so high that the fabric coming down was a bit awkward. such a shame because it really is beautiful and looks great on the model probably because she's wearing a belt to hide how high it rides and flares out.",1
I loved this sweater when i saw it online and ordered right away. i purchased a s and the fit was very off. the arms were long (which i don't mind) but the sweater was also super heavy and bulky so it was not at all flattering. i really wanted to love it and it seemed to be of good quality but it i had to return it.,0
"This just wouldn't lay right on me. the top is really too big. maybe if you're really busty, this is great, but not for me. i know the top is supposed to be a bit blousy, but it was huge and droopy and unflattering (not like in the picture). the arm holes were too big and hung down so you could see my bra, which i really hate and which is way too common lately. the bottom half fit perfectly, so sizing up or down would not have helped. the material is super light and comfy, which i liked very muc",0
"This dress is stunning! my sister-in-law was hoping to use it as a bridesmaid dress for her wedding and i ordered it for fitting purposes. it fit beautifully on my 5'10"" frame. unfortunately she decided against it due to availability and because of the length on the shorter bridesmaids. while it fell to a couple inches above my ankles, it made the shorter girls look shorter. i ended up returning it but am regretting not keeping it now!",1
"This skirt is a nice medium weight and is lined. my normal size 4 fit perfect. i only wish it was available in petites. if you are petite, the skirt is ankle length. but this is a good skirt to wear to work.",1
"Runs large and pocket detail is very prominent. wanted a crisper, trouser-like pant--this is not it!",0
"The beadwork is gorgeous, but the sleeves are so puffy, it looks as though you're wearing shoulder pads. the fabric of the shirt isn't that fabulous either.",0
"This shirt is so great. it's beautiful and functional. i received countless compliments the first time i wore it. i'm looking forward to wearing it again! worth the steep price, though it was hard to justify.",1
"Very pretty blouse. it does run quite large, i am usually an xs-s or 0-4 and purchased the 0. i could probably have gone to a 00. for reference i am 5'4"" 118 lbs 34b/c. it says that it is dry clean only, however i washed in in delicate cycle with cold water and threw in the dryer for a little bit. it came out perfect! i was hoping to shrink it and it only shrunk a tiny bit. i was hoping for it to shrink more but it is fine. no need to even iron it! i was lucky enough to get it on sale, i don't t",1
The blue was a great color and i like the idea of a reversible top. however the xs was just swimming on me. this looks much more fitted in the pictures. my favorite workout top is from this brand and it is fitted and held up for 6 months. where are the fitted tops?? i'll keep looking.,0
This is not worth $128. it looks cute on but....there is no support in the bust area. just a slight tuck in the fabric -it also is very flowy which is great and it is comfortable but for the price and the thinness and lack of meatiness to the fabric itself i cannot recommend and will be returning. i'll look for something else. i haven't bought from retailer in a dogs age and i hope the quality hasn't slipped - i will look for another option.,0
"I've been adoring this online and while in store i happened upon this blouse and tried it on. the material was sturdy and the beading oh-so lovely, but on my frame it looked terrible. (i normally wear size m/10 in retailer clothes). as another reviewer mentioned, this blouse has rather puffy sleeves which aren't evident in the photo of the model. as well, i also didn't love the collar, which doesn't quite lay flat. if i were to buy this i would have to wait for it to go on sale and then get the po",0
"Extremely disappointed with this top. it runs extremely large. i'm 5'2, 130 lbs, 34c and usually wear between a 0-2 & xs-s tops at retailer. i ordered a 0 and it looked like a maternity top on me. the bottom half of the top flared out and did not fit close to the body at all. fabric was also a gauze-like material that was not soft. unfortunately, i will be returning.",0
"Tried this lovely with high waste, wide leg, black flowy pants. everything i could hope for and more, but not quite!

size: blindly ordered size 6. i'm usually a small, occasionally xs in retailer brands like floreat and akemi+kin. i'm 5'5"" tall, 130 lbs, 34d, 35-29-37, long torso, narrow shoulders, and short arms.

fit: size 6 had just enough space through the bust. the lace edged sleeves were roomy and just reached my wrists. the shoulders were just right. extra fabric ballooned out around t",0
"Fabric is soft, body runs a bit big but falls nicely. length is great for leggings or skinny jeans. overall, wonderful tee shirt!",1
"I was glad that i was able to get this shirt which is really more of a spring/summer item, but i found it wide in the body and the shoulders.",1
"It's hard to go wrong with the charlie's, especially in this fabric, keep them coming!! i wrote a review on the brush strokes as well. they fit pretty true to size, i'd say try both your usual size and one size down as well, they stretch out a little, so if they feel a little tight keep that in mind. because of the texture of these pants you can wear so many more colors than just usual black and white trouser fabric. try wearing a burnt orange, green, or pink (the isabella sinclair grid wrap but",1
Can't go wrong with these new charlie's by cartonnier. they fit amazingly. the fabric is a textured cotton but doesn't seem to wrinkle. just shook them out of the bag yesterday. the fabric description says cotton and spandex so they have some give (just a little) but are not going to stretch out after wearing for an hour. paired it with all sorts of different tops. side zip is slimming. lined pockets. substantial fabric. nothing bad to say. if you haven't tried a pair of charlies you should. you,1
"Ordered the pink in a small, but it ran big...the xs was perfect for my 5'6' medium frame. it is comfortable and the fabric has an interesting texture. looks great with chinos or jeans. might need to get the other color.",1
"So i actually loved this skirt (the tea rose color and coppery gold buttons were perfect together) and it's rare to find something that's simultaneously so form-fitting and comfortable.... but i hold a lot of my weight in my butt and thighs, and i just felt like it was a little too sexy for work (especially with that long slit - i might feel differently if it didn't have that slit, because then i could at least pair it with a cute oversized cardigan to tone things down a bit for the office). if",1
"Very cute top but runs very very big ! im5 ft 5 in tall, 120 lbs. i ordered the xs but it was so big it looked like a maternity top.. sadly returned the top. otherwise the top was made of good quality fabric.",0
"I have been eyeing this piece for months now! i broke down and bought it when they finally had my size in stock. i am 5 '4 and 110 lbs and have a very small chest so i ordered an xs. i think the top is too baggy for me. yes, the top and bottoms fit overall, but it doesn't look as nice and form fitting like it does on the model. it is very sheer--which is the thing that discourages me the most. i love the concept of this piece but the execution could use some work, which i am willing to work on s",0
"This top is everything i wanted it to be. the fabric is beautiful, and the fit is flowy and comfortable. i would love to own a u-neckline version.",1
"I expected the waist to be cinched like it appears on the model but it isn't. i ordered the xs and i'm swimming in it (i'm 5'4"" and 120 lb). would suggest ordering a few sizes down to avoid looking like you're wrapped in grandma's table runner.",0
"I really wanted to love this shirt. the fit was great, and the fabric just felt beautiful. luxurious, soft and flowing. but the collar was frayed... in addition, the little keyhole area fabric also had to be carefully handled to make it look smooth and not like bad workmanship. i put it aside to return it, then this morning went to have another look at it, wanting to talk myself back into it. but i can't overlook the fact i'd be ordering a new shirt that would look time-worn. it may be only this",0
"This cardi is cuter in the stock photos. in person, the colors are a bit more drab. stock photos also don't show quite how much of a swing shape this has. it is very soft, though. returned it!",0
The material is cheap and looks torn. not as nice as the picture.,0
"Adorable foxes, i was smitten in the store but the fix is bizarre and the foxes don't come up very high so you're limited in the length you can wear. i bought the m/l based on salesperson advice and i can't imagine trying anything smaller, i usually wear a size s or 4 bottom, these were super snug. back to the store they went.",0
"I am short, on the heavy side. 5'1"" 156 lbs. i always wear large petite. this beautiful blouse swallows me. lots of fabric on the front side of the shirt, causing a boxy look. i could totally do a mp if not sp. i am going to try and exchange..
beautiful blouse, great quality, breathable fabric. colors are deep and rich. so comfy.. highly recommend.",1
"This sweater is thicker and darker than it appears online. i thought it would be more of a blush color, but it's more dark gray and brown. it wasn't that flattering on me as a cardigan. looked a little cuter all buttoned up, but ultimately i am not keeping because of the color.",0
"I have this top in orange and white. it is a great top to throw on with jeans. don't put it in the dryer, will shrink.",1
"The material is more like a great tee for the sleeves and the back, so it is so comfortable. i agree with the previous review, i am not thrilled about the hook and eye, but it still looks cute with a tank under it. i bought it in black and i am ordering it as well in white. it looks great with skinny jeans or pants.",1
"This is a very cute, casual sweater. i originally ordered a size medium but i had to send it back because it was way too large all over. i recently received the size small and i'm going to keep it. it is still a roomy fit but the overall design of the sweater is a relaxed fit. the color combination and texture of this sweater is lovely.",1
"Nice fabric, great color, would be lovely ... on someone with a straight-and-narrow body type. for ladies with curves, take a pass--too much like maternity wear, and not in that elegantly slouchy kind of way. the straight-up ""is she or isn't she"" kind of way.",0
These fox tights are so very cute and fun! how can you not smile when wearing these tights designed with the cutest foxes all over! they are warm too! these go great under dresses or tunics and i always get compliments when wearing them! they are a real attention getter!,1
"Note to photographers: please don't cinch the wait of a blouse to make something look tailored when it isn't. this could have been a real win if it had been more simply executed. i'm petite, way too much fabric. returned.",0
"Lovely embroidery with a classic look, great addition to your wardrobe.",1
"At first, i thought this top was going to be stiff. i am pleasantly surprised by how soft and flowy this blouse is. it's lovely cream color with beautiful lace details. i appreciate the lining inside the bodice which means i can potentially go bra-less when it's hot! i'm 5'2'', 135lb and retailer size s usually gives me plenty of room because i have a small upper body. but i feel this top is slight short on me. that might be because i didn't wear it off-the-shoulder but had it hang from the top of",1
"This skirt was horrible on me. it was loose in the waist, tight in the hips and poofed out like crazy at the tiered part on the bottom. the material also felt cheap and clingy. i guess the fit is tts, but it's hard to tell given how strange the cut was.",0
"I just received my duster . i love it! the coat is as pictured. the fabric is medium weight denim with some stretch. it feels like a denim coat that you have worn for years. i'm 5'8"" and the duster hits mid-calf. i'm a curvy size 14-16 and the xl fits perfectly. the only issue that might arise is that the sleeves are long; they fit me perfectly but i have long arms. this will be my new go to coat for fall.",1
"The design is graceful and both my kids said it was a keeper ""pretty,"" even the boy child.

somehow i feel it makes my tummy look bigger than it is, maybe with the belt on my jeans.",1
A cute top. slightly tight in the upper area. debated returning but decided to keep as the top is unique and i know that i will wear it frequently. aleardy thinking of way to wear all year around! runs small,1
"I ordered this in my usual size 0 and couldn't finish zipping up the top, but also couldn't fill in the boobs. i am 5'7, 116 lbs, 32a. it is very cute, but the top was pretty stiff and unless it draped on you correctly, could probably be bothersome. i was disappointed in the quality of the skirt- no lining, simple cotton/polyester. i will probably return, try the size up, but was disappointed compared to how excited i was for it. i did like that it had pockets, and would be a fun dress to wear f",0
"Timeless skirt. just don't like the placement of the slit, so maybe i'll sew it up.",1
"I was so excited about this skirt and pairing it with a cute blouse for the warmer weather. as i took out the skirt out of the package and flipped it around, the back has mesh strips that are see through! there is also no lining to go with this skirt. if you go back to the ""back view"" picture on the website and zoom in closely, you can see the model's black underwear.",0
"I love the style of this dress, but unfortunately, it runs very small. i normally wear a size 8. i ordered a 10 and the dress was closer to a size 6. disappointed that i had to return it. also, the seams were poorly done and threads hung out everywhere on the hem.",0
"This dress did not work for me. i tried it in my bigger size 6 since i am coming off winter weight gain. the dress fit tts but was squishing the breasts like tight bandages. i have smaller chest and the stretch bodycon fabric of the bodice made me look flat-chested. the straps did not sit flat on shoulders, i assume because they were not pulled tight enough by the chest. the dress was uncomfortable and felt strange on. but i can see how others with more curves on top will love the support of the",0
"I get so many compliments with this skirt! i love almost everything about it. i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because i find the slit a little annoying. i think it's maybe a little too long (or short, i can't figure it out) but i couldn't pass up this skirt because the pattern is so pretty.

fits true to size, soft fabric, very cute.",1
"The dress was great! the zipper was just a little tough but over all a very classic, feminine piece.",1
"/my friend and i both tried on this shirt just to see how it fit and because it was blue. we were surprised how pretty it si on. a little see-through though, but hte cut hits in the right places (i guess we are not too endowed). she ended up buying it so i passed but very feminie work piece.",1
"I thought from the picture this would be a light floaty top. when it arrived, the fabric was a heavy knit and the neckline sagged very low. on me (granted i'm a pear) the bottom layer hugged my tummy and rear in a very unflattering way. the only thing i liked was the color. back it went.",0
"Tried this on at my local retailer, the red color is pretty but not a ""true"" red. the fabric has a nice weight to it not the usual thin stuff that retailer seems to offer these days. two big problems though- the top is very low cut and i could see it ""opening"" up to the world! and the armholes are cut so big and low that you could see the sides of my bra, this is a deal-breaker for me, it can't be fixed.",0
"This skirt is everything i love about retailer. the fit, style and quality are amazing. i feel like a am wearing a piece of art. it is so unique and fits perfectly. way to go retailer!!",1
"This is one of the best date night tops i've seen in a while. i'm 5'6, 120 lbs and the xs is perfect. the fit is spot on and the fabric feels nice. i will need a teeny tiny safety pin to keep the front closed, but i do that often so i don't see it as a design flaw.",1
"Despite being a knit, this skirt holds its shape and is absolutely perfect. it goes with everything and is extremely comfortable.",1
"The color, design and fabric of this top (got it in the red) were just as i expected, but as the owner of several deletta brand tops, i was very surprised to find that my usual size small runs very large in this tank. not only did the front dip too low but so did the arm holes, and the top just hangs on me. it was so big for a small that it almost made me think it had been mislabeled and was really a size large. 
bummed to return it because i really love the color and the style. will try an x-s",0
"Super flattering! my mom and i both bought this, and we have very different body types. (we both had to size up a bit, as i have a large chest, and she has a large ribcage.) i got a size 10 (i'm normally a size 8), and she got a 12. it was much easier to zip up without bras on, and it seems to have been designed to not need a bra. my mom is pretty short (5""2'), so she's going to get her straps shortened. for reference, i'm about 5'9"". hope this helps!",1
"Based on previous reviews i ordered this shirt in both a small and medium. i have fairly broad shoulders, and thought i might not fit my usual small (if it helps for reference, i am 5'6"", 123 lbs, and wear a 32c bra). i first tried on the small and didn't even bother opening the medium. i have a hard time finding blouses that fit in the torso without pulling at the bust (i think this is more related to my wide shoulders as opposed to actual bra size). with this blouse the buttons don't pull at a",1
"This dress is made of a very thick material both on the top and bottom, making it very flattering. lots of compliments!",1
"This shirt was so weird?it does not fit like the photo at all. there seems to be missing a stitch or something at the top as it is wide open until the bottom/where it meets the other layer. i could wear a tank/camisole underneath, but it still just did not fit right. i do not have a large chest, but this was ridiculous. beyond that, the red color was just okay. even though i purchased this on sale, it was not worth the price and i returned.",0
"I saw this dress and immediately started daydreaming about wearing it while honeymooning in italy along the amalfi coast or the cinque terre with my husband. and then i tried this dress on and immediately woke up. the cut is a disaster, the quality is terrible, and the dress just plain didn't work. the strips of elastic were sewn unevenly, giving the appearance that there was one large breast and one non-existent breast. the neckline was so long that it had to have the elastic run over the outsi",0
"Right out of the bag, this top didn't really match the one pictured here (it is the right top, though). the fabric was heavy and felt ""damp"" -- the way something feels coming out of the wash. very odd.
and the fit is nothing like what's shown on the model. the ""v"" is not fitted or nicely wrapped (or even tacked in place) -- it was just two loose, droopy pieces so most of my bra was showing no matter how many times i put the pieces back where they belonged (i'm neither ""flat chested"" nor ""busty""",0
I was surprised and impressed by how well made this top is. it looks and feels expensive and of good quality. it is a very flattering fit for someone like me who is small on top and wider at the hips area. i look forward to wearing this top all through the fall/winter/holiday seasons!,1
"This romper is cute, well-made and true to size, but i haven't figured it out how to put this on without having someone tie the back ties. which pretty much means that going to the bathroom is not an option while you have this romper on. not sure what the designers were thinking here. i'm returning this one.",0

"These are the most comfortable pants i own. i bought them in the gold, green, and gray (which really does look more like a grayish purple). the gold is my favorite - it goes with so many things! i was just checking to see if there were any other colors - would love them in black and a burgundy. i'm about 125 lbs,, 5 foot 7, and the 28 is a perfect fit. the saleswoman warned that they would stretch out, but i haven't found that to be a real problem.",1
"Love these pants! super comfortable, but feel high quality. i am usually a size 2 and the xs fits perfectly.",1
"I really wanted to like this dress and was so disappointed when it came in the mail. if you have any sort of hips, the light pattern in the middle doesn't do you any favors. this made my hips look soooo wide! and the seaming and gathering in the middle was just off. if it was one continuous piece of fabric it might look better. with the seam, the pattern was cut up and looked pieced together. that just drew too much attention to my stomach and hips. it had to go back.",0
"I am almost always an xs in bottoms (sz 0-2) but literally couldn't get the stretchy waistband (no zip or fastening) in xs up my hips. in addition, the ""brocade"" is a very lightweight polyestery, tinselly weave--does not suggest quality. as others have noted, it also runs short; i'm 5'3'' and this was a little below knee length on me, not ankle-length. i've had luck with retailer's sale section in the past, including some items that didn't always start off with the best reviews, but have no regret",0

but how did i not see that this has tassels? but they're there, a whole row of them - look hear the bottom of the skirt part, between the colorful stripes and the lacy area. that's a deal breaker for me - i really can't stand the way these look, and they're not the sort of thing you can easily remove.

the fabric, though nice quality, has no stretch at all. i wasn't expecting stretch, but i'd just say",0
This might be one of my new go to tops. looks cute with jeans and a sweater or alone. the arms are snug but not uncomfortable and i think it adds to the shirt.,1

"I can't get enough of maxi dresses and i can't resist tracy reese. this stunning dress caught my eye immediately, but i was worried that the back cut out at the waist would make my backside look flatter. i'm so glad i took the plunge to buy before it sold out. this dress fits perfectly, it's flattering to my figure, the print is beautiful, the fabric and drape do not cling to my figure flaws and i'm just so happy! for sizing reference here are my stats: 5'3"" 140# 36dd and i purchased the medium",1
"True to size. length is perfect for 5'8""-5'9"". soft fabric. not too low cut in the front, but not all covered up either. ruching is subtle and does not add bulk. skirt portion skims curves, neither clinging to them nor poufing out from them. strap design is perfect, covers bra while revealing a touch of skin. comfortable and effortless to wear, very very pretty.",1

I was pleasantly surprised when this arrived. it hangs in a flattering way and the red has a nice soft hue. i couldn't believe what a great deal i got while on sale.,1

"I am just over 5'8""and i found that these pants hit me in a weird spot on my torso, almost creating a muffin top that i don't normally have. in addition, they were too short on me to give the chic and modern look of cropped ankle pants. on my frame, they fit more like capris from the late 1990s. both the construction and execution of the pants are otherwise fantastic.",0
Love these pants. super light and great color. they are a bit long though,1

"Short and wide. the color and print are so pretty, but the shape isn't flattering, at least not to me. might work better on a teen?",0
"Kicky looking pants, that i got at a bargain basement steal. i'd be kicking myself if i didn't buy them. can't wait to wear them once it warms up. they'll look great with a lightweight, boxy sweater and flats. i tried on the 4 and the 2 and the 2 is perfect. the fabric has a nice, fluid feel to it. i always swore to my husband i'd never wear plaids, but i guess i lied.",1
"I'm keeping this blouse anyway. i purchased the olive and it's such a great color. i live in a warm climate and really don't need long sleeves, but since the color is so great and pairs well with a lot, i will keep it.",1
"These pants are exactly what i expected. true to size and color were perfect! they feel so good to wear and love the detail in the sewing. perfect office attire or night out for dinner. just add a fancier blouse. ta da :)
would highly recommend them.",1
"These pants are so great. i am 5'10 and the talls are actually a hair too long. but no complaints! just wish they made every color available in tall. i had been waiting for new colors to get a second pair and was disappointed they are only offered in regular length. but overall these pants are super comfortable and great for work. as far as sizing goes, i wear a 29 in the pilcro cord leggings and wear a 12 in these.",1
"This dress looks lovely on the model, but it looks just awful on me!
i am 5'4"" and curvy. the shoulders are cut w/ a weird shape. instead of a cap sleeve, it is like a pointy cap on the side and stuck out on my shoulders. it looks like i am ready to get beamed into space.
the material is nice and the sequins are pretty, but the cut of the dress is unflattering.",0
"These are great quality and hang very nice. tts. i'm 5'6"" and about 130lbs and the 2 fit and hit just above the ankle.",1
I ordered the neutral in a 2p. i had to hem them. i 5' about 110lbs. i wore them to wore. they wore beautifully with some wrinkling to be expected with linen. but they didn't look like i slept in them. i ordered another pair same size right after the first pair came and tried them on to find the fit tighter than the first pair. a bit disappointed. debating if they'll stay or get returned. i see the notes about stretching. overall a nice pant for the money.,1
"It's pretty, floaty, feminine; the photos don't do justice to the prettiness. but the photos also don't show an asymmetrical hem. i understood it runs small so i got two sizes, to be safe, and even my larger size was strangely short-waisted, and i'm short-waisted to start with. maybe i could've lived with that, but both the dresses i received have an uneven hem unlike any i've ever worn or seen before. it's not longer on just the sides; the hem is longer in one spot on the front, and one in the",0
"I ordered this in a size s, my usual size and it fits great. i love the color, style and fit of the dress. the only criticism i can think of is the braided trim on the skirt hits right at my hip and kind of, ever so slightly, poofs out a bit and i wish it had pockets. other than that it's pretty darn cute and i got it at a great price of under $40. so i will wear it as much as i can until it gets cooler. because of the rich color, i can probably wear with cute sweater and booties into the fall!",1
"This is a great basic t that works with shorts, pants, or a skirt.",1
"Such a cute skirt- but impossible to get on. ordered in an xs (i have a 25/26 waist) but could barely get it past my knees to step into. if you have any hips at all, unfortunately this skirt won't work. i was tempted to size up but once i got it on it fit great in the waist and already had too much material to size up to a small.",0
"It was very pretty,but it ran very big , sadly i had to return it.",0
"I thought this dress was very cute on the model, however it was way too tight across the chest for me. going up a size would mean it would be too roomy everywhere else. also, fabric wasn't great.",0
"I've had my eye on this for awhile, glad it was still in stock.  really great deep wine color, soft.  more texture and detail than i had appreciated in the picture.  love.",1
Ugh.  i was so excited to get this dress and for 30% off.  this dress is adorable.  unfortunately the top part is super tight around my girls.  otherwise the fit was perfect.  very disappointed in the top of this dress.,0
You will love this cardigan. very well made with beautiful details. the sleeves have the same detail as the collar and the back. has darker flecks that will go well with dark pants or cords or jeans. you will love this cardi! wish it came in more springy colors. i only gave it a lower rating for quality because the first one i tried on had a sleeve that was much tighter than the other sleeve. the replacement was fine!!,1
Cute skirt but i agree with the other reviewer. you can't get it on! i tried my skinny daughter tried no go!,0
"I would definitely only recommend this top to girls who are smaller chested. it fits in the shoulders/arms, and then flares out too much at the bottom, almost looks like a maternity top. the material is very nice however - both soft, and feels like it will hold up through multiple washes.",0
"This looked like such a cute, casual skirt when i picked it up but like other reviewers have said, it runs small. i'm usually a xs in retailer skirts but they only had a small to try on. i was able to get it on but did notice it was snug pulling on past my hips. however once on, i couldn't figure out how i'd wear this. i wouldn't pair this with a flowy top but tucking something in didn't seem like a good idea either. between the pleats and elastic waist it will make almost anyone look like they ha",0
I thought it was only me and immediately assumed i needed to go on a diet when i attempted to put this adorable skirt on. it got stuck at my hips. i'm a very consistent size small in dresses and skirts. i actually thought about putting it on over my head but that was impossible. its going back. now i see the other reviews and am relieved that its the skirt and not me! wish i had read them before purchasing. retailer is going to get a lot of returns on this one.,0
"Facing the mirror--near perfection. high waist emphasizes the narrowest part of the frame--pleats nicely hide any stomach flaws. color is an eye-catching deep mustardy perfection and the interlocking button pattern is creative and beautiful. the problem is the walk away. from that view, the skirt waist finishes just where there's a bit of extra flesh. the cut is more of a long a-line--fairly boxy--and the heaviness of the cotton maintains that structure, so while the look as you approach walking",0
"I'm: 34a, 125 lbs, 5'8""
purchased: small

i was going back and forth between xs and s. i decided on small because it fit better in my arms, didn't feel as tight. the xs fit well in the torso area and didn't have as much fabric as the small. the small also had a longer shirt tail. 

if you don't have as much mass in the arms, get the xs. if you have some muscle or extra mass in the arms, it's better to go with the small.",1
"Cute design with interesting details. i felt it ran a bit large. i'm 5'8"", 135 lbs, an 8 was too big and baggy. my biggest complaint with this skirt is the color. it's just not flattering.",1
"This skirt is very pretty, but not only does it run small but only a small portion of the waistband is elasticized, so there's very little stretch. for those of us with a significant difference in our waist and hip measurements, there's no way to get this skirt on past the hips.",0
"This skirt is beautiful...the color is definitely more a greeny-gold then a true yellow gold...nice quality fabric, has some stretch, big pockets with cute lining, buttons are adorable, perfect knee length, sits higher on the waist. because it's not lined and the pockets are big, the pocket line is visible on my thigh area, so i am going up a size just so i don't see that...if you have less curves, your regular size should be perfect. it has so much character, but it!!",1
"1. i'm 5'5"" tall, 145 lbs, and 38-32-40. i'm normally a size 10, but i took a 12 in this skirt.

2. it's comfortable and has pockets that you can really put your hands in.

3. sits at high waist. hem hits below the knee.

4. i didn't like the buttons. they are very round and stick out quite far. they are also mismatched. i would have liked them better if they were flatter.

5. i also didn't like the mustard color. it's unflattering to me.",1
"This is a great basic tee (purchased in navy) but fits much larger than it appears on the model. the arms/chest area fit fine but it really billows out below. the front is shorter and the back is longer than i would've expected. i thought this would be great for summer, but it's really too long in the back to wear with shorts. it does, however, look great with skinny jeans.",1
"I adore this dress, the perfect summer dress that you can dress up or down. the color is vibrant and the fabric flows and feels fantastic against your skin. i love that you can still wear a strapless bra with it, but with the adjustable shoulder ties you can have it go as low as you want for a more sexy look. the bottom hem is this super cute fringe, so fun and feminine. and while it is a loose fitting dress i did not feel like my figure was drowned out by the fullness of the fabric. this dress",1
I agree with the other reviews - runs small. would have been perfect if it actually was comfortable. waistband doesn't stretch all the way around. bummer.,0
Great piece just wish it fit a bit more blousy rather than cami,1
"This top! it is so simple, but so great at the same time! it does run large, and i'm not a skinny girl... but it has a style that is certainly meant to flow away from the body as it goes down. i find the top portion very flattering and the looser bottom section doesn't take away from that. i have been wearing the olive green with fitting dark jeans and a flannel or oversized soft, washed-jean button down shirt over it for the cool spring weather. it's casual, but so comfy. it's great for loungin",1
"What an adorable and frustrating skirt! i'm not a large person: 32d-26-36. and i ordered my normal size small. this is a pull on skirt, and the waist opening could not accommodate either my shoulders or my hips. in most retailer clothes, i'm either a size 2 or 4; i have to agree with the other reviewer. there is no way to put this item on.",0
"This sweater was huge, it hung down to my calves! it also is really bulky and scratchy, it feels as if you are wearing an old wool blanket. i think it is only made for really tall and skinny people. i'm 5'2"" and weigh 120lbs. and i ordered a size s, and i was swimming in it. the fabric is very thick, i may be great if you live in alaska or the arctic. it adds about 20lbs to your body frame.......",0
"So stunning, i had to have it for my spring wardrobe! fits true to size and fits well in the bust and is looser on the bottom. the model weara it just as it fits on me. if you have a large bust you may need to size up as the fabric isn't stretchy.",1
Material is hard to wear a bra under it,0
"Loved the way these felt but like the previous reviewer said it did run slightly large. i am usually a size 6 or m and the legs were a little baggy w/the medium. since the m is sold out i'm going to try and see if they shrink in the dryer. the color and design of the ankle is different from other leggings which is a plus. i'm 5'7"" and they are the perfect length.",1
"Beautiful dress! perfect mid length dress for the colder months. i tried a size 2 regular first (my normal dress size) but it was a little baggy, so the 0 fit perfectly.",1
The pleats on the bib make this look like something from chloe sevigny's wardrobe on the set of big love. and the shoulders are cut for an offensive lineman.,0
"I absolutely love this dress. i feel it's the perfect year-round piece. looks super cute with boots or booties. even with a cute baggy sweater over it. i am usually a small or medium, depending on brand. i'm a small with this one. and i actually like it worn without the button fastened in the back, it just worked better that way. it is not see-thru, though is a light material. i live in fl so i can wear year round. but up north, with tights and boots, you can too. so worth the price!",1
"Nice but i thought these ran big. me: 28-29' waist, 36"" hips, athletic thighs. usually a medium in leggings but these size mediums were a bit baggy to my surprise. hoping to exchange for a size down as they are pretty, the ankle detail is fun and decently made.",1
"I got the pink color, which is really vibrant and beautiful in person. this top is low cut, so if you don't like to show much cleavage plan to wear it over a cami.

i'm 5'5 145lbs, 37-29-39. got a size medium. it fits okay in the bust area, but is much looser than i would prefer below the bust. i will either return or exchange for a small to see if the fit is better.",1
"Very flattering, not too short, beautiful. i'm 5.6, 36d, usually wear m in dresses, wide hips. the 8 fit very nicely.",1
"As one would expect from boucle, this sweater is incredibly soft, warm and cozy without being heavy. i fell in love with it when i first saw it and got it in white color. it's beautiful, goes with casual and work clothing (belt helps with the latter styling), and it didn't leave lint on the dark skirt i wore with it to work! i usually wear xs or s and found this sweater to be still roomy in xs, with sleeves being a bit long. i hope it won't stretch with wear as boucles sometimes do - that's my o",1
"There is a lot of fabric here! the legs fit me fine, but they are long and when you roll them up it creates a bunching of fabric in an awkward area. i've also found that they don't stay rolled up in the back, especially if you sit down. it's a shame since the fabric is soft and comfortable. maybe sizing down would've helped, but i doubt that would've fixed the problem of the cuffs staying rolled up.",0
Gorgeous dress! fits true to size with high quality material. the colors are stunning.,1
"Even on sale, this was just too pricey for what it is, which is a glorified tank. i liked the straps, but it hangs very wide off your chest.",0
"I wrote item ran large, but that was true only in length. it would be long for someone 5'10"" . however the bigger issue is getting it on. the style and quality are quite nice, but it does have some issues.",0
"I'm so happy to add this lovely and unusual dress to my fall wardrobe. i absolutely fell in love with it the moment i tried it on. i wear a two or four, depending on the designer, and the two fit me perfectly. another reviewer said it's special occasion only, but i like it so much, i'll wear it more often. with that said, it's a wonderful go-to dress for the holiday season.",1
"I love the colors of this dress, and i waited for the sale since it isn't really good for work. i wear size 6 in hd all the time, but this one doesn't fit at all on the top. the bust is cut for someone really curvy, but the bottom is for someone really straight. i don't know what they were using for a model, but this has to be tried on before purchased. the material is also rough, and there is no lining to protect you from that. i love my hd dresses for style and functionality, but this one is j",0
"This dress is so cute. i love that it has pockets. it looks great with sandels, and also ballet flats. it is airy, and run true to size. i wear a small, and it fit perfect. i even bought the other navy, and cream dress. you will wear this dress over, and over. just roll up the sleeves, and throw it on, and your ready. just love it!!!!",1
"I loved the aesthetic but as a true hourglass shape, i was frustrated that it didn't have a little more give as i tried to pull it over my head. the fabric was stiff, and seemed to be lace over cotton? not entirely sure. i couldn't get past the feeling off the material.",0
"Went to the store in search of a butter dish. tried this dress on a was shocked at how comfortable, versatile and all over appealing this dress is. i'm 5'10"" and the medium hits at my knees.  as always i think the quality could be better. it's not something that will last for years.",1
"I saw this top on sale and tried it on right away. my normal medium was too big, so i purchased the small in the rose color. wore it with a shimmery kimono and cream colored pilcro boyfriend jeans. wow, what an outfit!!!!
then i washed it according to directions, and sadly it shrunk into a crop peplum tank. i was so disappointed. i wished i had read the reviews beforehand.",0
"This is my second dress from this designer. it is very comfortable, stylish, and looks great with sandals/wedges. i would have given it 5 stars but the neckline was a little lower than i expected and the length was a little longer. i am still keeping it though and expect to wear it spring, summer, and fall.",1
I purchased this based on previous reviews. the quality of the dress and the print is excellent. the dress fit me perfect in the front however there were so much extra fabric in the back that it made me look extremely large. i understand it's a shirt dress however the back would need to be taken in like 6 inches. for someone who is looking for a more boxy full coverage dress this is more for them,0
"I wear a size 4 and i ordered the small for this top. it is huge and gave me a maternity-look that i wasn't going for. i was hoping for a loose, body-skimming fit as shown on the model in the picture but that wasn't happening with this top.",0
"Love this sweater! the abstract floral design adds an understated romantic touch, the red is a beautiful rich red, and the cotton is super soft and comfy. i've tried it on with pencil skirts and jeans, and it looks great with both. i'm considering buying it in the off white too, but it does have some cons. one is the waist band hits me where it does on the model and if you look closely you can see where the sweater poof out over the band a bit--it does that on me too, unless i turn the band up t",1
"I am totally in love with this sweater!! it is lightweight, comfortable, and very versatile. throw on a pair of jeans and it is casual. throw on dark slacks or a skirt and it is dressy. the design does not become the focus of the sweater but rather takes it up a notch making it a fun piece to wear. the color is not a light red, but rather a rich cabernet wine color. this sweater is well on its way to becoming one of my all time favorites!!",1
I really loved the colors in this dress and was looking for a long sleeve dress. this style may just be big fitting but the sleeves were way too long and the dress was just shapeless on me. i usually wear a small or a size 4 in clothing and the size small in this dress was way too big. the x-small may have been a better fit but this dress was on backorder and i just received it right before we are going on a trip. there's no time to order the x-small but maybe i can look at it again when we retu,1
"Super cute, flattering design but the material is itchy so it's going back:(",0
"This will be a favorite sweater this winter. it has a loose but flattering fit. i purchased the red (a deep rusty red), and it fits me exactly as it does the model pictured...slightly loose but flattering, mid hip, open neckline. you can't tell in the picture, but the neckline is rolled. i am 5'2"", 140 lbs., just a bit fluffy. the small fits me perfectly. i think that you could size down from your regular size if you prefer a closer fit. the sleeves are at the top of my hands, just below the wri",1
Looks great in the picture but when i got this in the mail the fabric was so stiff! shaking it out did nothing-almost like it was dipped in drying glue. i got this for $10 which is so cheap and i still returned it!,0
"This tank runs very true to size. i ordered my usual size 8, which fits like a glove. couldn't go any smaller. very pretty fabric which is lined above the peplum. i personally like the higher peplum, but it's a personal choice. great purchase!",1
"This was a christmas gift to my sister. she liked it so much she wore it the day after opening it. very cute design, lovely deep red color. only thing to look out for is the potential of fabric to snag - looks like it may do so easily if wearing long jewelry. may run a bit large, but the medium for her well (slightly loose fitting garment). she is 5'7 and would probably wear a large in a typical shirt.",1
"I tried this jacket on and it was definitely cute but a couple things to note. it's a wool acrylic blend and it was already starting to pill from being tried on in the store. also, it's unlined. i thought the price point was high given its fibers and unlined. given its hem, i wonder how much longevity the piece has and how quickly it might start to look dated too.",0
"This dress looked super cute in the picture and on the model. i ordered the petite style and it was still so big and way too loose. no shape whatsoever! i unfortunately had to return it. i love loose dresses but this one was way too big, loose and had no shape at all.",0
This will be a great summer staple.  good fit and very comfortable.  may go back and buy another color,1
"This dress is a vintage 20s drop hem style, not meant to be tight to form.  that said, the bottom is loose so may want to size down.  5'2, 145 lbs= s.  i bought the neutral- navy pattern and it is absolutely gorgeus!  hints of peach and beautiful lace detail.  i literally got compliments all day long- from friends and strangers.  i paired it with a dark denim jacket.  absolute must have for sale price.",1
"I purchased this top in the rose and steel blue colors even though the majority of reviews says it shrinks even when you wash per the instructions. i called the local retailer store first to see if it could be returned if this happened and they said yes, no problem. well the reviews are correct. i washed just the rose colored top so i could compare it to the steel blue if it did shrink. i am returning them this evening. i will not take the time or spend the money to dry clean a tank. it is made ve",0
"This dress is very flattering. i am writing a review to share my experience regarding sizing. i am 5'7"" and wear 34a.  i tried on a size 0 that was at the store as a return and there was about a 3 inch gap to get the side zip closed. although i  normally wear a size 2, i ordered size 4 because of my experience with the dress at the store.  the size 4 is slightly big across the bust but looks ok. i think the size 2 would've been too tight.",1
Love this sweater! great for work. very soft and comfortable. color is gorgeous!,1
"Super thick material and it's lined with cotton so as not to be scratchy on the skin. it looks cute on, hopefully it will soften over time. almost thick like upholstery fabric.",1
"I've already worn this dress 4 times and i bought 3 weeks ago. easy to wear, comfortable and flattering. i love and wish it was available it more patterns.",1
"I was really drawn to this burgundy color on this sweater, but wasn't all that impressed with the style. as soon i tried it on, wow it is very flattering. the color is gorgeous, i can see myself using it with jeans, pencil skirts, pants. for reference it does run large, i am usually a x large but i got a large and fits beautifully.",1
Has anybody washed this shirt a second time? just curious if it continues to shrink.,0
"I love, love, love this absolutely stunning dress. the only problem was that the zipper was very difficult to maneuver, and when it finally went up, the watch it was attached the lining of the dress made a bump in the dress, which was very unflattering on an otherwise very flattering dress. i tried on multiple versions of this dress and had the same design issue with each. i ended up returning it because it bothered me so much.",0
"Purchased because i wanted a deep red sweater, and this one was the perfect color. unfortunately i am on the curvier side, with 34g chest, 155lbs 5' 5"", and the med was too big, (i usually wear m or l at retailer.) also the fit ended up being boxy on my body type.",0
I own many retailer dresses but the sizing can be odd. i usually wear a size 4-6 and i have a floreat maxi dress size 4 that works well. i am 34c and based on the reviews i decided to order a size 6. the dress fits well except for he bust area that is very snug/couldn't even get the zipper up. i will probably have to order a size 10 to be able to close the zipper on the bust area but it will be huge everywhere else.the fabric seems very delicate and may develop runs easily. it's a shame because th,0
"I got this coat to throw over slacks at work with the ac, and it's perfect. the picture online is less flattering than in person. found that the medium was too large in shoulders and arm length, small was right for 140lb, 5'8"", typical size 6.",1
"This dress is adorable. i found it to be true to size, but i do have a small bust so perhaps that helped with the sizing issue the other reviewer encountered. i love the embroidery throughout, it beautifully constructed and feels lush. i'm 5'9"" and the dress falls to my ankles, but that's ok because it will look beautiful with heels or flats. i love the dress and cant wait to wear but gave it a 4-star rating because of the side zipper. it is extremely hard to zip up past your waist because of th",1
"I fell in love with this cute top, however after reading reviews, i am going to return it. seems there is a problem with it shrinking after following washing instructions. who wants to dry clean a tank top? not me, sadly. too bad. style was cute and color was awesome.",0
This dress is so beautiful in person! but the quality was very upsetting. i had two buttons come off before even putting it on. i was so excited to get his dress for my wedding shower and then i couldn't wear it :(,0
"I wanted this dress so bad for a trip to hawaii. i sized up when i saw the side zip because i'm a little larger in the top than bottom, but whoa... even when sizing up, i think i would have needed to size up like 3x to get this to work. the dress is adorable, and if you have a smaller bust, it will work for you... so sad it wouldn't work for me.",0
"Embroidered tulips look like they were plucked when comparing the dresses in the product photos. took a chance any way, came out disappointed because i couldn't zip up the bodice. i hate side zips and when you pair a cheap zipper with delicate material, recipe for disaster! i am top and back heavy so though i lost weight and went down a cup size, my back is too wide for the 12p. for reference i'm 135# 36d 38/28/35.",0
"Love it- super cute. can wear it to work with blazer or out at night. i'm 5'3"" and got a size small, a little shorter in the front but that seems to be style, fits great",1
"Wanted to love this top, and could imagine lots of outfits with it. the wide shoulders made my arms/shoulders look big. the ruching and extra flap landed at an odd place, accentuating my belly. it did arrive very wrinkled, although a previous reviewer said she found it to be a wrinkle free garment. maybe that made the look worse. overall i felt that it made me look 15 lbs heavier than i am, so back it goes. i am 5'7"", 160lbs, 34dddd, and the size large was the correct size.",0
"I bought this top and it ran huge, i had to get an extra small. well then i wash it according to the instructions and it shrunk horribly! like its so small now my 3 yr old could probably wear it! i'm so sad, i really liked this top....but for it to shrink after one wear is not acceptable.",0
I had hopes for this shirt but was disappointed in the fabric...it's very stiff and heavy for a summer blouse. will be returning it.,0
"I love a good peplum top, and was so excited when it arrived, but was sad to find the flare on the peplum was a little too much. i'm not sure why it was so unflattering, because in every other way, it fit like a dream, but it seemed like either there was too much or too little fabric around the waist to have it hang properly. it had to go back.",0
"This tee is amazing! it is so soft and comfortable. and is great for those of us who are tall, it has great length! i went with a medium because i didn't want it too tight. i really hope that retailer restocks soon because i want to buy one in every color!",1
Super comfortable!! i am 34 weeks pregnant and i works great for me now and i think it will be perfect post baby also!,1
"Loved this shirt so much that i bought in 3 colors. love the luxurious feel of the silky, flowing fabric that flatters in all the best ways. however, after washing per instructions, the fabric lost its good qualities and turned into a blah, pilled mess that gathers at the seams (especially the bottom seam). tried dry cleaning another shirt and it came out the same way as washing. looks like a cheap, lackluster layering top now and definitely won't last another season. so disappointed - if you ca",0
It breaks my heart to say this but i had to return for shape issues. i am not a fan of dolman sleeves (they make me look big and bulky) and i wished i would have known that prior to purchasing. it is unfortunate because it is a really beautiful knit and quality. i could see this working better on someone tall and thin.,0
"At 5'5"" (almost), 122lbs., i always wear a size small. however this dress runs large (no, i am not smaller than i was 6 months ago) and it looked like a dumpy sack on me. too bad, i really wanted it to fit! it is a slightly heavier fabric than anticipated, and would be an excellent travel dress. i may try the xs. . .",0
"Purchased in the light grey and was so excited, i wore it the very next day. the back detailing and pocket make it more unique than a regular tee and the fabric is slightly heavy (in a good way) so it hangs beautifully. easily can be dressed up or down. new favorite tee!",1
"I ordered this and hoped it would be a fun & whimsical sweater for this winter. instead, it's just strange. it didn't fit well. too short in the overall length & in the sleeves. the shades of the yarn were drab. it also didn't seem made to last. it looked like it would pill/snag in a short amount of time. i returned it. i'd love to see a style similar to this executed better in the future. having a unique sleeve is a cute idea.",0
I love simplicity in clothing and this tee fits the bill! i put it on and instantly feel basic elegance.,1

"I almost never take the time to write reviews but this shirt is amazing... it's a super soft, stretchy, substantial fabric that is incredibly flattering. it falls perfectly and is insanely comfortable. i am 5'5"" 120 lbs and usually wear an xs or s in retailer tops... i went with the xs and it is a perfect fit. love it so much i bought it in 4 colors... i am now completely broke but these shirts will be in constant rotation.",1
"I love joggers, best style to come along in awhile. i think these are well made and i like the fabric. i just wish the leg were cut a bit slimmer but that's just a matter of preference. i definitely like them and will keep and wear.",1
"Beautiful colors. lightweight flannel, so a great pair of sleep pants that can be worn year round. i ordered a s, my typical size, which turned out to be quite large on me. hopefully the xs will fit better.",1
"Although i wish this was not so dark blue for summer, it is the most fabulous cut, super sexy with the tie neckline and love the side pockets... and did i mention the fabric is ridiculously soft? i just wish it was more of a blue denim blue but nonetheless, i could not walk away from the store without this. i am 5'9, 142 lbs and medium fit me perfect for length in the leg.",1
"This is soooo much more cropped than it looks in the picture. the fabric is super soft and design is cute. i really wanted to like this, but it just doesn't fit as shown. the back is halfway up by back and i am shortwaisted...",0
"I purchased this item in the gray heather color and loved it so much i wanted to buy every other color. the fabric was cottony and felt very soft and cushy against my skin, and the gray color was from the combination of black and white fibers. i ordered the light gray and the red online and could not wait for them to arrive. but the other colors were not even in the same material, but a very shiny and synthetic feeling fabric, with just a single color weave that did not have the same feel or tex",0
"I love this top, it's long enough to to wear with leggings and the ribbon in the back really dresses it up. the only negative is that the material pulls easy and only on the space dye color, not the solids but i still love it! for reference i ordered xs and it fits perfectly i am 5'2 125lbs",1
"This dress will unfortunately be returned...so cute online and looks like a sack in person.  runs very large, arm holes are very low.  not flattering.",0
"This shirt is amazing! it's an excellent heavier weight quality t-shirt, but so comfortable. if you are looking for the perfect shirt to pair with your leggings and boots this fall/winter/spring, this is it! i am 5'8"" 136 lbs and this perfectly covers my rump and the small fit perfectly. the band around the wrist is a nice touch, making this a higher quality tee. i am buying more colors.",1
A $200 piece of polyester with no shape and looks good only on the model. avoid ! mine went back the same day it came in the mail...,0
"Exactly what i was looking for. cozy, not too warm, fits comfortably and roomy without looking baggy. the print is beautiful. will definitely be buying more sleepwear from retailer!",1
Extremely comfortable t. fits tts. bought in black & teal. can be dressed up with a scarf or worn with just jewelry. fairly lightweight so probably not a good choice for cold winter months. great price too!,1
"I wanted to love it - the color is great, the embroidery pretty, but the stiff scalloped sleeves were just too much. if you have broad shoulders this is not the shirt for you. i think personally it would have been better had the material been softer.",0
"These are long, easily wear with skinny jeans, they do not cling and are not see through! the colors are great!",1
"Love this t-shirt! i live in miami and have a 5 month old so i practically live in shorts and t-shirts, and this shirt fits beautifully and adds a little extra pop to your everyday t. love the material too!",1
So super soft and comfortable - great to throw on to run errands with ease while still looking stylish - the lace up front makes it more special that just a standard tee shirt dress,1
I love this tee. really comfortable and super cute too!,1
"Beautiful detail, soft drapey fabric. but it pulls funny from where they added stitching at the top of the v. for me it was also a little short but i have a long torso. i'm 5'7"" 155lbs and the size medium fit nicely with the exception of the length.",0
"I really love this dress but am deciding whether to keep it because, while it fits well in the skirt and around my torso, it is tight in the arms. i can't really lift my arms above should height. the plus is that it would keep me from bidding too much at my kid's school auction. the negative is that it would be hard to dance in.",1
"Was really looking forward to this sweater, but it's not a cardigan, it's a poncho. i can't decide if it's fun-quirky or just odd. it's gorgeously made, and extremely soft, but i do wish it was actually sleeves. i haven't decided if it's something i will wear or not. my husband referred to it as ""batwings."" that should have been depicted in one of the photos.",0
"Cute top, a little less fitted than i was expecting.",1
"This dress is very clever. fabric is on thicker side so it eliminates any worries about dimples or imperfections. the tie at neck line is effortlessly sexy and not at all trashy as another reviewer felt. you could tie it if you didn't want any cleave, or leave it looser for more casual look. i got the small bc i felt comfortable with a little cling given how forgiving the fabric was. it still showed shape when i walked. i was surprised to like it as much as i did. husband insisted i get it becau",1
"I was excited to receive this top. it looked great online, vibrant colors with the beautiful detail on the sleeves. when i tried it on, the fabric looked and felt cheap. it is not a flowy top. do not recommend it.",0
"This dress is one of the most beautiful dresses i have seen. purchased for my daughter . . . it was as if you made this dress for her. had to return it because the woven fabric was fraying around the back v neckline and zipper. was able to replace it, the replacement looks good -- have a concern about two areas but we will see. just love the lines and fit of this dress! truly hope the fabric holds up.",1
"I bought this top on sale - very glad i did not pay full price for it! i wash everything before i wear it. when it dried i saw that there was a grease spot on the back and a small hole on one upper arm - i will probably be able to take care of the grease spot, but the hole will be a little trickier, as the material is kind of filmy.",0
"I splurged on this pajama set for myself and now regret it. even though the design is adorable, the fabric contains acrylic and the knitted fairisle part started pilling within the first week of wear. after a month and a couple washes, it looks horrible, and the fleece part is looking a little grungy as well. so so disappointed. the top is intentionally oversized and comes down to my crotch, i could have easily sized down.",0
"Love this top!!
great colors and fits great
reasonably priced",1
Hangs terribly off the chest. tent-like. looks maternity. no thanks.,0
"I ordered this top because it was 100 percent cotton and a cute design. when it arrived, i thought it was a cute, different top, uniquely designed. when i tried it on, it looked like a had several extra rolls due to the ruching and was very unflattering. it reminded me of the michelin man wearing extra tires and i am of a thin build so i did not like the perception of rolls throughout the bodice. unfortunately, it did not work for me. i wish retailer would include more cotton tops in their collect",0
"I am returning this dress as it looks pretty matronly once it's on. the top was also very tight in the arms and chest (i am 5'9"", 140lbs, and 34d).",0
"Love this sweater. bought this with the matching leggings. couldn't be more comfortable. cozy fabric. cute details. loving them both. please bring more of the same in different colors, patterns.",1
"So cozy and warm, great for the cold nights!",1
"I ordered this shirt online and just received it in the mail. the floral design is nice, but the mesh fabric in the back is low quality and cheapens the look of the shirt (especially considering the price). most disappointingly, the neck hole is almost as small as the arm holes. with no zipper or button opening i could not fit my head through the opening and, thus, could not even put the shirt on. needless to say, i will be returning it. i ordered the xs, so it is possible that larger sizes do n",0
I love the versatility of this top. i feel like i can wear it with anything to dress it up or down.,1
"I bought this dress to wear to a wedding and it is a stunner! really one of the most gorgeous dresses i've ever owned. it is very very fancy and really i'd say most appropriate for a black tie event, an evening wedding or a mother of the bride or groom. superb quality... just amazing! i have a few bryon lars dresses and this one seems to run about true to size. the others i own seem to run a little large.",1
"Was not flattering on my body - i have a fuller figure, and this just made me look like i was pregnant.",0
"I got some nice things for christmas but this (along with the matching leggings) was hands down my absolute favorite gift! so stylish, so cozy, the perfect length to cover your bottom, the perfect fit (38dd and ordered an xl), love the pockets, i could go on and on. the perfect set to lounge around the house in. sleeves are a bit long so i had to fold them. when i say it is ""the perfect fit"" it is oversized (not huge) but it is roomy and that's how i like it as loungewear.",1
"Looks great with skinny jeans, leggings, trouser/ wide leg. good length for a flattering look. longer in front on me than on model.... so soft. doesn't cling. not overwhelming because the sleeves are skinny and drape is narrow.",1
"I am 5'8"", about 140, athletic build. i purchased this dress for business meetings and such. i was worried the dress was going to be too low cut but i  am small chested so i can wear lower cuts without exploding out of it. luckily this is the case here too! the dress has a professionally sexy look which i love. nice fabric, good quality. happy i bought it!",1
"I really wanted this shirt to work -- the fabric is really cool -- but sadly the cut was just way off. i'm 5'10"", and the shirt was much shorter on me than on the model, and the cut was just too wide under the armpits.",0
"This dress is very pretty in person. it fits true to size and is very figure flattering. one other reviewer mentioned it is a bit low cut, but i think that can be resolved by wearing a cami underneath to cover cleavage. my only gripe with this dress is that it's a little rough and stiff feeling. i am really sensitive to that and only buy things that are velvety soft. it probably works for most people but not for me, so had to go back.",0
"Dress caught my eye on the rack so i thought i'd try it on. the dress has lovely blue stripes (hard to discern in the online photo) which makes it a great year-round piece. however, like others have commented, it is too low to wear to work. will consider alternations to close the v-neck if the dress is marked down beyond its current sale price.",0
This is a great sweater/poncho. is a little short so i wear a t shirt underneath. great color and looks good with black pants or skinny jeans.,1
I love this dress! it fits me so well and is extremely comfortable. i can't wait until it gets a little warmer so i can wear it with a trench and cute flats or heeled sandals.,1
"I am 34dd. bought sz med and have plenty of room up top. the black motif is really a dark, purple/blue. slightly sheer. the length on the med is 251/4 from bottom of collar (the collar adds 1 1/4"") the length does not cover my bum like the model , covers 2/3rds, nor does it appear as long in front.",1
"Surprisingly versatile and figure flattering without being too clingy and revealing like so many ""bandage"" dresses. the navy color softens the stripes. great piece for travel as it is light and does not wrinkle. i am 5'7"" and 125 lbs. with a smaller chest and curvy hips. the small fits perfectly.",1
"First, i absolutely love cloth & stone. but lately i'm finding some of the styles are going in a direction that just doesn't fit my style. that's ok because they still have some good basics. 


what i mean is the cut. a lot of their pieces are super long in the back and super short in the front (ie their slip dress they have out right now). this particular tank is like that, although this one is borderline. the sides cut up a little too high for my tastes and i can't help but think i'm wearin",0
"The top fits nice, but after one wear (didn't even washed it) the fabric was all fuzzy. would not recommend it.",0
Beautiful fit and true to size. highly recommend. they are long and you will need to have them hemmed but they are soft and feel amazing on.,1
"Okay, i love the blouse this brand has in the same material, so i thought i'd delight in this dress. i am a 5'7"" hourglass but have a longer torso. i ordered the large in this, usually a 10 or 12 fits me.. but the waist hit much higher than my natural waist, and yet it was somewhat tight and completely rigid. the bust area was a little loose, and i'm a 36c. then the bottom flared out in sort of a flower fairy poof above my knees which reminded me of a navy blue oompa loompa dress.. and i love my",0
"Love this skirt, beautiful fabric and lined. looks great with a tailored jean jacket by pilcro or the window pain patterned retailer cartonnier jacket. i chose the size 8 though a little snug in the waist it fit better than the size 10. i am 150 lbs and 5'4 inches and curvy with small waist but curvy hips with a tush so this cut is perfect for my shape. i love the asymmetrical design with how the skirt will partial zip and the fabric attachment underneath with hidden button. love the edgy look. so",1
I am usually drawn to more color but the vertical and horizontal lines of this dress made me curious. the fit is absolutely incredible! i like the fact that it is very easy to put on without any zippers or buttons as well. it hugs your body in all the right places. i had no issue with the dress riding up and the way the designer placed the lines makes this one even more flattering. gorgeous dress!!,1
"This dress seems quite high quality and is wonderfully designed, except in the chest. the wrap style hugs in all the right places but the chest. i'm slightly large chested (34c/d) but can usually wear a size small or size 4 in dresses and tops (5'5"", 122 lbs). the small in this dress was great everywhere else, but i couldn't breathe and it totally flattened out my chest. also, it is quite low cut, so another mark against it for anyone with a semi-large bust. couldn't wear it to work that reason",0
"I love this top!!!! the design, quality, and look are all insanely gorgeous. i got this top during the 20% off tops promo, which helped so much with the cost, and i was trying to use up a store credit i had on something of high quality. (after going through a whirlwind of exchanges that resulted in much disappointment.) i couldn't be more thrilled with this choice! it is so flattering on, beautiful color and cut. the only complaint i have is slightly minor, and it's in relation to the hidden bac",1
"I agree with the other reviewer who said there was too much hardware and such. this really does have a lot going on. i usually wear a 4 in skirts, and based on reviews, went up one size. it still saw way up near my chest - i think even an 8 would be too small! it's sooooo tiny at the waist. probably buy 2 sizes, 2 and 3 sizes up from your own. also, the skirt flares super wide at the sides, it doesn't sit the way in the photo or maybe the model is holding it down with her hand. it's like a skirt",0
If you have an hourglass figure this dress accentuates your curves. i do need to wear a tank underneath as dress is low cut.,1
"I liked the understated colors of this dress, so i decided to try it on. i did not expect it to fit so well! i'm 5'3"" with a large bust and large hips. the dress was super slimming and flattering, it skimmed my figure as if it was made for me. the only thing i'd have to fix is the shoulder straps being just a smidge too long, but i'm used to that with my height. the straps are positioned perfectly, my bra straps didn't even show. the material is very thin and light.",1
"First off, i love the dress! i love anything that you can throw on for a monday and be ready in 20 minutes. the material is good but the compartments for the bust do not hold a d+cup. i ordered the 6 and it fit perfectly except in the bust. easy fix, a white cami, the sale price makes that necessity acceptable. it's a keeper.",1
"Color is beautiful but looks like a maternity top on. i found i could tuck it in slacks and it looked fine. now for the cons:  it is supposed to be peacock design but i had only one peacock,under my arm, which could be seen, i guess, if i waved. the rest were parts of the bird. i would love to have the one in the photos!  next, who thought cheap white buttons on the back was a good idea?  if i had gotten a nice patterned top, i would have replaced the buttons. blouses that i like never seem to b",0
"Love this vest- it's so chic and pairs with so much.  i have it in the army green and it's prefect to wear over a romper or white jeans and top.   it's great.   i am about 5'2"" and an typically a small top-  the small was much to big but the xs was perfect. i would consider trying to size down if you are uncertain. i am very happy with my purchase!",1
Perfect summer pants until i wanted to pet my dog and they ripped first time wearing them.,0
These pants fit great!! i ordered my normal medium and they fit perfectly. i was worried that they may look too much like pajamas and lot look right with my stomach but no issues there. i think i will get a lot of use out of these!,1
"I am 5'2"" and 115lbs......ordered the blue motif in small petite. they were not only too big overall but were way too long. i had to roll them up several times to get the right length. because of fabric design these would definitely have to be hemmed. i had to check tag because i thought for sure i got sent a regular length but they were petite. not sure if they are worth trying in a smaller size..... pants were really comfy but maybe too pajama like for my taste.",0
"But the back of it, by the waist, bunches just a tiny bit. if i get bigger, it will be too long. but i love the skirt, it is flattering and cute. not itchy for me even if the title says wool. i ordered the 00p and the length is pretty much as pictured, just below the knee in front. the waist is snug, bigger it would fall more on my hips (hence the too long comment earlier. (115 lbs, 26-27 in waist, short legs...)",1
"I saw a stylist wearing a similar piece from a few seasons ago and commented that i liked it on her. i was told they had a different version (a few actually) and i decided to try it on. it actually is pretty flattering, i had flared jeans on but also could see it with a dress. i left it open, as pictured, tied one button, and also played with the neck and tried a cowl... all very nice.

i debated getting my usual xs petite, but hey, they don't make it in petite, and the stylist thought the loo",1
These are a great casual workday pant. the loose fit and light weight material makes it a great summer option.,1
"I went out on a limb ordering this romper. it's not really in my ""wheelhouse"" the whole romper thing. but it was a home run! i was afraid it might look too young and that i couldn't ""pull it off,"" but the long sleeves and overall style was perfect. and my twenty something nieces were obsessed with it as well. as far as fit, i'm 5'7"" 134lbs and ordered a size 4. i have a long torso and was concerned because some people said it ran short there, but i didn't have any trouble with that. i just took",1
"The colors in the green shirt are beautiful, however the cut looked like a maternity top on me. i'm 5'6"" 120#, not very busty. must try it on to match the right body type; i'm thinking very tall, wispy , less curves...",0
Another success! so comfortable and stylish for spring and summer. very lightweight yet not sheer. design is even more appealing in person. a must have for your closet.,1
"The blouse is lovely - i loved the lace, color (though just as other reviewers mentioned its a darker blue closer to a teal color) and edging. i am very petite, for reference, 5'2"", 24 waist and 30e and normally wear a 00 or 00p. the 00 was still too wide for me around the waist/bottom and had too much of a swingy effect - it made me look like i was pregnant so i sadly returned. i wish this had more of a fitted look to it.",0
"Purchased these in both colors today. (great sale price.)
hei hei is my favorite brand of pants, especially their pull on prints.
i am always a medium, these ran slightly large in the waist and stomach. i tried on a few mediums and luckily found the smallest in each.
the beige motif is beautiful and can really be dressed up. the material is soft the color scheme is gorgeous. they have a lovely silky feel to them. i always wear an over top so the little bit largeness won't bother me. being on",1
"Bought these today at the denver store (nice peeps at cc!). anyway, i feel in love. the style is simple, free and easy for summer and the neutral color is lovely in person. so glad i bought these...now i have something to wear to work tomorrow :)!",1
"Wore this romper 1x and after washing, the hem on one of the shorts/legs completely unraveled. if i want to ever wear it again, i will have to bring it to a tailor to get fixed. unacceptable for a $200 product. cute design and good fit but questionable quality.",0
"The fabric is too sheer, also looks like sleepwear. just not my thing.",0
"This dress is really fun and easy to wear all winter. the colors are really easy to pair and like the last reviewer mentioned, i love the sheer sleeves. i was very worried about the comfort of the fabric because most sweater dresses always fail. this dress is extremely comfortable to wear. it is not scratchy at all. it is soft and comfortable for winter even indoors with the building's heat blasting away. the dress will fit the size you normally wear, however it may show lumps and bumps. i would",1
"When this piece arrived, i was surprised at how weightless it was. there are 2 layers to it, an underlayer and then a very fine silk toplayer together, the ensemble is incredibly light and it is almost as though i feel like i am not wearing anything at all. to take it home, i did have to kind of stuff it in my bag, and this caused some considerable wrinkles which are very difficult to get out (super stubborn( but i am pleased with the look of the garment. usually, i like the look of a dress that",1
"This dress arrived today in such a crumpled and wrinkled state that i was reluctant to even try it on. it is on the large size, but fine if you are looking for a very flowing look. longer at the front than shown in the photograph and i am 5'9"". i am sending it back. it is a pretty fabric, although shinier than expected. i am just not prepared to spend so much time pressing and steam ironing this item every time i want to wear it.",0
"The fabric clung to my body i expected it to flow and be breezy, it was too flimsy, the arms were too wide and overall for $100 this dress didn't cut the mustard. i'm 5'7"" 135 the dress was long enough, just didn't flow very well.",0
"This is such a soft, comfortable and well fitting blazer. i love the structured cut of a material that is usually used in more casual designs. i look forward to wearing it very often in the fall. so glad i purchased this one!",1
"First of all, this skirt is as cute on as it is in the picture. very flattering. i am a curvy gal on the bottom and this is flattering. that being said, it runs small. i purchased a large which is my usual size, and i need another inch or two all over to make it work. part of the problem is the material. it is a very heavy, durable upholstery like material. there is absolutely no give to this. it is a very stiff material as well -- more what i would expect on a sofa than on my skirt. the skirt c",0

"I wore this dress for christmas and agree that it is beautiful (i received many compliments), while i agree that this sweater dress is beautiful, i'm a little worried about the quality. after just a day of wearing it, it seemed to have lost it's shape. the bottom hem of the dress looked stretched out and it sagged slightly all over. i'm 5'7"", 135lbs and my typical size is a m/4 and the dress fit perfectly initially, but not so much by christmas dinner. i'm not giving up on it because i was still",1

This one pulled across my shoulders and neck in a creepy way. did not like the way that it fit. returned,0

pros:
- it does have a nice flow as others stated.
- pockets are a surprise touch for a silk dress.
- the slip inside is detachable.

cons:

Beautiful jacket and i got lots of compliments. true to size. it's not thick but it's very warm.,1
I really liked this tank. i purchased it in the green. i went with my regular size 2. yes it's boxy but it's a nice tank that will get lots of use this summer. i'm planning on using it on our vacation to the beach . it is thin and soft.,1
"I bought this dress in red for a wedding. i love the laser-cut design and the fit overall is good except, as another reviewer wrote, the psuedo-empire waste is likely not awesome for anyone with an average to longer torso. i have a super long torso and the dress still works, but a lower waist would have taken it from good to ""wow"". love the innovative take on a classic silhouette/design, though (and the red is gorgeous).",1

"This dress is definitely light weight and it requires a slip or you could wear a black tank and tights with boots. there wasn't a security tag in mine so no holes when i bought in store. i even accidentally caught it on a costume bracelet and it did not rip or damage. although, you probably wouldn't want to sit on concrete or rub against something rough. i would recommend this dress- its gorgeous on. for the price, i think it should come with a slip. fyi, the back half of the waist has elastic,",1

"I wanted to wait until i could give this dress a thorough wearing before i reviewed it.  it exceeded my expectations!  i wore it at an outdoor wedding (the red) and received so many compliments on it.  it is well-constructed and the cutouts are gorgeous.  no danger so far of them ripping or tearing.  the zipper in the back is a little bulky for the dress, but not a major deterrent.

"I love this dress. i'd get it in both colors if i could! the cut and fit is beautiful, i'd suggest sizing down if you feel like it's too boxy or lacks shape. the bottom skirt is round enough to where you can twirl ( #1 thing to look for in a dress ;) ) and it's just overall a classic pretty dress. my only complaint is that the overlay cut out seems a little bit delicate and i'm afraid it will be ruined after a few wears but it seems to be holding up fine so far and isn't incredibly delicate like",1
"Thought i would splurge on a tracy reese coat. i got a size small, (120, 5'6) felt huge on me and i looked like a wooly mammoth. very unflattering. another reviewer also mentioned on how it flairs slightly at the bottom?.adding to the overall bad look. i had it on for about 20 seconds and put it back in the bag to return. din't have to ponder about it at all.",0
"On the hanger, this dress looks a bit boxy, however once on, it has a beautiful flow and elegance to it. it's super feminine and cinches in at the waist perfectly. my one (major) complaint that prevented me from purchasing the dress? there's no give to the dress. i wasn't able to lift my arms up past 90 degrees and that's sort of a problem. it's a shame though because the outside shell is gorgeous and so structured, and it would have been a nice contrast to the shape of the dress on a body.",1
"Ordered this in xs my normal size (5'5"" 110 lbs) and it was huge! did not particularly care for the style either nothing special.",0

Very pretty & shimmery. suitable for slightly dressier occasions. comfortable fit.,1
"I bought this in the blue stripe and the color is not what is shown at all! the photo shows a bright, vibrant blue and white stripe top. i got a white and very light pastel blue stripe top. so disappointed because the top doesn't have that wow look as shown in the photo. however, it goes well with blue jeans even in the lighter shade of blue.

and, the fabric is nice and cool for hot summer days. the fit is tts. i bought a 16 and if you wear an 18 this will fit also. i didn't find this too box",1
"The blouse is beautiful. the quality and design are spot on. but it runs quite large. i normally wear a small or an extra small depending on the cut. i ordered this in a small based on the way it seemed to fit the model. it's huge. i'm going to have to reorder in a smaller size, but i'm not sure if the xs or xxs will fit better. i'll probably drive to my retailer store and try it on in person. for comparison, i am 116 pounds, 36-26-36.,",1

It hangs very nicely on the model in the picture but when i put it on it fit tight in the sleeves and upper back but huge in the front. the sweater was also sparkly which made it look cheap. i loved the lace detail in the back but the sweater was returned. did not fit well and was not good quality. very thin,0

This could have been an amazing chemise but it is too short even for bed- perhaps it could be used for a tank. i am 5'3 but do have a long torso. it did not fully cover my booty.,0
I tried this on in my regular size and a size up. just didn't work in either. the attached slip bunched underneath and the material was rough. i did not purchase it.,0
"I have a narrow face, and most coats with the big collars overwhelm me. this proportion is perfect. follows my shape without constricting but flows so well for a good line. color isn't quite laden green; it's more teal which works even better for me. so hard to find a wool coat these days that isn't bulky.",1
"I bought this dress to wear to an out of state wedding. first time wearing, when i tied the strap, the pull through at the top of the halter broke with minimal stress. i sewed it back with a repair kit from the hotel but was worried the whole night the dress would not hold up. if this is all that is holding the dress on, it should be more secure with reinforced stitching. beautiful material and comfortable.",0
"This is a great coat, very lightweight, but warm. the color is gorgeous. it is fitted at the waist with fullness below and a great length. i am writing this review to give a heads up about the sizing. by usual retailer sizing this runs small and short waisted. i am generally an retailer x small and i need to exchange this one for a small or maybe even a medium (if i want to wear much underneath it). as it is it fits too well, like a dress, not a coat and looks short waisted. in fact, when i tr",1

"I wanted to love this. couldn't wait for it to arrive.  unfortunately, it doesn't look anything like the picture.  i usually wear a m/l in holding horses so i ordered a l but as soon as i held it up i noticed it was ridiculously large. the fabric is on the heavy side so the dress just hangs in a very unflattering way. and, it is extremely shimmery.  i love velvet, but the texture and sheen of this dress was just over the top. sadly, it is going back.",0
"I bought the ""light grey"" color. the dress in the photo does not look a thing like the dress in person, it does not look grey at all but more of a light teal/light blue.  it is absolutely gorgeous and has a slight swing shape. i took my normal size xs.  the end of the sleeves (where the buttons are) are very tight but still fit, you just have to be careful taking off or else undo the buttons.  also online inventory says no one has this in store, but i did end up finding it (rockefeller).",1

"I loved this coat in the picture, and couldn't wait to get it. sadly, it did not deliver in real life. i got my usual size small, and it fit well in the shoulders and sleeves, and okay in front. the big problem was the back. it just hung from my shoulders with zero shape, and a lot of extra fabric. i considered trying the xs, but was concerned that the shoulders might not be comfortable, and honestly i can't believe the xs could possibly have been different enough to work. maybe i got a defectiv",0
Very comfortable to wear. you can wear it any season.  it runs true to size.  nice fabric.  it&amp;#39;s a simple black dress.  love it!,1
I ordered a size 0. the dress was extremely large. i am 5'2 and weigh 110. i guess you really must be 5'9 like the model to wear this dress. such a shame..,0
"I wanted a comfortable and loose casual dress. i liked the pictures and decided to give it a try.
the dress turned out to be too loose (i got size 4 after checking the measurements chart, i'm 5'7' 125 lb and usually wear s). i could practically wrap myself in this dress. besides, it looks a bit too long (well, i'm not as tall as the model in the photos and i don't like wearing high heels).
the material looks faded, not as bright as in the pictures. i like distressed and vintage style, but this",0
"This is quite an odd dress. it does wrap and is beautiful material. however, the dress does not close at all in the chest area. i thought perhaps it was meant to be a kimono. it will go back for sure.",0

"First, i was surprised that this skirt fabric felt similar to men's tie.  it is a thick weight silky feel.  next, i was surprised by the cut.... i wear a 12/14 petite, and the waist of the large is at least a size 10 if not smaller.  finally, the length was really long.  i realize i am 5'2 and buying non-petite sizes, but the cut was high ankle on me. i like the pattern and ruffles of fabric, both are unusual and good for fall/winter.  but i did not like the rest.",0
"I ordered this online with out trying it on the store. it does hang a teeny bit loser than in the photo of the model but in my opinion doesn't look bad. plus, i'm not a model...;) what i did was put a thick belt on and it just brought the dress to a new level. love it with a belt. i am an art teacher and it was perfect for work and then going out after with friends.

I got this sweater in navy and it is much cuter than online! it is a great transition sweater and also i can see it used on cool nights at the beach. i have worn in professional environment to work as well as with a tee and jeans. i love it!,1

Love the dolman sleeves and its the perfect length. throw on a cute necklace and go.,1
"This skirt is gorgeous, sturdy, well constructed. i was afraid the midi length would look frumpy, but it was beautiful. it has a nice lining, flares into a pretty a line, and has a pull tab belt around the waist to cinch it a bit. i am normally a 2-4, and i bought the 4. it was a bit big, but the belt helped with that. i wore it for my bridal shower and got many compliments!",1
"This was my first time to purchase and wear a tunic and i was very hesitant about the look, but i love this design! it is beautiful and seems to be very well made. i agree with a previous reviewer that the slit is high (it comes to my waist, but i don't think it is a problem. i always appreciate this in other reviews, so hopefully it helps: i'm 5'2"", 117 lbs, and a small 32b. the xs works well for me.",1

I am addicted to retailer and have purchased many many items from them. this is definitely one of the best blouses i ever purchased by far. i saw this while browsing through the store and love the print and colors and detailing. i espeically loved the velvet cutouts that gave this already beautiful sweater something extra. i did not purchase this top then because i felt full price was too much and on the hanger it looked like it could be short and boxy. when retailer had their black friday sa,1

"I just purchased this velvet top in my regular size small (34-27-35) so i'd say it runs tts and i couldn't be happier! the designer, moulinette soeurs is one of my very favorites here at retailer and always seems to come through for me when i need something really special. it's is a vintage style top that reminds me of something miss fisher from ""miss fisher's murder mysteries,"" the ""downton abbey"" ladies or the designer sisters from ""the house of eliott"" would wear and that's a major compliment.",1
"While this top has a lovely design, neckline and color the metalic threads made it too shimmery for me. i actually think it looks better in pictures than in person because of the metallic threads.",0

first the good: the design. it is classy. it will keep boobies (the ones of the larger side) in place. this is amazing as there isnt really a way to wear a bra with with dress. it is slimming and i have hips. 

the bad: surprisingly, the fabric gets dirty super easy. i have no idea why everything clings to it. i got my dress f",1
Matronly and unflattering. i think this may work on a very tall and slender body type.,0
"The design/pattern balances broader shoulders/narrower hips and gives my straighter waist definition.

at 5'1"", size 2 ended mid-knee, but overall felt a little too long (torso length). i normally take 0p or 00p in retailer dresses.

i like the feel of the fabric and the overall playful yet chic look.",1

"I ordered this in my usual size small (36b bust, 5'5"", around 116 lbs), but the seam around the high waist stuck out and didn't cinch in at the waist at all, rather bubbled out a bit. the tunic ""flaps"" laid strangely as well, like they were too small almost. the high cut sides were indeed high cut...showing the waistband of my leggings. apparently that is a new style, as i have seen a few other tops like it around, but i question whether slits that high are appropriate for actual wear outside on",0
"The quality of the fabric is soft and thick and well made. loved everything about it but if you are ample in the chest, it is snug and does not hang and drape as well like on the model, so you may want to size up. i am sending it back as the fit is not flattering on me for the price. someone with a boyish no-curve figure would look dynamite in it!",1
I wanted to love this tunic sweater. the material is so soft and a perfect weight. the color is pretty. bu the fit absolutely did not work for me. the tunic runs very small. a large usually fits me but i felt like i was wearing a small. the slits are quite high. i was sorry to do it but this one went straight back!,0
"Great item. ordered for my wife for christmas. received it and the medium petite waist size measured at approximately 26"" (so it is at least 2"" off the standard--and a thick material needs a bit more room to fit well). disappointed! replaced with next size up...we'll see!",0
"This dress had so much potential. the top was absolutely gorgeous. my issue was with the bottom half of the dress. the bottom is made from a heavy quilted material that is stiff and has no movement at all. the dress is supposed to fit like a modified mermaid dress where its more fitted around the hips and flares out, the dress i received had so much material on the bottom that it actually made my hips look bigger. i though about having the dress altered but decided to return instead.",0
"I got this for a special event and while i had to special order due to it not being in my local store yet, the minute i tried it on was very happy with the fit, feel and overall look. at the event i got so many compliments and love the way it fits - attractive, sturdy and very comfortable to wear, even with kicking up my heels on the dance floor. am so happy i got this and plan to wear it to other events coming up (weddings, parties, etc.)",1

"I should have heeded the previous reviewer's advice. but i'm really short so i thought i'd give it a try. there is something really wrong with the bust. first, it's about 3-4 inches higher than it should be. the bottom trim cut across the middle of my bust. even if i hoisted everthing up in there to fit the cups, they are really only designed to fit cones, not curves. from the side it looked hideous. too bad, because the fabric and fit everywhere else is gorgeous.",0

"I absolutely adore this dress! the beautiful details and shape make it so much more unique and special than your typical linen dress. it's effortless, yet still a showstopper. i am a size 4 with hourglass shape and my normal size 4 it fits me like it was made for me. it's not too tight in the ribcage, yet it is slimming and flattering. not matronly at all! the laces can be worn tied up for a more modest look, or worn untied for a breezy, casual, a bit more sexy look. i will be wearing this dress",1
"Yes! yes! yes! 
i buy a lot of dresses from retailer, and about once a year i hit the jackpot with a dress that hits all the marks! this dress is it!

i bought the white linen version on a whim. i never buy white dress because, 1. i don't want to look bigger than my pear shape already is, and 2. i like red wine and i that's risky in a white dress!

I agree with the other reviewer that the color of this top is more burgundy with purple undertones rather than a deep red like shown online. the fit was very boxy on me and it did not look flattering. i was not willing to to have it altered so i returned it.,0
"I really wanted to like this top, but couldn't seem to find the right fit. i tried it on in 3 different sizes and none of them were right - they were either too wide in the hips, or a little narrow in the shoulder. it is cute overall though - and a good way to do a short top, without feeling like you're in a ""crop top""",0

so i played around with it and ended up putting in 2 small darts in the front. and v",1
This would be perfect except for the ridiculous attached scarf. the material is so soft and luxe. the colors are richer in person and perfectly go with everything. but the attached scarf ruins everything!! the scarf is not flattering and takes away form the cute buttons on the front. if the scarf could be removed it would be a great sweater coat. so disappointing.,0
"I tried these shorts on in 5 colors and found a wide variety of sizing. in the dark grey and taupe i needed to size down one from my usual 28 to a size 27. in the sapphire, lavender and red my regular size 28 fit perfectly. i ended up purchasing the dark grey and lavender with a discount. i gave 4 stars for the variation in sizing but once i got the correct fit the shorts have not stretched out on me throughout the day in either color. the length is perfect, short enough to not look frumpy, but",1
"I'm pretty disappointed in these. just bought the yellow pair and wore today for the first time. super cute and very comfortable. i was in love with them. they got two small stains on them from the day's activities ( and not even crazy, untreatable stains). unfortunately, the stains did not budge yet the color of the shorts washed out. they are completely ruined after one washing (on cold). i'm hoping this was a fluke and plan to order a second pair before they sell out. these will be going back",0
"I love the way these shorts fit and look; very comfy, but after laundering one time, the lavender color became blotchy. used regular detergent in gentle cycle and it looks like someone poured bleach on them in random areas & they are unwearable! i have several colors, but the only color that was a problem is the lavender. $58 for one wear was a waste. i hate to leave negative feedback, but be careful with laundering.",0
"I ordered this dress to wear for summer weddings this year. i am both surprised and excited that it fits.

i normally wear an 18, sometimes a 16. stores like retailer are a place i go to admire fun cloths, but not to actually shop. i was concerned that the xl was going to be a fake xl- this happens sometimes. a brand only makes clothing up to a 12, so they're xl is really a 12. but not so! i feel like the xl could fit a 16 - 20. the l would probably fit a 16 as well.

this dress fits in",0
"Love these shorts. they do run large, i wear a 29 in pilcro and the 28 in these shorts fit comfortably with a bit of room to spare. the turquoise is definitely green, and not as bright as what i see in the online photo, but still a nice color. they have a funny smell but i'm sure that will wash out.",1
"I was extremely excited to receive these pants, given the two positive reviews. i'm a petite woman and have trouble finding jeans with the right proportions. i sized down from my normal size (27 to a 26) and was swimming in these pants. i would have had to go down three sizes to make these work. i'm not sure if i received a defective pair or what, but be cautious ordering these pants.",0
"I listened to the other reviewers and ordered down...silly of me! all plcro seem to run a bit large and do stretch out. i got the 25 in the lovely light grey...fit me, but too tight to be comfy. i usually wear a 25,26, or 27 in jeans depending on the style. unfortunately, there are now no more in the grey...too bad. this shouldn't happen at the beginning of the season....please please please bring them back in this great neutral color or a stone.....",1
"This pants the worst short that i ever had!!
i bought ;this short last week and i laundry it yesterday and it came out lost color!!
i was really shock definetly will return it to store.
fyi, i never use chrolox or bleach when i laundry.",0
"Great shorts. i've been buying these for the past few years. each year, i add to my collection with new colors. i have 8 pairs now! perfect length and can be rolled if needed to show some more leg.",1
"So glad i gave these a try last summer in the peachy pink color. this year, i got the darker grey. color is great- goes with so much-and they are so soft and comfortable. also love that these can work rolled up or down at the bottom",1
I bought these in a few different colors because they are so comfortable and perfect for summer. they fit true to size if you want a more relaxed fit. i sized down for one pair for a more fitted look.,1
"I am 5'1'' and most normal size retailer tops are too big on the armpits and neckline for me.
i don't usually go for peplum, but i was drawn to this top bc it was very soft. when i tried it on, everything fit just perfect and length was also right for me. i like slight stretch of this fabric which hugs body nicely. i would say you should get a size that fits nicely on chest area.",1
"I want to love this shirt but it isn't happening. the proportions shown on the model are not how this shirt ends up fitting. the fabric is super soft and the pattern is great, if the fit works for you.",0
This top is totally adorable. it's one of my favorite retailer tops this season. i wear it with jeans or even red skinny pants and i get tons of compliments on it. it fits true to size and the material is washable and durable.,1
"I was looking for a lightweight top to wear with black linen trousers to a party, i was not sure of this top seeing it on a slender model (i am a more typical 50 year old mom body) and i have never worn a peplum style. i put it on for my husband and approved, so i wore it. i received many compliments - a few from good friends who congratulated me for going out of my 'comfort zone' with the style!",1
"These are my all time comfiest shorts and i am obsessed with the lavender color. sadly, using free and clear detergent on a cold, delicate cycle made the color turn splotchy, and they are unwearable. this happened once and i exchanged for another pair, but i'll be returning this pair. i'll be sad to see my favorite color go, but there is obviously a defect in the dye used. maybe i'll try another color!",0
These are great wear- anywhere shorts. they are not too long and not too short. they are very soft and comfy. i ordered a size 6 and after wearing them a couple of hours i found that i should have gone with a size smaller perhaps. i will still keep the 6's for wearing around the house .,1
I absolutely love these shorts and have them in 3 colors. they are a great price point and comfortable fit. be careful with washing as the darker colors seem to bleed.,1
No. this is one of the most unflattering things i've ever put on my body. i'm a very well-proportioned hourglass - i tend to wear a small despite a booty and 36d chest - this made me look huge. don't do it.,0
"I like this top. i received a ton of compliments when i wore it to work, but the material doesn't feel as high-quality as i had expected from the pictures online. it wasn't worth it to me to send it back, but i doubt i would have bought it if i had tried it on first.",0
If i could get these in every color i would! these shorts fit so well and the quality is really nice. i wear them with t-shirts or dress them up with a blouse. i'm a mom in my mid-40's and its hard to find a decent pair of shorts that fit me without being too long or too short - these fit the bill.,1
"These have an amazing fit! i have them in three colors. they are not too low rise, they are not too high. they are the perfect length. the only thing i do not like is the rolled cuff is not stitched and comes down easily if you do not iron down.",1
Loving this top! the material is lovely and high quality plus the design is very flattering on body. perfect for cooler evenings out. did i mention super flattering?,1
"The print of this skirt is so fun. i love how it's styled on the model, and i could see it being very versatile. i decided not to keep it because, mainly, it is pricey and i'm afraid it'll get easily damaged. if i would wear it, i think i'd be worried about sitting on a dirty chair or spilling something on my lap and it being really visible-- and then having to upkeep it through dry cleaning. the fabric's nice and good quality. but honestly, if the skirt were cheaper and the fabric were cotton a",0
This skirt for sure was the most disappointing thing i've ever ordered from retailer. it looks like an all white skirt that has a little stiffness to it but looks are deceiving. it has this weird checkered patten and there is no shape to the skirt at all. there are also weird stitching lines. one more thing that i didn't like about the skirt was that it's a cream-ish color. not even the cute flamingos will make me keep this skirt. it's going back.,0
Love this cardigan. the quality is beautiful and and comfortable. i think the cable stitching and pockets add such a unique touch.,1
"The dress is beautiful on the model. in person it's sheer, but i could have dealt with that if the fit had been great. i am 5'4"" and the petite was too short and the regular too long. both are very boxy and seem to run big. even the size small in both petite and regular were too big on me and usually in cloth and stone size small is perfect. i really wanted to love this dress but ended up returning several sizes in my attempt to find the perfect size.",0
"I absolutely love the color, cut and style of this maxi. the high neck and drop waist are both so flattering! the color and design is gorgeous as you'd expect from rana gill. i got my normal size 8 and it was perfect. i would have expected the fabric to be a little heavier but it works as a late summer early fall dress",1
"I got this jacket after being inspired by the looks from stranger things, and love that the fuzzy collar style is coming back! i tend to wear medium shirts and large jackets/coats to fit my long arms, and the sleeves are a great length for me. the lining has a gorgeous pattern on the inside too. the buttons were difficult to button at first, but became easier over time as the fabric softened. i also bought a pilcro skirt and it's comfortable too, so overall i&#39;m very happy with this brand.",1
"I was really suprised when i received this top. it was a knit (more like a t-shirt material), which i really like. this way you can wear casual as well as dressing it up. it is not see thru at all and it stay off the shoulder. the one thing i dont like is the elastic band at top is too wide. but overall ita s keeper!",1
"I love cloth & stone clothes and have this version in a long sleeved shirt. it is a little boxy, but the weight of the fabric helps with hang of it. i love the feel of the fabric and the weight of it for a summer dress, yet it is too sheer for a summer dress. it needs a liner or little cami dress to wear under it to keep it from being see through, however, for a texas summer, that defeats the point of a loose, easy dress to throw on. i sadly sent mine back.",1
"I loved this color and ordered it online because i thought it would work for both casual and work days dressed up a little. ummmmm, no. it's weird and boxy and does not look at all like it does on the model. i think maybe if you have no bust whatsoever and size way down it would look okay. i'm only a 34b, weigh 110 pounds, 5'3"" and it made me look huge and awkward. this is going back!",0
"Love this top! i just purchased this shirt from my local retailer store. i noticed it when i walked in and saw it on display. it's stylish, comfortable, and subtle. it runs large so size down. normally, i wear a medium in retailer tops but needed a small. the flower print is small and the colors are muted against the black. pairs well with several colors: black (like model), dark denim, olive green, and mauve. the display had it tucked into a soft khaki colored pair of pants that worked as well.",1
"I purchased this top on sale and was really excited about the style. it fit great the first time i wore it. i washed it once, according to the care instructions. after washing it in cold water and allowing it to air dry, it was basically ruined. it shrunk up in length widened out about two inches. i'm pretty bummed about it because it was cute.",0
I love sundry and their fun designs--i was disappointed because the fabric is very thin and the dark part of the heart is not black but bluish slate grey. it is just not what i expected from the picture. i bought the xs and it felt baggy on the body.,0
"I couldn't resist the toucan print when i saw this online, and ordered in my normal size s (27/4 in pants, 34b bust, 5'7""). the fit is perfect - arm holes are an appropriate size (not huge like some dresses), semi-fitted and flattering, nice length for work, and the tie front is a nice detail to help define the waist. length is about the same as the model shot. i knocked off a star for quality since the fabric is not particularly breathable for summer and the zipper is a little tough in the wais",1
So despite reviewers saying this was too short i decided to try it anyways. the dress is adorable the print t g e pockets so cute but the description is incorrect. the petite falls 30 from shoulder which means it's right under your bum so you move anyway and someone gets a show. it's unfortunate because this dress is adorable. it would fit tts except length. unfortunately this one has to go back.,0
"I really love this tee! but, the fit can be boxy so i ordered it online in a size 0 and am very happy with how it fits me. i've worn it with skinny jeans and have gotten complimented repeatedly.",1
"This top is so soft, simple, and such a closet staple, if you get the right size! for reference, i am 5'3, 128 lbs, and i ordered the petite medium. it's perfect. the black is a great color, hard to describe, kind of soft with some warm blush tones. i also ordered the white and the peach. great at the sale price!!",1
"The kimono is as pictured. the colors are true to what is shown on line, though the description indicates ""green multi""--it is not green. i returned the item, however. the quality is fine, but it seemed extremely over-priced to me. it seems to me that half the price would be fair for the quality.",0
This top runs larger so size down. i love it besides that. it's adorable!,1
"This blouse has too much drapey fabric and it's just not flattering.  in the front part of the blouse the fabric is relatively short, but the sleeves have so much excess fabric it almost looks like a clown suit.  sending back.",0
"The top is nice, good quality, etc.... but how do you keep the 'off the shoulder' off the shoulder? mine keeps inching up until it's just a boring white top with a strange loose neckline.",0
"I wanted to like this top, as i usually adore a cute peplum feature. when i tried it on yesterday in the store, i was disappointed by how wide and bulky is it. i am petite (5'2"", 110 lbs), and i tried my usual xs. the fabric was substantial and of a high quality, but unfortunately in this design, that became a bad thing as the bottom of the shirt balooned out around me. it was very unflattering and i felt lost in the shirt! definitely try it on for yourself before purchasing.",0
Just got the small peach in the mail; love it. also got the black small petite; works great as this shirt is pretty long. great boho tee.,1
"I thought i would love this shirt because it goes along with my style, but i returned it immediately. it runs so large! the colors are faded, and the trim of the shirt curl over, so it looks cheap and frumpy. i do not recommend this! it hits in all the wrong places.",0
I love the way this top fits and the way it flows. i have it in two colors.,1
This is my new favorite shirt!! you can dress it up or down. so comfy and totally flattering :),1
"This is a very cute dress. it was perfect before i washed it. the problems i had after washing it was the outer cotton layer of the dress shrunk length wise while the inside black lining did not, so the black lining peeks out a good inch or two. and since the dress is shorter i can't really wear it without using biker shorts, especially for the back of the dress since it's shorter there and if i bent over you could see everything. i'm so disappointed in the quality because it is a very cute, ver",0
"This is a cute top but the fit is problematic. it runs small on top especially around the bust and sleeves but then it flares below the waist in a billowy and unflattering way with way too much fabric.
i got both an xsp and an xxsp. the xxsp fit better on bottom but i could hardly pull my arms through the sleeves. both are going back unfortunately. for reference i'm 5' 103 lbs 32b.",0
"I now have this tee in 3 colors - partly because my daughter loves and shares them with me. i typically get a size medium because i like things to fit a little loose, but needed a small in this shirt. goes great with all styles of jeans/knakis.",1
"This is a beautiful piece that looks even better in person - a nice mix of modern and artistic, with just enough color and a flattering fit. my only concern is that it may get itchy throughout the day, especially at the neckline. if you can handle a little wool blend next to your skin, i would recommend it for style and fit.",1
"This is great, lightweight top layer that's just right for the little evening chill in the summer when the sun goes down, or on a breezy day. it's sheer, so it requires a bottom layer. the medium fits a little tighter across the shoulders and arms for me than it shows on the model, which i like.",1
So you're thinking this is a red and black skirt right? nope. it's an obnoxious cherry red netting with cranberry crushed velvet insets overlaid on bright red actual spandex. spandex that shows every wrinkle and panty line. it's really god awful.,0
"I got the black in a medium. it just made me look wide and i felt frumpy. i think it's the angled wide sides. on me, the design just created bulk. nice substantial fabric but it isn't soft or cozy. back it goes",0
I wish i had read the reviews prior to purchasing. this skirt looks amazing in photos and lace appears black. the lace on mine is actually purple - at first i thought it was just purple due to lighting with red underneath - but nope - pull the netting away and it is purple. lace netting hikes up on the right due to poor craftsmanship. i ordered a medium and felt it was a bit large. will return.,0
"Love this shirt, can dress up or more casual. wish i would of purchased all colors!",1
If you are looking for the perfect t-shirt to add a little flare to your basics this is the one for you. it is so comfy and baggy yet still looking like you pulled yourself together. i am just waiting for more colors to come out. i basically live in the green and white versions of this shirt.,1
"Looks great on the model, but in actuality there is way too much fabric; what should be flowy and billowy looks like a tent (or a maternity top on a petite woman). it didn't matter which size, they all fit me disastrously. i love the look and i thought of keeping it and having it taken in, but there's too much fabric under the chest to make it an easy cut/alteration on the side seams. sometimes i wonder who comes up with these patterns, and if they pin the shirts back on the models. if you put a",0
"One of the best retailer pieces i have ever purchased!  high quality and fits true to size.  i have a large chest, and this minimizes and creates a really nice silhouette.  i highly recommend, got so many compliments i bought both colors!",1
"Such a cute top. does run slightly big, depending on how loose you want it to be. for such a simple design, the quality is great.",1
"Such a cute pattern, and i loved the fold-over design, but beware - there is not enough bottom coverage! i should've looked more closely at the photo - it's pretty accurate in showing the bathing suit bottoms have limited rear coverage. a couple more inches of fabric would've really helped. i'm used to fuller coverage bathing suit bottoms, and these just expose way more cheek than i felt comfortable with. i could maybe wear them around my husband, but definitely not my dad! i felt like if i bent",0
"I had been eyeing this top for weeks. it's look so beautiful on the model, however, not great on me. material is fab. the tee is way shorter than it appears online and there is too much flutter material.",0
"I used my birthday month discount to treat myself to this gorgeous chemise and matching robe in the mauve. the color is prettier in person than on my computer. i bought it in size m, and size m clothes are normally a little big on me. this chemise fits, but there is no extra room or looseness. i am disappointed in the quality of the pieces. i have several beautiful 100% silk undergarments that i bought for myself in the 80s and 90s, and i am comparing this chemise (& robe) to those. this silk us",1
"I'm a m/l size in most things....depending on the maker and design. i tried this vest on with the paired top in the photo and couldn't believe how big and boxy it was. very boxy. it looked dumpy on my 5'3"" frame. i thought it might work because i have broad shoulders to hang the vest off,but noooo. i have breast and that ruined it. well there you go, a size 36c wasn't going to help with this one. but i'm going to try sizing down to a small to give it a chance in fitting better. it runs at least",1
"Great sweater vest. its not too thin or too thick, just right for fall or winter when its time to start layering. the material is a nice soft knit and the zipper on the back is a great addition. its easy to put on and i don't worry about the zipper snagging the material and causing any damage. i plan on pairing it with a polka dot long sleeve shirt that i have and it looks great. i am looking forward to wearing this when the weather becomes cooler. highly recommend. i am a 36b and usually wear a",1
"The color is darker than shown (i ordered the denim looking one). the flower things are not very visible as it all looks one color. it must be great for the tall skinny model , but if your 5'4'' and pear shaped like me, it's a no go! took it back to my local store.",0
"I was very excited about receiving this dress. unfortunately i was a little disappointed when i opened the package, as the color was darker than on the picture.
i live in florida where the sun is always shining and although this dress has a beautiful simple design, it isn't for me as the color is too ""winter"".",0
"I love vests and this is a great one, warm and cute!! because it is sweater material some of the threads look like than can pull, but i still think its stylish and different and still a classic to have!",1
"Love everything about this jacket its super soft, thin, and looks great! it's versatile and a great layering piece for someone that lives in a very warm climate! prefer the sleeves to be worn rolled up and the inside belt definitely helps give the piece more shape and dimension!",1
"This skirt looks/lays exactly like the photo. i bought a size small and i usually wear a size 4. it was maybe a smidge big, but nothing that affected the look of the skirt. the material reminded me of felt/wool mixed together, almost like sunday school felt cut outs (but stiffer) (not a fan).. i was underwhelmed - it looked plain and simple, and the color washed me out. definitely not worth the price (for me anyways). good luck!",0
"I was able to try this one on at the store, and it was so loose on me, i assumed it was a large, but no, it was a small! (i usually wear size 6-8 in dress size, s/m in tops) admittedly, it does pull over the head, with no zippers or elastic to give shape. but it feels like water on the skin and has just the right amount of ""show it,"" plus coverage for wearing around the house, i'm keeping it.",1
"I bought this jacket based on how it looked on the model, and from the reviews. i found it to be super big, and unflattering to say the least. i'm 5""10, 155lbs. i sent it back.",0
"My husband bought this for my birthday. i love that it can be dressed up or worn for a more fun occasion.

i'm a tad small up top, so it fits a little too loose up there, but other than that it fits great. i'm considering getting it altered just because i love it so much.",1
When these shorts arrived i loved them and was so excited to wear them on my upcoming trip to the beach. the high rise waist is very flattering and the material was extremely soft. the floral detailing was a little more orange than in the picture but i still loved the contrast. the first time i wore these i immediately noticed threads coming loose throughout the day. it was minor but still concerning for an item that was so costly. the real problem arose in the evening when i put on a jacket on,0
"I really wanted to love this top but the other reviewers are spot on when they say it is too short and boxy. so, fresh out of the package, the ruffle hit me right at the widest part of my hips and when i raised my arms the shirt exposed my midriff. not cute. i really liked the quality though so i washed it on delicate and then tugged gently to stretch the length out and hung to dry. now, it's still a wee boxy, of course, but significantly longer and much cuter on me. so, i'm keeping. even thinki",1
"I am always on the hunt for a cute white t-shirt but this one was a miss. it is too boxy (short) and the material is very thin for the price. i gave it two stars because it has nice colors for spring/summer. for reference, i am 5'4 and 115 lbs and i ordered a small. bought it online so i ended up returning it to the store.",0
"This dress fits awfully. it's not short, as pictured in photo. it hit just above my knees. it looked like sack. i would've, also, felt like i was choking  all night with it clasped around my neck. it, potentially, may look okay on someone who is very tall, skinny, and lanky, but i have my doubts about that too.",0
"My daughter loved this tee the first time she tried it on. since then i have purchased the white, yellow/lemon and rose pink colors for her. the material is soft, it washes well and it looks great. she says these tees are some of the most comfortable she owns and it looks good with shorts, jeans and leggings.",1
"Love this dress! paid full price and completely worth it. fit tts for me- i'm 5'8"" 135 lbs., with a slim upper body so i had no issues with the neck being tight. definitely would be braless or need a strapless bra. gorgeous material, light and breezy dress. best retailer purchase in a long time!",1
"...the print is so sharking, and i love the way it looks on the model -- but i'm a more curvy figure, and the boxy-ish cut plus rather stuff fabric in front is incredibly unflattering. ordinarily i love everything made by maeve, but this one sadly must be returned... on a thinner/straighter-shaped person i expect it would be great.",0
"I love this tee shirt. i love the higher neckline and the feminine and subtle ruffle at the bottom. it is my favorite tee by far! i am buying my second round of it now. i have one in coral, light blue and i am ordering more. the only down side is that both of my current shirts developed holes veyr quickly.; one on the shoulder and the other in the usual belly area that comes from the granite counter and jeans top button. there is no excuse for the shoulder holes in my mind...but i love the look",1
This top is easy with nice hem detail.,1
"I like the cut and look of this shirt, and tried on the xs (fits 115 lbs, 30ss chest), but i find that the t-shirts lately are kind of thin and see through... the shirt is fun, and the color is adorable, but had to pass as i could see my bra too clearly for my liking.",1
"As others mentioned, love the little buttons, and the cut is flattering. i ordered the ""denim' one (multicolor). i didn't end up keeping it but will order again if goes to sale. likes: colors are fun, material is soft, buttons are beautiful, cut is decently flattering. what i didn't love is it looks wrinkled.

i ordered the xxs and xsp - only tried on xxs as i didn't think i would keep it anyway, but thinking of it, is should have still tried the xsp. arms were almost snug on me (i lift weight",1
"Beautiful color and the fabric is very substantial and soft. but, they didn't finish the bottom hem! the dress is lined and the bottom inside has a ribbon sewn in as a type of hem, but the actual edge is just cut and not turned in on itself. because of this the whole bottom had a hundred little fabric frays. the rest of the dress is so polished it just doesn't make sense. also, while the fabric is beautiful my dress had a weird mark on the chest, almost like a water mark. just overall bad attent",0
"I order from retailer regularly and am pretty consistently a 0 petite or xxs petite. i ordered this in a 0 petite and it was like 5 inches too small in the rib cage and chest area. even if i would have got it zipped up, the halter cut is cut narrow so you can't wear a bra for sure...strapless would be necessary. also, the actual neck part was tight. for reference, i am 5'3"", 108 pounds and a 32c bust. it seems you need to be flat chested to pull this one off and maybe missing a few ribs.",0
"I was so excited to receive this in the mail as it had been on backorder for awhile. the dress is beautiful, but run smalls the buttons on the back are nearly impossible to fasten. if you are single, good luck trying to get it buttoned. i'll be returning it.",0
"This is an interesting skirt. the fabric is comfortable, breathable and flowy. it is eye-catching. but the pattern is not one i would say i love, although i do like it. the lighter color in the pattern is more pink than off-white, which is fine, but that did surprise me a little. overall, i kept it for comfort and because i liked it enough for the sale price i paid for it.",1
Super cute!! will be buying another color of this tee.,1
Nice top that can be worn alone or underneath a sweater. can be dressed up or down and worn in all seasons.,1
The idea of this shirt is awesome! it just needs to be made longer and not so boxy. the ruffle is darling! i would be so happy if the the designer made some modifications. i think a lot of people would buy it then.,0
"Love the design and colors
runs a but large through the middle",1
"This is a great t-shirt; i love it. it fits great, isn't too bulky and has a great length to go with anything. i love it.",1
"Love this shirt so much i bought it in 2 different colors. the reviews said it was so boxy and plain, but i disagree. looks great with jeans or a skirt without looking looking too casual. love that they are not too long also. so many tees are soon long and these are not thank goodness.
definitely runs big",1
"I love this tee. as others have noted, the ""pink"" is really more of a coral orange, which is what i was hoping for. i wish they had another good color for a redhead because i would buy it.",1
As-advertised crop sweater is a great length. design is an iron-on velvet texture rather than intarsia. weight of sweater is great for transitional weather.,1
I love this brand and the material of these shirts and have a ton similar and thought this was adorable with the sweet detail but it is super short and boxy and i felt uncomfortable with the length on me and it also made it so it wasn't so flattering on. such a bummer cuz its a sweet spin on a plain basic tee!,0
"I have been wanting this coat ever since i tried it on in the store a month ago. it's beautiful and well-made. it fits tts, but a snug tts, so if you are between sizes, i would order up. grab this asap while the price is right and it is still available!",1
"My first complaint is, this dress is pinned back so obviously in the video that when the model turns around (not all the way), you can see the pin in the back.  that should have been a clue that this dress isn't meant to fit anyone properly if it doesn't fit the model. i agree with another reviewer that the model in the still product photos sized up and up because the dress does not fit loosely in regular size nor is it that long.  you have to have a longer torso to pull off the top, or the fabr",0
"This coat won't take me through a cold boston winter, but i will be willing to sacrifice a little warmth in order to take this beauty out for a night on the town. it's chic, slim, elongating and bold. it looks fantastic paired with some bold tall boots and solid colors underneath. as for sizing, i tend to disagree with most ""runs small"" reviews, but this baby runs small. especially if you really do live in a cold climate and intend to wear something substantial underneath. my bust measurement is",1
"I bought this shirt in a l, since i didn't want it to be too fitted and was concerned a m would be. it is so boxy! it's like a completely different shirt. i have no idea how it looks good on anyone, unless it is simply widened the larger the size. maybe a m wouldn't be as wide and therefore as boxy, but this shirt is just a bad mess. returning.",0
"I bought this tee in gray and i liked it so much, i got the pink as well. it is not see through or sheer in either of the colors that i purchased. for reference, i am 5'2"" and the shirt hit at low hip. i ordered one size up for a""swing"" look. very fresh, fun take on the basic tee. love it!",1
"I have a couple of these tanks so i thought i would try the tshirt and its even more flattering than the tanks (which i also love) great material, doesnt stretch out like you would think it would and looks great with shorts or pants.",1
"I bought this very cute t-shirt in sky. wore it once, then washed it according to the washing instuctions (machine washable/dryable). this t-shirt turned into a crop top!!!!! i can't wear it. it's going to goodwill. i would suggest that you air dry this shirt, if you want to take the chance that it won't shrink up several inches.",0
I got this shirt in light blue. i absolutely love it. i just bought it for the summer and i wore it on a day where it was 85 and it was just perfect. it is a very light material and it's very flowy so it breathes very well. i got an xs. i am 5'6 and it fits just perfectly. highly recommend!,1
This is one of those you can tell from the hanger that it's not going to work. too boxy. too short. and the girlish ruffle makes it look like an over-sized child's shirt that got all messed up in the washing machine.,0
"I knew i would keep it as soon as i put it on -- comfortable, beautiful fabric, cute gold buttons!  as well, due to the cut, it feels roomy, but has a slender fit around the arms.  the ""denim"" color has beautiful detail, but i don't think i would like the maroon solid.  i wish there was another nonsolid color -- i would buy another one!",1
This dress you will want to try on in the store. it is very thick and stiff fabric. the whole front is embroidered and the big drawback for me is that waist seam. there is absolutely no give in that waist. this is not stretchy fabric and not easy for just any body type to wear. sad because it is very pretty on the rack!,0
"This was a rare full-price purchase for me. i do think that it runs slightly large, but that is part of the ""look"" of this dress. i considered sizing down to an xs for more definition at the waist, but they didn't have one in store so i decided to stick with my regular s. i look forward to wearing this with sandals while summer is still sweltering, but i also think it will transition well with tights, boots, and a cardigan when temps start cooling off.",1
"Pictures don't do this dress justice, color in store is much more vibrant! embroidered flower is more orange/coral colored. also, at certain angles (depending on the lighting) this dress looks navy blue versus black, which i enjoyed. sizing - while i could have gotten away with my usual 8 the side view was too voluminous and somewhat unflattering so i ended up sizing down to a 6 for a more tailored look.",1
"This is a soft, comfortable shirt. it fits like a t-shirt should. i usually buy m but based on other reviews i purchased s. the fit on me in size small is similar to the model in the photo.",1
"I love the idea of ruffles, but this shirt was huge! i normally wear a small or medium, and i got the small. it felt more like a large to me. maybe if you size down 1-2 sizes, it will work out for you. i'm going to take it back rather than exchange. i also wish it was a more lightweight material for summer, but it's pretty thick.",0
"I'm an xl in retailer tops, and the xl in this blouse fit nicely. tops from tiny can sometimes be really tiny, but this blouse is cut correctly for it's size. i'm full figured and busty and the xl fit comfortably. if you're athletic or have a petite bust or are slender you might be able to size down.

the neckline is really beautiful and unique, and the shirt material is soft. the front is a very pale lavender, and the sleeves and back of the blouse are gray. there is a pale lavender lining fo",1
"I like this top because it covers the bum.  it is a little longer in the back than front.  it is cotton modal soft, and it is light enough for summer.  the ruffles add nice flow and fun detail. i bought this piece because it will make a nice top to wear in the summer, but classier than a tank top.  i also knew it would make a nice layering piece under a sweater in the winter.  i buy all my clothing pieces now based on versatility, material (for comfort), and classical style.",1
"I really wanted to love this dress, but it just didn't fit in anyway. i ordered an xs petite, and it was very large. the lacing in the back is completely useless, and that's what i liked about the dress. i was thinking it would be unlaced more at the top (because of chest) and then lace more tightly near the waist. it was completely closed off and the dress was still very loose and unflattering. beautiful fabric, great color combo, bad fit.",0
"This dress has the same bold, great color as the picture. although it has a big ""swing"" to it, because the upper portion is a bit fitted, i don't feel like i look pregnant. the material is extremely well done and i like the above the knee styling. i'm very happy i bought it.",1
"This skirt and top is nothing like the picture. the skirt is black not maroon. top is also black. although the skirt is nice, the image was fabulous. the side panels of the skirt are also a knit. quality is good but skirt is overpriced for what it is. would have expected suede or leather panels for the money. not sure if going to keep or not. was really looking for the maroon color instead of the black.",1
"Is it possible to be in love with a dress? i think so and i am. when i put this dress on it literally took my breath away. it is beautiful and very well-made. this dress is so fun! i wore it to an event this past weekend and received more compliments than i ever have on something i'm wearing. this beauty is so incredibly comfortable and bonus - it has pockets! i am a petite 4 and it runs very true to size for me. in the store, it looked more navy than black, but as i have it home, it is definite",1
I loved this shirt until the first time i washed it. it shrunk so much it became unwearable. when i returned it the salesperson said she had also bought this shirt and the same thing happened.,0
The dress is too loose and runs too big,0
"I was so excited to find this shirt on sale at my local retailer store. but, i did not notice the high percentage of rayon in the fabric, which caused the shirt to shrink significantly in the wash (even when following washing instructions). i washed it on cold with woolite and it is about half the length it was initially! i'm so disappointed. how can you make a shirt that can't withstand washing?!",0
Wish i would have read the reviews before i purchased and wore two of these. washed as directed and same outcome as everyone else. basically unwearable unless i maybe use it for a nightshirt. the shrinkage lengthwise was ridiculous. glad i didn't buy every color like i had planned to do!,0
So disappointing! everything i've owned from bordeaux has washed well and stood the test of time. one wash and this was ruined! shrunk terrible even after washing in cold water on delicate and laying flat to dry. completely ruined. returned it.,0
"Stunning! i got about 6 compliments the day i wore it. 2 different men i barely know said ""you're really rocking that outfit."" 

i wish they made this in petite as the xs is slightly big (i'm 5'3"" 106 lbs) but i kept it anyway since i'm both a little underweight right now and also since i was able to roll the top so that it was an appropriate length to wear with flats. 

i paired with a denim shirt- perfection.",1
This top is very cute but runs large. i am a 32b and i had to take the xsmall. the back of the bathing suit only has one slot for closing it up so you can't adjust it.,1
It's a cute top but once i washed in cold water and laid flat to dry it shrunk and lost it's shape. very disappointed. i am going to return top.,0
"I purchased the dress on a promotion.  the dress i received had the sleeves end about the elbow.  i added a 4"" black cotton lace to the sleeves.  i love the result.  it makes the design richer and brings out the lace running down the front of the dress.  the sleeves are a much better length for me now.  dress runs tts.  i purchased a medium, am 5'7"", 150 lbs, really am large boned, straight up and down.",1
"I loved this top when i wore it! it draped beautifully. i always snatch up all of bordeaux t-shirts because of the way they hang. but beware - you must dry this flat. i've always had no problem washing and drying their t-shirts, but this one shrunk up to half it's size the first time i washed it and is no longer wearable. it does say on tag lay flat to dry and they mean it!",0
I thought this would be cute with leggings based upon the length on the model. i forget that the models are almost 6 feet tall. this has a polyester slip goes under it that snaps onto the shoulders. it came down to my knees and was completely like a sack no leggings and boots with this one. lovely material but not at all figure flattering.,0
"I loved this shirt so much i bought it in 4 colors. however, two of them shrunk. i was very disappointed.",0
"I just bought this dress in the store and i absolutely love it except for one thing. why are the sleeves on the actual dress so much shorter than the picture with the model? i suspect the model has long arms, not little t-rex arms, so why does the sleeve hit at the top of her wrist, while my lovely dress hits just past my elbow. it's a mystery. was the pictured item not what the store took delivery of? anyway, still a great dress, just trying to figure out if i should add lace or something to ma",1
"Let me start off by saying i never write reviews, but feel compelled to so that no one else gets swindled into buying this beautiful one-time wear piece. i absolutely fell in love with this shirt when i bought it in the fall in black... perfect basic to wear under my new draped open vest from retailer! and perfect fit! i'm long torso-ed and long armed and always have trouble with fit. this being kind of oversized was just loose enough and long enough i could actually feel comfortable wearing it wi",0
"This one didn't work for me. there is no zipper, you climb into it from the very large neck hole. it was very low cut and the shoulders kept sliding off but the bottom half fit snug. the tie and waist seam didn't hit at my waist but the largest part of my middle. i tried other belts and it wasn't much better. the fabric and print were great. i love jumpers but this one went back.",0
"I loved this shirt when i got it. it fit perfectly, and was so soft. but when i washed it, following the instructions, it shrank up to well above my belly button. i'm talking 6 inches of shrinkage, at least.",0
I saw this dress online and thought it might be an adorable eclectic piece to add to my closet. and was i right. the simple shape mixed with the bold pattern make this dress an awesome one to own. its easy and fun and funky. plus it has hidden pockets! beware though this dress seems to run a bit small. i would say if you switch in between sizes like me i can be a 6 or an 8 then possibly go with the larger size. i do have a large bust as well i wear a 34ddd so it shows some clevage but the girls,1
"After reading all the reviews i figured at 40% off i could at least try it. i'm 5' 3"" and typically wear a m or size 10. i ordered the m, but as other reviews stated the arms were tight. since i'm expecting it to shrink, and want it to cover my booty, i ordered 2 colors in the l. it's exactly the oversized, slouchy look i wanted, without the neckline being too low, but will still be ok if it shrinks. i'll have these dry cleaned to minimize shrinkage. it's a wardrobe staple that looks great with",1
Bought two of these because i loved the way they fit off of the rack. washed them according to directions and they were ruined. the material shrank up making the shirt short and boxy and the side panels ended up being rippled. definitely going to try to return these.,0
I first saw this dress in one of the stores and the rich colors caught my eye. this dress is very comfortable to wear but is also unique. the fabric feels great on and gives the dress an overall stylish flair. the photo doesn't do it justice!,1
"I purchased this shirt in a medium, in the wine color. i love the drape and fit of the shirt. it has a laid back vibe and the material is supper soft and comfy. it is also a bit more substantial than some of the thinner shirts i've bought at retailer. you could easily dress this up or down. i wore this shirt a couple times and then machine washed it on cold on a delicates cycle and dried it flat. it majorly shrunk! now i can't wear it because the length shrank at least an inch or more. if you purc",0
"When the top arrived and i tried it on; it was great. the length was perfect even though i am curvy. after one wash (done according to the directions), the top shrank in length considerably. i do not mind paying a higher price for something unique and something of quality.....i do have a problem with something that does not hold up to basic use. i will be returning this item.",0
Loved this dress but ran much larger than other maeve dresses i have ordered in the past!,1
"I tried on and bought this shirt in my usual size and it fit long and loose but still had great shape. after hand washing in cold water and air drying, as per instructions on the tag, the shirt shrunk significantly. so much so that my stomach shows if i raise my arms at all. it also lost its shape, and now looks very boxy and is very unflattering. i won't be wearing it and am disappointed i didn't even get to wear it once!",0
I wear cardigans pretty much every day since my office is chilly and i need something a little dressier to be able to wear that will keep me warm. i love the design of this cardigan which makes it very flattering-the longer in front is a style i gravitate toward and i like that the back isn't just straight but it has that little flair-this is not something that is commonly seen in a cardigan (unless it is short all the way around) and it was great attention to detail by the designer. i like the,1
This product runs either really small or is super high waisted. either way not for me.,0
"I wanted to love this top. unfortunately, the color & fit didn't work for me. i'm a 36ddd. the fit was ok, it even flattered my bust, i just felt the stripes didn't flatter my waist. this would be perfect for an athletic frame.",1
"I tried this on as it was on sale and my size was on the store. i didn't end up buying it as it felt jsut meh compared to so many cute cardigans. i do have a couple of grey ones and tried on grey, so perhaps i jsut dind't need it... pros: short so would work with dresses and high waist.",1
"I wasn't sure about the color but ordered based on how much my stylist loved it. my usual xs petite fits perf daly, no chest problem (30dd) and the length is quite nice. romantic look, the drawstring in the back helps making sure the dress fits properly at the waist. it is a high low style with flowy skirt. overall great. i need to stop going to the store""",1
"This sweater looked so promising with the tie waist and pretty lacy edging, but turned out to be a disappointment. it was much shorter than it looks in the photos and barely came to my hips. and the plum color was much darker than i expected, more of a dull brownish-burgundy.",0
"I ordered the blue in size xl. it's even prettier in person. the fit runs a little smaller/shorter on me than shown on the model. i'm 5 ft. 5 1/2 in. for reference. i love the detailed stitching. it is delicate and can catch. my dog's claw pulled on it and i had to reweave the thread back. i've washed mine twice, reshaped & air-dried. it didn't shrink much at all. it's perfect for spring & summer. i've gotten a lot of compliments on the shade of blue. it's really so pretty.",1
"I was hesitant to try this top on because i thought it might be too tight, and then was delighted to find that it is so comfortable and flattering. i am usually a m and the m fit me great. i have to disagree with another reviewer that this top is for those of us b cup or smaller. i am a d and it fit me great. it's got enough give and support (great fabric and wrap design) to fit a wide range of bust lines. it's a great blend of being attractive without being too revealing. i love it. got it in b",1
"I'm about 5'9"" and this sweater was too short for me. the arm length was great but the overall length was just too short :-( i'll be returning this one.",1
"I purchased this to wear in spring and summer for work or in the evening. i am 5'8"" and have actual measurements of 29"" ribcage and 33"" at largest part of my bust. i wear a 32c/d bra. i found this dress fit me perfectly in the bust and the darts on the front create a flattering shape. i was disappointed in the waist at the back. from the photos, it is not clear that there is a drawstring waist cord. i thought this made the back look bunchy. i would have much preferred a side zip so the back coul",1
"Just didnt like the fit. it ""puffed out"" in front, so that wasnt very flattering. i have an hourglass shape, and this was not a good fit for me.",0
"The print on this dress is really pretty and the styling with the lace is a nice touch. unfortunately, it runs quite small in the bust, so i had to return it. for someone that is small busted, it will be quite cute. everywhere else it is true to size.",0
"I wanted to love these, but they're so tight around the top. my legs are normal size and i couldn't get them above my knee. the top isn't stretchy...it has a string that keeps it from expanding. they are so very cute, but unfortunately must go back for me.",0
"This very lightweight cardigan looked like an eggplant color online. it's brown with a hint of burgandy. not bad, but unexpected. i am very short -waisted, and this lies very high on my torso. the seams are unfinished, and it looks cheaply made. glad i got this on sale.",0
"Tried it on a whim and could not leave it behind. 5/4', 135, size 4-6, took a 6. something about the pocket placement, fabric weight, cut, and color make this one a real winner for me. plan to wear it with a creme windowpane coat.",1
"This top is the bomb. the red is a perfect balance of washed out but still rich. the thin spaghetti straps and scooped back make it sexy, but it still looks effortless. perfect to pair with light weight, light wash jeans. it's also nice that it's not clingy at all, lends to the casual look. total keep for me.",1
On the mannequin this looked adorable. it is made well but if you have any bustline it just billows out below like a tent and is not flattering. if it had less fullness it would have been really cute.,0
"I wanted this top to work so bad. unfortunately the way the bust of the top is designed it isn't flattering if you aren't flat chested. it squishes on side of your chest and leaves the other side alone. i'm a b cup and had this problem so if you are a b or larger, i don't recommend. however, if you are smaller busted, this piece would be worth the purchase.",1
"Did not work for me. material was a bit thin, poor quality, the tie doesn't quite work correctly. had a cheaper look to it. not the quality i'd normally expect. this is going back.",0
I have the moss colored pilcro skirt that is out right now in an 8 and love everything about it. ordered this in an 8 and it is tight! sending it back. it is very pretty though. just don't love enough to exchange for correct size.,1
"I wanted to love this dress so much, but unfortunately it ran way too big for my taste. i am usually a 4/6 in retailer, and the small was huge on me. the bottom half of the dress is very much a ""swing"" dress and is very wide, much wider than it looks in the pictures. i suppose that sizing down (maybe even to a petite), and having the dress altered to be narrower on the bottom half would've made it look like the picture, but that's a lot of extra work for a dress that is already pretty pricey.",0
"It seemed to stay in place and did not require constant readjustment. however, i found the band to be extremely small and tight. it is not the most comfortable bra because of the way the band just presses into your skin.",0
"This is a great sweater that i know i'll get a ton of use out of! i've already worn it three times, and i've had it a week. i typically wear small or medium in tops and sweaters, and ordered a medium in this one to ensure the arms were comfortable. the nude color is perfect.",1
"I love this sweater. i purchased it in the red/berry color. it is so incredibly soft and cozy and the fit is fantastic! it hugs my curves in all the right places! i purchased it without even looking at the care instructions. but, after reading a couple of reviews here, i opted to wash on delicate and line dry. it came out perfectly!",1
"I have a long list of criteria for this sort of a top. the lace can't be too fragile, the top can't be too see through, it can't bind my arms in an uncomfortable way and it can't be dry clean only. the stars have aligned on this one! i bought my usual size 2 and it fits tts. i only wish it was a little longer but i will probably wear it layered with a long cami. it certainly seems worth it for full price.",1
"I've only worn the sweater a handful of times, but i'm already in love with how soft and comfortable it is. it's a bit on the baggier side, but that doesn't stop it from looking great. i've gotten complements on it every time i've worn it. i would highly recommend it to people who don't like the typical scratchy/itchy textiles.",1
"I wear this top all the time! perfect with jeans and can't wait to wear with a skirt in the summer.
i am 5'2 and have the xs which hits in a great length, just as pictured. i bought at full price, so for the sale price you are getting a great deal!",1
"I am always a fan of retailer cardigans, but this one exceeded my expectations. the quality is a work of art, especially the back and the color, i chose the green, is so unique and beautiful. you will not be disappointed, go for it!",1
"I technically measure to a medium in both regular and petite sizing, but i took a chance an ordered the regular small in red. it is as depicted, and i agree that it is soft and can be clingy, but the regular size fits slightly too big on me. this is fine since it would show lumps otherwise. i bet this would be perfect had the petite size have been available. nonetheless, the fabric is substantial enough that it doesn't show the fact i carry weight in my upper body and stomach, so i'm keeping it.",1
I got this in the royal blue.it is absolutly beautiful.,1
Loved the fit. the size was true and it felt so soft on.,1
"In both senses, it is pretty and big and pretty big. i ordered the xs as the xxs and xs petite were both out, and it is to big on me. i am usually xs petite or xs, if shorter. i definitely need xxs (petite or not).
(115 lbs, 30 dd, 26-27 inch waist)

that being said, it is really cute and fun and flirt, but not romantic flirty, just girl next door flirty.
the navy and white stripes are classic, so will last over the seasons. the cut is flattering, i really love it, just not on me being that",1
"I ordered this shirt in each color and different sizes: petite, regular, ""my"" size, a size up and one down!

verdict: i ended up in regular size, not petite because i felt the petite was jsut that short and i could feel te cold breeze in the store. i could have gone in the 00, 0, and 2 #2 is my usual size#, but ended up in a 0 only because it was less wide on me. it is, hwoevcer a tiny bit tighter around the back if i cross my arms forward #really, i don't do that move on a daily basis#. colr: i",1
I love this top so much i bought it in 3 colors. the material is so soft and comfortable. has a slight fitting in the waist to make it very flattering. you can wear the next as pictured or button it up and slouch it and it looks great both ways. perfect with jeans or dress it up with slacks. just wish it wasn't dry clean only.,1
"Got this for work (my style is casual to boho) and it turned out to be my go-to cardigan.
the color is soft and pretty. it drapes perfectly. got the x-small
and it fits beautifully. plus, the weight of the knit is just right for
chilly evenings. would love to have it in more colors!",1
"Loved this top online but when i tried it on it was shorter than expected so only fitting for high waisted bottoms and much more boxy than it appeared online. i wish to high heaven that this top came in a more ""normal"" cut. hip length and slimming, the fabric and collar are beautiful!",0
"This top is lace done extremely well, i love the silk, the double attached layer, and the length. dress it up or down, this top is a definite show stopper.
it does run small in the arms though, size up!",1
Lovely drape and design. true to size. more of a muted crimson/brick color.,1
"I ordered the blue in size 16. it ran at least two, if not three, sizes too small compared to my other retailer 14 & 16 blouses. it was too small through the body, other than the peplum. the arms were tight too. the waistline and length matched the online photos. it's widening. the material they chose was also scratchy and rough, especially around the neckline. i returned mine after trying it on and seeing there was no way to make this work. the blue color was gorgeous though. the patterned lace w",0

"Loved the look, fit and styling of this turtleneck. but dry clean only, you have to be kidding?",0
"I love the coziness of this sweater. i do think it is designed for a looser fit, but i sized down for a closer fit. the sleeve design is unique and flattering i think, kind of of like a cap sleeve would be if you were wearing a long sleeve shirt under it. i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it does shed some, but has so many other positive features that i am keeping it and plan to wear it with lighter colors so i don't need to worry about it.
just lovely really, love the blue color especially",1
"This is the 2nd time i've purchased a dolan top and returned it b/c it was dry clean only. both tops were what i consider to be casual tops to be worn with a pair of jeans, running errands, etc. i do not dry clean this kind of casual shirt. it is made out of rayon, and that's the problem i think.

i purchased this in the wine color and it is a lovely color, hangs nicely, doesn't cling. the sleeves are a bit long but i could live with that -- i just pushed them up. as a turtleneck, it was a bit l",0

I didn't think it was that cute in the picture online but when i saw it in the store i was in love!  i am typically a medium and this was true with this.  i have a 34dd chest and you can wear a strapless easily with it and it doesn't show. i am going to wear it for a cocktail party but it would work with flip flops too.  just love it so happy i went into the store and saw it.,1

"Lovely sweater. it fits baggy and form fitted somehow. i like the multi-fabric look. however, the main body of the sweater does shed!!! like, i just held it up to my body to look at it in the mirror and the shirt i had on was covered. haven't washed it yet, so can't speck to that, but i'm guessing it will lose some of that in the wash.",1
"I bought this shirt in black and it goes with everything. definitely runs large-i have big boobs and bought the xl and returned it for the large which was even still a bit too big (long running in the sleeves) though i was comfortable with keeping it. it's a soft, comfortable shirt. the snap detail is quirky and allows multiple looks/ styling. i love the shirt and i'm glad i got in on it while i did.",1

"Didn't like at all. itchy fabric, looked good on model but on on busty girl.",0
"I loved this but didn't realize it has mohair which agitated my contacts. i had to return it. if you don't have that problem, this goes great with leggings or jeans.",1
"Great layering top! love the color- grey striped, matches almost anything. the sizing is perfect and the material is nice and think but not so chunky that it adds pounds to your frame. interesting detail with the snap neck looks sporty and jeeps it from being just another basic turtleneck.",1

This thing sheds so much it's almost unuseable but i used an entire roll of sticky roller and got it to the point where i could wear it with only a glob of fuzz on my underwear not other people's couches. it's cute and fits well other than that. buy a sticky roller!,0
"This dress is so flattering on, i was astounded. often the ""waistline"" in the petite dress are very high, even though i'm only 5'1"" tall, but this one hit at the right place and the skirt made me feel slim and tall. the fabric feels silky and the pattern is nice, but it is a pretty conservative style and perhaps a bit dark for spring. would be great for work, or church, but unfortunately doesn't really fit my lifestyle and i personally prefer a more unique style for the price. i highly recommend",1
"I bought the sweater in nude, and it fits perfectly. it is so much better than a standard cardigan- it has beautiful details. its drapes so well across your body, and it longer in the front than the back which makes it hang beautifully. i wear this to work, but would definitely wear this on the weekends for more casual outfits- its very versatile.",1
"I bought this sweater in dark grey in the store. i really loved it at first - it's very soft and cozy and fits really well. i especially like that it's long enough to cover my tummy and butt when i wear skinny jeans or leggings. however, the other reviews that mention it gets fuzz all over the place are accurate. i doubt i would have bought this if i had read them first. it even has dark grey fuzz in the inside of the sleeves. however, my biggest disappointment is that after just one wearing, th",0
"I ordered this top in ivory in 2 sizes, because i'm in between and it looks so great in the photos and didn't want to risk it selling out while i debated sizing. i really loved the larger size because the material is not stretchy and i didn't want the sleeves to be tight when i move. it is somewhat boxy on the seam at the waist so i'm having it taken in a little so it fits more like a peplum and flares. adding a skinny belt just didn't distribute the excess fabric as i envisioned. it really is a",1
"The colors are so much brighter than pictured. although the sweater is very comfortable, i did not like the color combination. i will be returning it.",0
"Unfortunately i didnt read the fine print when i ordered this re: dry cleaning only, but this in itself wasnt a total deal breaker. it did fit well -- i am 5'2, 32c, 107 lb and the xs petite fit very well, definitely form-fitting, not long in the arms or waist. the grey heather design was not my favorite look, actually thats the main reason i am returning it -- there was a dark grey splotch of the heathered design on the chest, and it looked like i had a huge dark stain.",0
"Beautiful top, i love the peplum. the color is actually cream with blush accents in the lace. i gave it two stars for quality because the hem was uncut and unfinished so it's going back.",1
"This is such a gorgeous and unique turtleneck from retailer. my favorite color is the nude and buttoned neck is really pretty. i'm 5'1 and 105 pounds and i got the small since i liked the longer length and did not want it too clingy. it is a personal preference but you may want to go up a size. as for the dry cleaning, i washed this on delicate cycle without dryer and it came out perfect. love this!",1
"And not in a good way. everywhere i went, i left a little of this sweater behind. within hours of having it on, i was picking balls of fabric off the couch, bed, and the sweater itself looked like it was molting. great style, fabric and fit (although a little on the long side,) but there's no way i can keep it.",0
"I love this top. i ordered it in a large thinking it would be a tight rib but it is not so i reordered it in a small. i am 5'7"" 145lbs 34g chest. the small fits perfectly and probably could have taken an xs. it is stretchy but fits wonderfully. i bought the black. i love how the neck snaps and adds a little pizzazz to a simple black turtle neck. i'm wearing it today with straight leg jeans and my leopard print ballet flats. i feel like audrey hepburn!! i will not be dry cleaning it. i will wash",1
"I absolutely adore this top! it is so versatile and looks equally beautiful with jeans as with dressier, skinny pants. i bought this to wear for our holiday photos and have gotten so much use out of it. worth every penny. i have just ordered the blue version and cannot wait to get it.",1
"I love these jeans so much i have 4 pairs. i bought pink and gray last year and then black and denim this year. i am 5'4"" 112 lbs. with a slim, straight, athletic build. these jeans look amazing on; they don't have those funny crease rolls in the legs because the legs weren't cut right, i don't have to tug on the waist to get them to stay up and they are just very flattering on. sometimes when i try on skinny jeans, they fit funny around the waistband and make my hips look weird. not these, i ju",1
"I bought these on sale and they quickly went back. i was very disappointed after reading the reviews. i thought for sure these would be a winner. however, i was sadly mistaken. i ordered another pair of jeans, the same, from a different brand. these were way too small while my others were too large. they didn't live up to my expectation and were still rather long. even though i bought these on sale, i was not happy with the quality.",0
Perfect way to add warmth in transition weather,1
"The chevron pattern on the mint/seaside version needs to be centered in the front to look right. mine was totally off so i returned it and had them overnight me a new one to my vacation address. unfortunately, the 2nd suit i received was also ""off center"". that one is going back too. would have loved this otherwise! a quality check on this is definitely needed.... beware.",0
"Great jeans!!! i'm over 60 & it's difficult finding jeans. these fit like a glove, with just enough stretch & the twisted hem adds a bit of unexpected style. i liked them so much, i ordered another pair!",1
Beautiful dress.  the  printed material under the tulle however hung 3 inches lower than the tulle skirt. i had to take it to the cleaners and have it hemmed to match the length of  tulle skirt because it looked awkward. even after paying full price for the dress i didn't mind spending the extra money to have it hemmed because the dress is that beautiful.,1
"I wanted to love this dress. i ordered an xsmall and a small. i am 5'6"" and 110 lbs, slender build. the xsmall fit great everywhere but the waist band was completely out of portion for the dress. both sizes will have to be returned. possibly if you have a more straight up and down figure it will fit better and pull in your waist!",0
"I think these are amazing for anyone over, say, 5'5"". the way these hung on me (at 5'2"") were very unflattering in the front. they had an unfortunate masculine effect to them. that's all i can say without being crass.",0
"I purchased this swimsuit in the mint. gorgeous color combination. i'm 5'5"" and weigh 117 lbs. i purchased a small. the fit is true to size. i love the front design; however, my husband promptly brought the back of the swimsuit to my attention. the chevron was off center. the design should have been centered with my back; however, it was on the right side of my back. i immediately called retailer assuming the product was defective. the item was sold out on line; however, a supervisor was able to l",0
"I love these pants so much, i have them in two colors. they are super comfy, light and actually really chic. perfect cool girl pants. i have got so many compliments. my young students (4-5) love my ""ninja pants""! i got them on sale. great, great buy. i highly recommend them.",1

Super cute dress but the waist band is very large and bulky.,0
"I love the print and style of the skirt. it is very cute and feminine and can easily be worn into autumn. the downside is that the elastic waist is a little too loose and needs to be tighten. also, the is a lot of extra fabric in the skirt and makes it look so much larger than it is and it runs about 3 inches longer. for reference, i'm 5'5, 34 24 35 and the xs is loose in the waist. still, i really love the skirt and plan on keeping it and having it altered.",1
"The skirt is lovely, has beautiful colors , and the touch of lace takes it to that ultra feminine level. it's a lot of skirt---yards of material and i like that it is fully lined, but this creates a problem, the source of the only negative thing i have to say about it. the only criticism i have is with the waistband---it's much too flimsy to stay up on the waist because of the weight of the skirt. i had my seamstress add a heavier weight elastic band inside the one it has or the skirt would star",1
"I cannot begin to tell you how much i love these jeans. i have been searching everywhere for the right pair of black jeans, and this is it. they run a little small and don't have as much give as regular pilcro jeans: i am normally a 28 in pilcro and i purchased these in a 29. the fit is wonderful and they keep their shape beautifully.",1
Absolutely wonderful! they fit like a dream. you could dress them up or down. i'll probably live in these jeans forever.,1
"I was intrigued by this vest on-line but really wanted to try it on first before i purchased it. stopped into my local retailer store today and was happy to see they had it in stock. i am typically a 10/12 and purchased this in the m/l. this picture does not give the vest justice in terms of the way it falls, which to me is what makes a vest a success or not. also, the colors are great. i was wearing a cream sweater and black pants when i tried it on, went great with those colors but i think it wi",1
I have never tried this brand before and was pleasantly surprised at the fit! i especially like the button detail as it makes them a little more dressy and different. i plan to wear with a simple white tank and sandals. i will definitely look for this brand again!,1
I have this in another color and it is my absolute fav! transform any outfit! it has an over-sized fit.,1
"I love the way these jeans look and fit, but they have a chemical smell. i assumed the odor would go away after i washed them, but it doesn't seem to have helped.",0
"I really love this shirt. the cutouts make it unique and the fabric is super soft for a chambray style. i thought the fit was perfect - i'm 5'5"", 120lbs and i ordered an xs. still enough room to be comfortable. super cute! glad i bought it.",1
The shirt is mostly a thick sweatshirt material and is very short when trying on - undershirt required to make up for length and the see through mesh in the pattern.  felt about 1 size too small as well,0
I am 5 6' and 130 pounds and ordered this in an xs. the sweater is enormous. the material is also scratchy and not soft at all. i'm disappointed with retailer's sizing this year. i've had to return a # of xs items because they are huge. really disappointing.,0
"Love the contrast of fabrics, thick and thin. comfy like a favorite sweatshirt but with style. can be worn both, on a night out or curled up on the sofa watching a movie at home.",1
"I would have never purchased this jacket based on the photo displayed here. it looks like something my grandma would wear. in person, however, this jacket is so versatile. the fabric moves with your body,and the ties at the bottom in the back and inside at the waist can be cinched to give it the look you want. i purchased this to wear with the weekend widelegs (which i also adore), and it's absolutely perfect. color goes with everything. i'll wear it with boyfriend jeans in the fall, too. great",1
"I love, love this trench! i bought the grey, and it goes well with so many other pieces! i can dress it up for work or wear it out for brunch on the weekend. it's a great layering piece for the san francisco weather i'm adjusting to!

it does run a little big, but i don't mind because it gives enough room for layering. i'm short at 5'3 but still stuck with a small-- a small petite probably would look great as well!

hei hei consistently makes great jackets/trenches :)",1
"I wanted this dress so much, i ordered it twice. both times the zipper was defective--it would get stuck midway up, at the waistline--so i had to send it back (there isn't an retailer in my area). this is a shame because it's got great colors and looks flattering on, and i was looking forward to pairing it with a cardigan/boots for fall. i even thought about taking it to a seamstress to have the zipper replaced, but the cost didn't seem worth it. too bad, as it seems like it would be a nice",0
"This is such a gorgeous shade of indigo! i was instantly attracted to it! upon trying on, i was surprised at how soft the fabric was. definitely a cozy sweatshirt feel in disguise! i love the peplum detailing and found the xs to be just right in length to my hip and everywhere else! i can't wait for it to cool off here in new england so i can wear this beautiful top!! i anticipate many compliments on s lovely top!!",1
Wow this is a keeper. love how soft and special the color feels. the knit for back and arms makes it very comfy and easy to wear. not really easy to layer it since arms pretty fitted. love it with jeans since the back ends at waist.,1
Beautiful dress for those with a large chest and small waist. sadly i am not one and needed to return the dress. fabric is heavy and the pattern is great.,1
"The colors on this top are beautiful, even more vibrant than the online picture. i was so excited to try it on. the problem is with the fitting. it's too short and too loose. you can see in the picture that the shirt isn't even tucked in and it barely hits the hips. as much as i wanted it to work, back it goes.",0
"I like the design of the dress, but the fabric makes it look cheap. for an expensive dress, i had expected better quality.",0
This dress is absolutely darling! it is light as a feather and floats on the body. the fabric looks almost handpainted and fits like a dream. i disagree with the previous poster and i think it looks very rich. super comfortable and i know i'll get lots of wear out of it. you can dress it up or dress it down. love it!,1
"Beautiful fabric with soft drape. unfortunately the ""captain kangaroo"" pockets are awful. unless you have a straight up and down shape with no hips this is very unflattering. the pockets look like saddle bags and add a huge amount of fabric where most people don't want added bulk. very disappointing. returned.",0
"I bought this online with the intention of it being my graduation dress. i'm 5'2"", 115 pounds so i should've known better and gotten a ""petite"" style dress. however, i loved the modern look of this and since my boobs are a bit bigger (34d) i figured they would help fill it out. upon receiving the dress, i was first shocked that for the price, the construction was pretty poor quality: there were strings coming out of the straps and they looked unevenly sewn. when i put it on, it was clear that th",0
"Soft, pretty design and perfect length. i'm 5'6"" and the m fit perfectly!'",1
I tried this on at my local store and immediately had to buy it. the picture does not do it justice. it drapes wonderfully in front and sticks out a bit at the pockets to give some added personality. fabric is very soft and light weight. highly recommend!,1
"As other reviewers have pointed out, this jacket is way prettier in person than it is in the photos. i can wear it with just about anything. the fabric is soft and lightweight, and drapes really nicely. my only complaint is the photos make the taupe jacket look like it has just a hint of peach/mauve, but in person it's a pretty standard beige. i would have liked that hint of color.",1
"I am short waisted and i still thought the pleats started too high on me. also, the whole thing was a little bit big. i always wear a medium, but in this top the shoulders and everything was just a bit large. since i bought it online, i couldn't size down. the fabric was a nice quality.",0
"I do not understand all the great reviews but that goes to show everyone likes different things! the jacket looks great in the pictures but in person, it just looks awful! gray is one of my favorite colors but this color is so drab and the material looks old and worn. it definitely has a grunge look to it and overall, it is just a wrinkly mess. another reviewer said it looks like old clothes and i have to agree. it looks very shabby. it also reminds me of those smocks they have at the hair salon",0
"I do not understand how a couple people gave this a bad review. i loved this jacket from the minute i tried it on. cute in the picture and cuter on, because it is so comfortable. the fabric is super soft and does not wrinkle (as one reviewer stated). i took it on the plane with me just to keep warm and it was fabulous. looked as good going on the plane as it did coming off. the drape of the jacket flows nicely and i love the oversized pockets to stash my phone or lipstick. this jacket will carry",1
"This top looks much nicer on the model than in-person. i tried it on, it didn't look flattering and was shorter than i like. in the picture i really like the top with the design and frills on the side, gives the model a waist. in-person the design doesn't stand out much and the frills look wrinkled.it is also sweatshirt material and a tad stiff. i am sending it back. it just didn't look as flattering. also, it seemed more fitted at the top than bottom.",0
"This over-sized sweater is light-weight and scratchy. i knew it would fit big, but the neck is overly bulky. the color is a bright blue as depicted in the picture. fits a little larger (on me) than on the model. i'm petite so it overwhelmed me.",0
This was a nice surprise because it's a thick sweatshirt type of fabric. don't be deterred! it is nothing like a sweatshirt. it's comfy like a sweatshirt though. i'm 5 feet tall 120 pounds. i ordered my usual size petite small and it fit perfectly. what little height i have is in my torso. i didn't find that the top was short at all. it's without a doubt tts. order your usual size. if you have a tummy or bootie this top is the ticket! the description on the fabric details that the other reviews,1
"I went into retailer looking for a specific dress and had to try this on when i saw how lovely it looked displayed at the store. it is a beautiful dress. not see through at all. substantial weight, not to heavy and so very beautiful. i stayed tts on it . i would have purchased it but was buying 3 other dresses.. i may go back as it will be perfect for the hot summer days.",1
"Very disappointed in this top. i have a short waist, and it was still too short for me. :-(",0
"I just bought this dress as it went on sale recently. i read all the other reviews - and, imho, the dress is ivory not yellow as another reviewer suggested. i am only 5'2"" and weigh 115llbs - there were no petite sizes available so i bought a size 2 which is a bit long, but that's ok. the arm holes weren't too small and the neckline is large enough to slip over my head. the dress is very much a swing dress...i wish there was just a little less dress...it really is too voluminous for my taste. i",1
"I bought this top thinking i would wear this and feel like i was part of some fashion week, but it's cut way too large that i felt like a football player. this top is made for women with small shoulders and a super petite frame. also, the cut is way too big. i was swimming in this.",0
"I ran to the store to try to this on after seeing it online. i'm usually between a small and medium on tops depending on the shirt; the 6 fit true to size. everything about this shirt fit perfectly and it is beautifully designed, but it is just soooo sheer. i had a nude bra on and you could see every detail of it through both the front and back. i couldn't wear this comfortably without a cami. disappointing as i had the highest hopes for finding a crisp white shirt for the summer!",0
This t-shirt is uniquely designed and it fit well. unfortunately within an hour it shed all over. i had white fuz all over my arms and pants. i was very disappointed.,0
"I am writing a review even though this is currently sold out (and was just released). what i love: the fit: snug, not too tight, and xs is true to size in the sense of historically. the wasit is cinched in, ample room in the chest. the fabric is substantial (thick and sturdy) and not prone to wrinkle, based on me having it in the bag in the hot car) and no false pleats was created. the sleeves are fun and different, may be a bit much for some. it is in multiple pieces, why it flutters so nicely.",1
The shirt is a little roomy but so flattering. the design with little see through holes across the shirt are unusual and make it unique.,1
"I purchased this top in a size s. it is lovely but way too wide. i am 5'8"" and 140 lbs. so it's unusual for me to have to size down to an xs. i am going to see if sizing down helps, but i am worried it will still be too wide. the fabric seemed of high quality and i loved the faded color so i am going to give it another chance.",1
"The shirt design is very nice, but it fits very loose. it will not look good if you are heavier as this shirt will make you look wider because of the baggy fit. the sleeves though are fitted and feel a little tight. the material of the sleeves also is very itchy and feels like some wool material.",0
I bought this top after seeing it featured on a style blog. i was really excited to wear it until i realized how see thru it was. i had to put a cami underneath which detracted from the beauty of the top. even my flesh toned bra showed thru so i sadly had to return it.,0
Super cute top! thin!! would look great layered! not crazy how it looked by itself!,1
"For the price of this tee the beautiful front lattice work should have been extended onto the back. would have been a classier, more finished looking garment. if the cost is not an issue then this tee makes a nice neutral addition to a neat but casual summer look.",1
"I was really excited for this jacket to arrive but it's going back. because the fabric is coated, it does not drape or hang nicely at all. i expected it to be boxy but it sticks out so oddly in every direction that it looks horrible. i'm usually an xs and ordered an xs and it looks ridiculous on me.",0
"Comfy, gauzy tee that has lovely lace detailing. the white is totally see through just fyi. i don't think it's the best quality but totally worth the sale price. i got the m and it's loose and flowy in a good way.",1
"The top is really cute, but it's see through and the material doesn't seem like the highest quality. definitely not worth the price.",0
"I purchased this shirt online. i thought it would be perfect for work, but when i tried it on, i couldn't even button half the buttons. it is also extremely see-through, and even a nude or white cami underneath would look really odd. need to return, unfortunately. if the top came in other colors, i would return for a larger size, but i can't deal with see-through work tops.",0
The embroidery across the top is quite lovely. the softness and light weighted fabric was ideal for the summer months. making this purchase on sale was such a bonus!,1
"This is a very pretty blouse and i like the mix of fabrics. i bought this in my usual size and it fit nicely except for the fact it is much too long. i have a short torso, and all this does it just cling and sit on my butt. perhaps this would work very nicely on someone that was athletic or tall and slender. sad to say, i had to return this because of the length.",1
"I'm a size xl, so my review might not apply to all people. i purchase my retailer tops in size xl and sometimes they fit great and sometimes they don't. when i put this top on it looked like i was wearing an open cardigan; nowhere near buttoning. i have some sewing experience, so i removed all 4 box pleats which gave me an additional 8 inches of fabric. after doing this i was able to easily button up the blouse and have it lay nicely. but i literally needed that extra 8 inches of fabric in the mid",1

Although the blouse is pretty it did not fit me well. i downsized two sizes and it still didn't hang well on my body. i think it looks great on the model and would probably look better on a thinner person. i am disappointed it did not work out and i will be returning it.,0
While these seem like interesting designs which i applaud!  the execution in the design of the fabric is not appealing.,0
"I purchased the grey in a medium, i normally wear an 8 or 10 in tops, 36 c.. i found it to fit quite well, but it has the shape that seems common at retailer lately in that it is shorter and more boxy. so if you have a longer torso(like me), you may not be the happiest. i loved the lace and didn't have an issue with that area being sheer, but the non-lace part is very thin. i did try it on with a black bra and it was obvious i was wearing black all around, you could even see the width of th",0

"Saw this top in store months ago but couldn't justify paying full price. when i saw it on sale i had to get it! it's flattering on both me and my mom, and we wear xs and l - good for a lot of body types since the fit is more loose. the top is more sheer than pictured, but it should be fine with a tank underneath. i plan on wearing it when going out with friends :)",1
Love the the pattern on these tops. i got the grey and got a ton of compliments on it. the fabric is a great weight for fall. it does fit on the larger side so i would definitely size down. i got the xs and wish xxs had been available.,1
As all the reviews say it is completely sheer. it's a very cute top other than that.,1

"Really love this sweater. i am pretty crushed i'm returning it. the flair below the waist is too much. the quality is wonderful, the color lovely, the style great- i wore it around the house and every time i caught a mirror, it just was too much material, too big a bell shape. oh well, still looking for the sweater for winter 2016/17.",0
"I tried on a returned 24p in my store, they were almost the right length, but the fit was more snug than pictured here (i have muscular thighs/butt, and 115 lbs). they were nice though, kind of a skinny pant. the carbon is a dark grey, can go with anything... only gripe is the waist height is low, at least on the behind... i would certainly show if i bend down without a long top.",1
"I read the cleaning instructions label carefully. followed them closely. and still, the dye ran and stained some of my colored clothes. pi**ed me off! just after the first wash and even before wearing them, i have streaks of uneven color on the pants. bad quality material or dye is what causes this. now i have to go and see if i can even get out my other stained clothes. thanks a lot retailer.",0
I love this sweatshirt! new favorite! it has a comfy meant to be oversized fit... love the little inspirational quote... and it's the kind of sweatshirt you want to live in! so stinking soft! got lots of compliments at the gym and the pick up line at school!!!,1

"I bought 2 pair of these in the store and ordered another color at the same time! these chinos are great for my figure. i like to think of myself as a ""diamond"" shape ;) large chest, moderate waist, large hips, and small legs. these pants fit so great!!! i bought my regular size and don't have to take in the legs! the fabric is nice with the additional stretch so we women who aren't 20 or 30-something any longer can still feel great and look good without being dumpy! i'm not a teeny woman either",1

"The perfect summer pants. i will be ordering more colors and possibly a smaller size. i think the slim fit would look just as good in a less slouchy size. i bought a size 31 petite in the dark blue (not navy) and they fit perfect and the color is amazing. very high quality, feel very soft and comfy. for reference, i'm curvy, 5'2"", 146 lbs, usual size is a 31 (10-12) but i've recently been losing weight so my sizing may be off. the pants do stretch out like most pilcro chinos.",1

"The neck is so big on this sweater, i couldn't make it lay right. the shape of the sweater is odd. it is really wide on the upper torso, but tapers near your waist. it did not look as depicted on the model. the sweater is a lovely color, i liked the two-tone, but overall the fit was too weird for me. material is soft and it felt really nice on, but just too oddly shaped and a crazy big neck.",0
This top is one of my retailer faves! it is so comfortable and love the quality and design. i receive many compliments on this top. i usually wear an xs or s in retailer tops and the xs was a little tight in the arms. the dressing room attendant suggested ordering a petite small so i wouldn't lose the shape. so glad i did. it fits perfect! i even ordered when it was on sale!! the gray color is perfect! its not too thick or thin.,0
"Love the blue color, different than many blue tops i own. i thought it was going to be a thicker knit and perhaps more stiff, but it is soft and a lighter knit and it makes the shape once on much more flattering.",1
I ove the interesting details on this pullover. it is super cozy on and i love the arched hem and extra long cuffs. the crew neck is wide and comfortable but not so wide that you need another shirt underneath. great easy pullover with jeans or leggings.,1
I really loved the color and fabric of this sweater. i liked everything about it except how wide it was at the bottom. i returned it for this reason.,0
This shirt is not near as nice as it may look the fabric is just ok it runs large i ordered a xs and the neck line was huge and gaping not worth the money even on sale,0
Great top that can be worn so many ways. i bought the top in gray because it is way more interesting in person. it has just a touch of sparkle in it and lots of texture. i have seen this top on several people and it seems to flatter lots of different body types.,1
"I so loved the look of this top and most of the reviews seemed really good. i thought the material was great and i ordered the blue which is a beautiful color....but......the fit was way off and the design is way off for a girl with hips. first the fit, the arm pits are low and don't actually tuck into where your armpits are, so you have this weird restriction in arm movement. then the design is not great either (and others mentioned this), the sweater at the bottom has way too much extra materi",0
"Love the blue color, and the bit of sparkle gives this otherwise casual piece a bit of flair. the hem is cool. love the big cuffs. but i looked like the liberty bell in the small. it is huge through the hips! not at all like on th model. i also worried it would shrink and i would lose the length in the arms. returned :(",0
"I bought this jumpsuit in a size medium (32d, 31 waist, 38 hips/butt). i have a jumpsuit in this style but it's silk so i was looking for one i could wear anytime. that said, even i need a heel with this jumpsuit. the problems were these: first, it was very hard to get on. very hard to tie the back, get all four panels even, tied, hiding my bra, etc. lots of fussing. your may need a partner to help. if i hadn't been doing a lot of yoga, i may not have managed. once on, the style looked great. as",1
"High quality, and worth full price.... but way too small. also a bit short in the torso.",1
"This top does look as pictured, the sleeves hit me the same and the size was true... i just didn't like it... it was shorter than i wanted in length and i just didn't feel like this top was worth the price so it's going back. i feel like i have had shirts with this texture and over time, they just didn't wear as well so i was afraid with 3 kids it wouldn't be a good idea. i paired it with a blazer and it looked great, but on it's on, i don't know, just not for me. for reference, i am 5'8'' 128lb",0
"I so badly wanted this top to work. it looks so cute! but, as soon as i tried it on, i knew it wasn't a keeper. i didn't even need a mirror! it's not suited for those of us with a bust (i'm a 34d) and anything but a lanky model-esque frame. i suggest sizing up if you're busty and want to give it a try. it looked dowdy on me.",0
"I am on the fence about this one. the length is great. it hits right above my knee at 5'1. overall it was larger than i was hoping. the waist is pretty loose, and i really had to tightly tie the back to get s good shoulder fit. the bottom is very voluminous making me look wide. i wish they had it in a petite size. for this price, i will probably return it. it's not worth the 300 price tag.",0
"This dress looked like something i would wear and covet for years. unfortunately it was loose in the places where it should show shape and was tight in others. the bodice is incredibly small and not meant for bigger chested women. while the fabric is beautiful, overall the dress did not look like much. disappointed.",0
Not a tunic unless the model pictured is 5'1. barely covered my backside and not as advertised. design on top is interesting and the fabric is soft so it's a good buy if 50% off or more.,0
One of the sales women was wearing this today. she looked amazing. then i tried on. i looked really great. the gray pattern is much more distinctive in person. it is comfy - 97% cotton. the unique hem adds punch. able to dress up or down. i'm a true size 6. small fits perfectly. medium was very loose and oversized. well constructed. feels more like a $98 ($78 retail) pullover. highly recommend.,1
I was interested in this sweater because i actually thought it was a tunic. the sweater is much shorter than i thought. i wish i could return it. i bought a size large which is my normal size.,0
My sister gave me this top for christmas and it's perfect. i find myself grabbing for it constantly. i'm usually an xsp and the xxs fits me perfectly. i wear it with leggings and jeans.,1
Beautiful choice...beautiful fit for my daughter's slim body,1
"I didn't thoroughly read the description of this product, so when it arrived i was surprised to see the thread was sparkly. i tried it on and the neckline is absolutely beautiful and feminine. it looks like a masculine cut on the model, but it's actually a really beautiful neckline with flared flowing bottom to it.

my only complaint is that it looks a tad longer on the model then it is is real life. i'm 5'9"" and it shows most of my behind, unlike the length of the model where it seems more like",1
Really well made. beautiful. sadly it is very short. not a tunic at all.,0
"Purchased this sweater as a gift for my daughter and when i saw it wanted one for myself. it is a light to medium weight and works well with jeans or for work. the sweater is shaped smaller at bottom and is flattering. the one problem was that when you raise your arms, the sweater also rises to expose your torso. it was returned.",1
"This dress was my absolute favorite recent retailer purchase. the fit is so flattering. i think this dress runs true to size-i usually wear a size 6 in hd in paris, and that's what size i ordered. i expect i could have fit in a 4 but the 6 is comfortable. i am 5'4'' but i ordered the regular length and it hit just above the knee. i agree that it could use pockets but no need for lining. however-- i just laundered this dress for the first time-hand wash, lay flat to dry (as recommended) and this dr",0
Comfortable and flattering for all body types...good for both day and evening...,1
This is a great throw on and go dress. it would work great with a sweater and tights or by itself in the hottest of weather. it looks a lot less awkward on than the picture online indicates.,1
I love the idea but it is more of a over sweater than to wear by itself like model... too big/baggy,1
"Finally received this in the mail today and was very disappointed. i am swimming in the xs (5'4"", 110lbs). the colors are much more vibrant that shown in the pics - the green is a bright kelly green, the red is much more red than rust colored, etc. and it's a sweater coat! for the price i was expecting it to be lined and higher quality. i don't doubt that it will be warm, but can't justify the price. it's going back to the store.",0
"Dress is cute and comfortable to wear. i bought the black motif in regular size 0. it fits perfectly and falls just above my knees. i have washed it in the washing machine placed in a large zippered mesh bag and hung it to dry. as mentioned in previous reviews, with the exception of it being unlined, it's a wonderful dress and am so happy to have it.",1
"Ordered online, and when it came i was very excited to open it - but the photo doesn't show how incredibly wide the cut is. it is also quite cropped and looked very awkward on me - 5'9, 130. the embroidery is lovely, but the style doesn't work. i had a small, but the area in the shoulders was cut very tight and it would not have worked well if i wanted to raise or lower my arms above shoulder height. might work better on someone with a more petite frame, but i do caution how ""voluminous"" the cut",0
"I'm glad that i went with the other reviewers and sized down on this one. i bought this in a medium (usually wear a 10/12) and it fit perfectly. the colors and pattern are beautiful and will definitely look great with dark jeans/pants/shorts. the lace detail is just gorgeous! the bottom flows more loosely, but just enough to cover any midsection flaws and pairs nicely with dark skinny jeans.",1
"I am 5'9 135lbs, small chest and narrow shoulders. the 6 fits me perfectly. i love the fact that there is a hem, if i decide to let it down just a little. being over 60 and tall, it is so disappointing to find a dress you love but is just a little too short. the fabric is not too heavy for our moderate summers and i think i will wear this often.",1
"I was so sad not to love this dress. it is beautiful, but is so unflattering on. there is a lot of material under the arms and it gathers up due to the smocking. so, it just made me look incredibly frumpy. i don't really think a petite would have helped - the gathers just bunch a bit and so rather than hang, the dress sort of clumps. i am lean but broad shouldered and maybe that is the problem, but i was super disappointed. narrow shouldered people with long torsos could pull this off. it is a t",0
"When i opened the package i knew i was in love. the colors are vibrant-true to the photo. the fabric is delicious, soft and silky, the perfect weight for a warm summer day. these can be dressed up or down. i am 5'9"" 140lbs. i bought the medium and they fit with plenty of room.

i would highly reccomend these shorts-just gorgeous! come on summer!",1
This shirt is wonderful! i totally recommend it for everyone.,1
"I liked this dress, but had some issues. i am 5' 3"" and a 34 d. with small shoulders. the dress was way too big in the shoulders in the 6 i usually wear, so just hung on me funny. otherwise i really liked it. if it weren't for the way it fit me on top (not an unusual problem if you are large busted but have small shoulders) meant i had to return it.",1
This fits like a dream! the almost three quarter length sleeves are perfection. worth every penny!,1
"I actually like the fit - but i guess it depends on your overall body type. i too ordered a small and medium. i actually could fit the small, but preferred the room in the medium. the movement on these are spectacular and the material is light and cool.",1
I didn't look close enough when i ordered and failed to see that this was a peplum top.  it did not do my post-pregnancy body any favors.  but the collar area detail is quite nice and this would look great on the right body.,1
"These pants looked worn, washed & old looking when i received them! the quality is super thin cotton as if it's been washed a million times & is about to fall apart! the workmanship is terrible. you can see loose stitching all over. the top portion is too tight & looks terrible stretched out. i liked absolutely nothing about this pants except the idea of them from the picture online...",0
The wash on these jeans made my hips look twice as big. that in combination with the looser boyfriend cut was not flattering. quality was excellent. denim was thick with the right amount of stretch. unfortunately they had to go back.,0
"This shirt fits well, is flattering, and has a really pretty pattern to it. the lace adds a romantic touch that sets it apart. it's also incredibly soft and comfortable.",1
Very flattering to a woman's figure. can dress up or down.,1
"I can't say enough about this top! absolutely adorable, the pics don't do it justice. it is made of a soft, medium weight jersey material. the lace makes the top more dressey and unique. the drop waiste elongatesy our torso and is loose pleated at the bottom for interest. i am 5'6'', 135 pounds, and long waisted. this fits me perfect (sz small.) the pleated bottom on me begins at low hips (below belly button) so it layes nice and is very flattering. no swing to the top,no bulky extra flare at al",1
"Love this dress and have bought the style in three color/pattern variations. fits comfortably, looks polished yet effortless. appreciate that the sleeves come closer to the elbow, gives it a vintage vibe.",1
"I liked the concept of this vest, but when i tried it on, i felt like i was 9 years old again and wearing my brownies girl scout uniform. it was also very boxy and wide. it seemed to be well-made, though, and maybe would have worked if it were a different color.",0
"After eyeing this product online for awhile, i was able to try it on in store. i'm so glad i did, because while this dress is lovely, it is clearly not designed for my body type. i have a small rib cage and a large bust (32h,) which is i think what caused the keyhole to be so gaping on me. additionally, the straps of the dress were up by my neckline instead of lying properly on my shoulders, which was unflattering and left my bra straps clearly visible. the fabric was gorgeous and soft, and the",0
"This tank is very loose fitting, which i can understand would make some think it runs large. taking into account the fabric and the twisted straps, i personally think it would look ridiculous if it was more fitted. i love the draped styling, which i also think makes sense with the pattern. it's an easy top too...just throw on and go. and the loose fit is perfect for the disgustingly hot and humid summer months here in the midwest.",1
Very nice and the sleeve have a great design and the length is finally long enough,1
"This dress fits so well, it is extremely well cut and flattering. the length is perfect (i am 5'5).  i passed on it though, because i didn't love the color. almost like a navy blue that has been washed one too many times. if this dress had more color options or made in a cute print i would not hesitate to buy it. if blue is your color go for it.",1
"This is a great sweater. great color and style. i love that it's a little retro. can be worn with jeans and tights. highly recommend. it does run a little big, but not by a lot.",1
"I have been looking for a nice, white tunic and i should have known when i saw this was one size fits all. maybe because i am petite (5'2"") but there was so much material hanging everywhere that it made me look even shorter and fat. who wants that? so sending it back.",0
This blouse is very unique due to the pretty piped design on the back. looks great with jeans. the front is shorter and more tailored than the back. i love this blouse!,1
"This tank is pretty. it looks nice and is not cut too low. the bottom is ""flowy"" and not extremely fitted. i always get a lot of compliments when i wear it.",1
"Fell in love with the look of this top in the store but they didn't have it in my size (0) -- thought i'd try the 2 as the 0 was sold out online as well. alas, the fit is rather tentlike -- it did not drape as i had hoped. a beautiful and unique pattern on the right body, but on my slight frame it was not flattering. it's going back to retailer.",0
"The flower print really caught my eye. i like the unique twisted neckline. there is a lot of material here, but it hangs nicely without billowing out like some other unfortunate tops.",1
I'm not sure why this dress is getting great reviews. the plunging neckline is ridiculous and ran down to the underwire of my bra and the slit up the side came up to the upper part of my thigh. it was one of the worst fitting/cut dresses i've every tried on at retailer. i'm 5'4 125. maybe you have to be 6 feet tall and 90 pounds for this dress to not look like a bad renaissance faire costume.,0
I have worn this dress twice and it is amazing. the material feels heavy and drapey but i still feel nice and cool in it. i always have several people asking me where i bought it when i wear it. i am 5'1 130 lbs and 34 d. i bought a small petite and it fit perfectly. i love this dress and would highly recommend it to anyone. definitely one of the best things i've ever bought from retailer.,1
I was looking for long vest to go with skinny jeans. this is exactly what i was looking for. the color is better than the pic to me. the style is flattering.. the size is just right. can't wait to wear it. i strongly recommend it.,1
"I bought the tiny brand ""cassia"" tank last week in a small, and it fits beautifully. i ordered this ""sorcha"" tank in a small as well and it is huge! i am very sad about the huge size difference. look closely at the photos... the fabric twists as it goes over the shoulders to the back....it is quite bulky. hard to tell if that would minimize in a smaller size. my store doesn't carry this item so i can't easily try another.",0
"My husband bought it for me and i was a bit skeptical at first. tried it on and absolutely loved it. besides the really soft fabric, it has pockets which makes it even more comfortable for me! i'm 5'8"", 123lbs. and flat chested. he got me a medium, which fits a bit tight, but my husband likes it so it's a keeper!",1
"Great length if over 5'5"". ran at least 1-2 sizes smaller. great wash",1
I was surprised i was the 1st to review this t- i got it on black friday & loved the fit and look immediately! i wear w skinny jeans and boots but also converse or ... many options and a good price!,1
"I'm normally a size 25p. i bought these in a 26 because i wanted a more relaxed fit. i could barely pull them up over my calves. i could get them on and button them, but i felt like a sausage stuffed into a straw. size up 2 sizes at least!",0
Such an amazing shirt to dress down for a long day at school,1
"I purchased this sweater in my usual xs, but found the silhouette to be way more tent-like than pictured on the model. the knit is pretty stiff, too, so the sweater didn't lay flat but hung on me in kind of a triangle shape. also, the sweater knit was heavier than i expected from the picture and seemed to be more of a fall weight piece. i am fairly small, but lately i'm finding that retailer pieces are huge in an xs and i have to size down to xxs. i know i'm not that tiny ... maybe this wou",0
"I always go w/ black, but deviated this time & so glad i did! quality fabric, not sheer at all. a great layering piece and new staple for the wardrobe. fits tts, sm (i'm 5'2"", 109lbs)",1
Great fit and very cute design. goes great with jeans.,1
"Love this dark gray heathered blazer ( no stripes, contrary to its name)! very easy to wear with the bit of spandex, and not hot or heavy like my tailored wool blazers. i am usually a petite medium but decided to order petite large to better accomodate layers or sweaters, sleeve length perfect even with sweater on. will get lots of wear with this dress-up or dress-down piece!",1
"I tried on the grey motif yesterday, and it was the one thing i tried on that i loved, and the only thing i bought. i'm 5'4 34 dd 125 lbs, and the xs was a perfect fit for me. i sometimes find that retailer stuff is tight in the arms, so i generally wear a small, but i tried on the small, and the arms were a bit baggy. i plan on wearing tanks underneath, so the xs was the right call. if you want to wear something thicker & long sleeved underneath, go with your usual size.",1
"Ok, if i had a different body, this would be awesome but i have a big butt and meaty thighs so just did not flatter me. although my husband couldn't tell that the pants were tugging on me (thanks to the pattern it does camouflage), it was uncomfortable. so if you are built like me, this isn't the jumpsuit for you. 

this is a well made garment but there is no give in the butt and thigh area (hence would not recommend for my thick thighed sisters). 

for reference, i am 5'3 and 150 pounds. th",0
"I bought the grey t with the design around the yoke. it's cute, but the fabric is a little on the thin side. kind of cheap. i'm glad i didn't pay full price for it. runs true to size.",1
"Nicely structured, yet soft blazer. wardrobe staple. runs true to size. i would buy all colors, but restrained myself to the black/green.",1
"Unfortunately this piece has a very boxy cut and the white layer is stiff and billows out - i am tall and thin but this made me look pregnant - very unflattering. i considered trying a smaller size, but i did not like the material too much either so i just returned it.",0
"I bought the blue dress, though the ""blue"" dress was a little more like grey according to my husband and i. the quality of the fabric was quite nice.

i have to return the dress because it does not fit me around the bust. i consider myself to have a good size bust (not huge), but the dress seems to expect quite a bit smaller. 

i was initially attracted to the dress because it looked a little more casual, which is what i wanted, but i guess i just wouldn't call it at all pretty.",1
"This is definitely a personal preference review. i loved this dress when i tried it on. it's really beautiful. however, there was just way too much fabric on the sleeves for me. i know it's the style and i have similar style dresses, but i felt really large in this dress and it all came down to the sleeves for me.",0
"In the photo, this sweater is very appealing but in person very disappointing. i am 5'7, always take a size medium but on me, the sleeves were far too long and the sweater just didn't fit properly. the collar doesn't fold right in the front and it hangs awkwardly. if you try to use the button, it stretches and looks terrible. in the back, it falls short. it's going back.",0
"This dress is slightly tight on me and i usually wear petite 00 or xxs (5'1 100 lbs) the quality of the fabric is thick and texture, colors are just like the photo, and it has a nice satin like underlining in a dark navy. the snug fit of the dress makes it so i don't need a bra, which is nice especially for a day dress !",1
"Quality is great, fit is great, and the message keeps me in a good mood and motivated throughout the day :)

i got it in a size 2 (i am usually a s-m in retailer tops) and it fits great (for reference 5'4"" 140lbs, 37-29-39).

i usually don't wear grey but the bright colored font led me to make an exception.

very happy with the purchase!",1
"I ordered this dress and have sent it back. i think it could be a flattering dress; the waist hit quite a bit above my natural waist which made the entire thing fit weirdly. i am very long waisted, so this might just be a problem for me. i ordered regular size 2.",0
"I love this dress but the zipper is definitely defective.
its a flatering style and i love the fabric and fit. im normally a 10 but the 8 fit perfectly. 

i'm nervous to wear it because of the zipper. i would return it but dont have the receipt.",0
I received this in the mail and it looked beautiful but the zipper was broken just like one of the other reviews. normally i would just exchange but i don't know if it's worth getting another broken one.,0
This dress overwhelmed me. i'm 5 feet tall and the print and material just took over.,0
"I received this as a gift and have seldom been so pleased with anything. as another reviewer noted, some retailer clothing looks darling and then falls apart. not something acceptable at this price point.

unlike her, this was not one of those times. i've worn this daily, for weeks and feel like the buttons, trim and weave could not be any better. not only that but it looks terrific with everything. the sweater has a flattering line that tapers at the waist even unbuttoned. it is soft, warm and cl",1
"The picture of this dress does not do the colors justice. they are a very rich green and pink, which were a popular color combination in the 70's. (i was there!) it adds an authentic touch to this great peasant dress. the black and white embroidery on the bib gives it a modern flair. i am 5'6"", 130 pounds, and usually wear a size six in a dress. the small fit perfect. while the dress is billowy, the square on the back pulls it in, so it doesn't fit like a tent. perfect for boots now, sandals lat",1
Beautiful dress! the pics online do not do any justice! i got compliments all day!,1
"I ordered this and thought it would be cute for work, but it tuns out the sleeves are ridiculously long. i am 5 foot 10 and do not have short arms. also it is a bit short waisted for me. i do love the floral detail of the button.",0
Usually red tops which are a true red are hard to find. this is more red in person that in the photo. great feel to material and the drape is wonderful. sometimes peplum tops can make me look bigger than i am (5'6 and 138 lbs) but this one has a nice slimming effect and the v-neck is complimentary to a smaller bust 36b. love it !!!!!!!,1
"In the picture it looked to be a structured blazer, but when i tired it on (i got an extra small) and it was too big.",0
This was all wrong on me. the puffy sleeves made me look a foot wider. i'm thinking this will look good on tall slim ladies. it is extremely comfortable and the material is very pretty though. tts,1

"I was disappointed with this dress because it is not the usual retailer quality. the quality of the material is not very good. i've bought boiled wood jackets from this brand before and they're very soft and very well made, hence my disappointment. i agree with the other reviewers in that this dress runs very large and the length is short for a winter dress.",0
"This dress runs very large. i am 5'4 and 120 lbs, hourglass, curvy build. i ordered a size small and its enormous on me. the description says fitted but it is not fitted at all. it's like a big wool sack. i'd have to gain 30 lbs for this dress to come close to fitting. i'm very sad that the fit is so far off and the dress is now all sold out in all smaller sizes, including petite.

"I love this top!! in fact if it came in more colors, i'd buy a few more. it's just so soft and comfortable, wear it now in cooler weather with layers or later in spring and even cooler summer nights. the neckline is perfect, love the subtle details. it fits perfect in my usual size medium and is a good length to wear either with jeans or long enough for leggings with a cami peaking out beneath. yes, i love it, just wish there were more colors.",1
"This is a very cute and warm dress. it is flattering, yet appropriate for work. but i had to send it back for two reasons. the zipper didn't work well. it just wouldn't zip without someone helping me and even then it was very difficult to zip. perhaps it was just the zipper on my dress?

the neck felt like it was strangling me was the other reason i sent it back. if i am not comfortable i will not end up wearing it, so even though i loved the style of it the pragmatics were lacking.",0

i found that colors are not as bright as pictured, overall color looks beige in real life. fabric has nice weight, not too heavy nor too light, it is not itchy, but not very soft either. good dress for colder weather. the sizing was right, i got my usual m and i am 5'10'' 145lb. the dress has a side zipper, but i did not need it. the dress is slimming and close to the body. the cut did not work for me: sleeves were too short, i had to pull them up t",0

it runs quite large, in my opinion. i'm 5'7"" and about 130-135lbs. the small was huge on me in the chest and shoulders/arms. the stomach also wasn't very fitted. the material is thinner than i expected (you can see through the dress to some extent when you hold it up to the light), but i don't think this is a problem, necessarily. had it been thicker, it probably would be too warm. but you might need a slip",0
"I took a chance on this top because i liked the style. i prefer natural fibers like cotton and linen. this is rayon and spandex. sure, why not at least give it a shot and go outside my box?! if the fabric would have been my preference, it would have been a keeper. i did not like the feel, nor the semi-sheer quality. maybe it would work for you, but not for me. back it went.",0
"I bought this dress in an xs, and am 5'4"", 115 lbs, and fairly proportional. the shoulders were snug, but the hips (and maybe waist)were at least 2-3x too big. comically so-- the fabric stood away from my body like wings on each side.",0
"This shirt is beautiful and so soft. it would have made a wonderful long-sleeved tee except for the fact that it was so low cut. the only way this is wearable is with a tank underneath which, for me, defeats the purpose of this type of shirt. i am rather busty (34 dd), so maybe if you are smaller on top you might could pull it off.",0
I would really like this dress if the material were a little thicker. it's really thin so you can see my nipples straight through the dress. you can't wear a bra with it because it is backless so i don't understand how you are supposed to wear this outside of the house.,0
"Recently received this and was very disappointed with the quality. the fabric was very thin, easily stretched out of shape. price is ridiculous for this item!",0
"I was so disappointed with the quality of this dress, especially because it looks so beautiful on the model. the fabric was so thin that after one hand wash, it's already developing a tiny hole and pilling. also, it is definitely not a ""day dress""--i wore it as a swim coverup, but it is much too thin and pajama-like to be worn as an actual dress. the color is much different in person--the blue is brighter and, for lack of a better way to describe it, cheap looking. the white banding around the t",0
"Definitely pj quality. i have a fairly thin frame and this hung on me like a tent. and it's very thin, so it works as a swim cover, but definitely not a dress for anything else.",0
"I added this to my cart on a whim, and what a nice surprise! the color is gorgeous--this dark plum color is a great alternative to grey, black, or brown. i'm planning to wear it first with a cream sweater, a mustard colored scarf, and a brown leather jacket. i am a pear-shape, and this skirt works very well to structure (and minimize!) my bottom half. it also isn't as short as i thought it might be--although i, like the previous reviewer, plan to wear this with tights and boots. the only negativ",1
"Love this top - it is a beautiful shade of blue and the buttons at the bottom add a nice touch. it is light weight and not too long or wide. i have other t.la tops in small, but the xsm worked better for me with this top.",1
"Although the fabric and color is beautiful,  the sleeves do not lay properly. they are too stiff and look like wings on me. sadly i must return. the quality looks great. it is unfortunate that the design was a miss.",0
"This top is gorgeous: beautiful lace, substantial fabric, great color. but it looked so weird on me. i have broader shoulders, and the sleeves did not drape on me like they do on the model, they just stuck straight out. as another reviewer mentioned, the fabric is stiff. i didn't want to size up because the body and length both fit well. perhaps if you have smaller/ rounded shoulders this top will hang better. for reference i'm 5'4"", 120 lbs, and tried a size s.",1
"I saw this top online and ordered immediately!
i loved the color, lace, and unique details.
sadly it just arrived and it is a disaster!
the lace is stiff and doesn't lay softly, and is very rough against your skin.
the style ( and i like shorter style tops) is extremely boxy and the sleeves protrude outwards in a funny way.,.....
that although i am so in love with this color, i would be embarrassed to wear this top in public.
it could have been fantastic, if the lace was softer, and some a",0
"I absolutely love these shorts! they are the perfect length, too. i have been looking for shorts this length and rise height for years. it's hard to find shorts that aren't super short yet aren't bermuda and are still flattering. i especially recommend these for those that miss wearing shorts because of insecurities with their thighs/mid-section.

rolls are not sewn on both ends, so you'll have to re-roll each wash.

wish you carried these basics at all times.",1
The color of this top is amazing--much more vibrant than in the photo and the fit is perfect. it is very flirty and pretty and the detailing around the top is gorgeous. it's pricey but i splurged and am glad i did. it looks adorable with a corduroy skirt and boots for the fall.,1
T.la got it right this time. love the fabric. the color is perfect for summer and the color is a great shade of green. exactly as pictured. the left side has a slight cut with silver buttons. exactly as it looks on line. i certainly recommend this top. love it.,1
My new favorite socks! has a grip and doesn't slip off like some of my other liner socks have because this one covers more of your feet. perfect for my low boots.,1
Cute denim shorts that roll up or down. perfect with everything.,1
"I have 7 pair of pilcro denim shorts from retailer and for some reason the colored ones (white, yellow, pink) hold their shape but the denim blue completely stretch out. i went down a size in these and they still stretch to the point of sagging. i really want the black ones...hoping they don't do it too.",1
"This is an adorable basic & i should have been wearing it once a week this summer, but instead the fabric developed noticeable holes after the very first wear. this brand makes some of the softest, cutest tees, but unfortunately more often than not are unwearable after the first or second wash. i wash on gentle & hang dry. not worth the cost.",0
"I love the cut and ""swing"" of this tee. the royal blue is very saturated and pretty.",1
"I'm 5'9"" and 155lb. i have been wearing small a but this was realllllly small especially at my arms. it made me look like i was taking off... much more beautiful on the model. a medium would e been too big on my torso. the color is amazing! made my blonde hair really pop. i don't love green but this was so different.  would love to find something else in this color that suits me! you need to be a super skinny waif to look good in this!",1
"This brand always makes the softest tees, and so i buy several each season. when i saw this one online, i worried that it might be too long for my short waist, but i decided to order it anyway. success! i ordered my usual size m (for knit tops - 10/12 in fitted ones), and the length was perfect due to the buttons on the side.
fyi: short waist, broad shoulders/back, 36c - i carry my weight in the middle, since i virtually do not have a waistline. so a longer, boxy tee will emphasize the parts of",1
"I don't know how to explain, but this dress at least for me did not look like the model, first off the dress is extremely heavy and extremely long and then where the fur starts, for me it didn't start at the right spot so it was very awkward looking... so definitely not for my type of body, i am normal height (5'5'', athletic and curvy body) but maybe for a very tall person looks good! the material is very interesting, it's so soft!",0
"Saw this online and went in to try on. fit great and is true to size, but i should have known there would be issues as three out of six on the rack had the sewn in tags were all but hanging by a thread. i bought this for my bachelorette weekend in napa and when i put this on i noticed the straps had a few threads coming out and i thought, better get this to the seamstress as soon as i get home to secure the straps. well, literally five minutes into the car ride to the wineries i noticed the seam",0
"Giving 3.5 stars due to how big this dress runs. i am 5' 118lbs and i was swimming in the xs. it is a beautiful dress, just beware it runs very large.",0
"I got this tunic in the bright red, and it is a great, fun color that leans just slightly to the orange side of red. (my computer screen makes it look more orange than it does in person. i'm happier with the actual color.) the fabric is soft, comfortable and hangs beautifully. wrinkles fall out when you hang it up. i also have the tegan tunic in 2 colors and find the fit to be the same. however, the hi-low hem on this dress is a little more exaggerated than on the tegan. the tegan travels very w",1
"Runs very large and way too much fabric. i wanted this top to work because it looks cute on hanger. i usually wear s/m and the xs had too much fabric. may work better on someone with longer torso and taller. i am 5'6.5"" 36c 126lbs",0
"I love this dress! the fabric feels amazing & is super flattering. i am 5'4 with broad shoulders & a 36d chest and went with the small petite. i originally purchased the regular extra small which looked great, i just think the sp was slightly neater though the shoulders & length. it hits me above the knee as shown in the photo of the light colored dress with the long vest",1
"I ordered the taupe version of this tee, which was a medium brown with black stripes. the fabric felt itchy and rough, and was pretty sheer for not being light colored. i didn't care for the fit, which was extremely boxy and wide; from the picture, i expected an a-line fit, but not a wide drop with webbed underarms. i ordered 2 sizes, and could have worn the smaller if i'd kept this tee. it runs on the larger side. what astounded me most was that both tees i ordered were sewn with completely cro",0
This dress is so pretty in the photos but in person it's huge. and not in a way i could adjust by sizing down. the shoulders and arms fit but the body of the dress is absolutely huge. i normally love a trapeze dress but i was swimming in this so it was quite unflattering. it was also much longer than it looks on the model. i'm not short - in fact dresses are normally a bit shorter on me than the average person but this was just frumpy.,0
"This seems to be designed to fit a bit loose, but not in a bad way (for me). the floral pattern on the collar with the polka dots on the rest of the dress are very cute, and i think this can look good with or without a belt. light for summer but still covers a lot, which is nice for the office. the sleeves are a little short, but it doesn't look bad. glad i snatched it.",1
"Really happy with this tunic. at 5'2 i am able to wear this as a dress or a top (with a belt). it's comfy, light material, and can be dressed up or down.",1
I bought the shirt in ivory and went down a size per the advice from other reviewers. what i should have done was go down 2 sizes! runs huge! my husband said i looked pregnant and that's never a good look if your not. sent this back the same day.,0
"I also have this dress in 3/4 sleeve, tegan tunic. i love this dress. it can be dressed up or down.",0
"I ordered the ivory in size xl. it is such a cute, comfortable top. all of the details are well-done. the quality of the material is great too. it's a flowy fit. after washing & air-drying, it does shrink a bit. great tee for summer!",1
"In that i'm on the busty-side, i thought, ""surely an xl will not be too large."" ah contraire. wanted it in crimson anyway, so will try it in a large. the fabric in the white is nice in that it is substantial enough not to see-through. will look most interesting under a sweater or jacket.",1
"Wanted to love this dress - pretty fabric and colors. i think it would be more flattering on a taller woman (i'm 5'3"", ordered a s), this just looked like a nightgown on me. sorry to say it's going back.",0
"I really want to like this dress - it's beautiful, but it just fits like a sack. the yoke exaggerates my bust and the dress makes me look 20 lbs heavier. perhaps if you are tall and thin like the mode, or small chested, it would be great! the quality and color is beautiful.",0
"Got this top in white and the rust color. other reviewers mentioned it being much too large, so i went with the xs instead of my usual small. it's slightly oversized, but i love that look, and it's still flattering on me. i also didn't find there to be too much fabric. i am very tall and am happy with the length of this. 34b, 126 lbs, 5'10""",1
"I absolutely love everything about this top! i bought it in the taupe/navy stripes version and got compliments the first time i wore it. i do not find the fabric to be sheer at all, but perfectly lightweight for the heat of summer. the neckline and sleeves seem tailor-fitted for my body. i don't often think much about sleeves but these sleeves are the perfect length/shape to be incredibly flattering. they're in a sweet spot somewhere in between a cap sleeve and regular-length. the neckline is eq",1
"This dress is gorgeous. i purchased it recently to wear to my civil wedding ceremony and it is absolutely perfect. it is light, flowy, and comfortable, but the details make it special. the sheer sleeves give it ethereal vibe that i love. the quality seems to be extremely high as well. if you are looking for a white dress that is casual, but still unique and beautiful, please give this one a shot. i cannot wait to wear it on my special day!",1
"The fabric of this top is lovely. the fit not so. it does not fit as shown on the model. the fit is very large around the middle and fits more like a ""swing"" top. i am 5'9"" slim build. i ordered my usual size medium. shoulders and back fit perfectly. too much material around the middle. had it had a straight cut to it, as shown, i'd keep it. because it doesn't it's going back.",0
"I own another dolan dress which is virtually the same as this but has long sleeves. i wear the long-sleeved one whenever i give presentations or readings. the material is absolutely genius for travel. just unpack, shake it out and you're good to go.
i love the sleeves on this short-sleeved version. i'm fairly fit but at my age i'm not excited about showing off my arms! the drape is beautiful and i can wear high heels, bootees or flats with it. i bought the red. sometimes you can't tell if the c",1
"Thylo strikes again! this dress was magic the second i put it on - flowy, polka-dot magic! this baby can transform itself as you go from a casual day out to an dressy evening, with plenty of customizable options in between. to dress down, it looks great with a denim jacket, then take the jacket off and you are ready for some dressed up fun. you can pair it with tall boots or short, sandals, pumps, you name it. the ties at the neck look great undone, loosely tied, or done in a bow. leggings or ti",1
"Wow. this didn't work for me. loved the red color and drape and subtle shine of the fabric. but it fit like a sack. and you could see deeply into the armpits from the side revealing my bra and more. way too long. i looked silly. maybe it was the size. i'm 5'3"" and ordered the large. this was my first retailer dress order but i'm not giving up. maybe the petite would have been a better fit. don't think i'll try again with this one, however.",0
This is a very cute designed shirt but it fits very boxy and runs large,1
I ordered my usual size and i think the length and the top (chest/arms) for great. however the bottom is more of a swing style than a straight or slight a-line as depicted in the stock photo. there is too much fabric in the stomach area and just not flattering.,0
"This dress is beautiful, but not made for someone with a 36d. i ordered a 12 and i could get my chest in this dress. i really wish it fit. it's well made and very beautiful. belt does not come with the dress.",0
"I tried this product in store in red and fell in love with the fit, it fits in the most beautiful flattering way, red looked gorgeous - rich glossy fabric, this could easily be one of those effortless summer transition pieces that can go from a day dress into incredible sexy night outfit. the fabric was very lush and had this rich gloss to it, i have never seen a fabric like that, it almost looked coated. red being such a statement piece was a bit too much for me, so i decided to order the produ",1
Love this kimono. design is bohemian and it will be a great layering piece. can be belted over simple black dress or layered with jeans and boots. almost didn't purchase because of the reviews concerned with fragile material but i didn't find that to be an issue once i felt the garment. great piece for fall.,1
"I purchased this dress for a baby shower and it was just perfect. i am 5'3"" and 110 pounds and ordered the petite xs which fit great. the dress is supposed to be a tad oversized and flowy so this size worked out great for me! it will also be a nice transition piece into spring with a pair of black fringe booties :) overall, i recommend this dress!!",1
"This is the perfect little throw-on dress. flattering, uber-comfortable, nice fabric. i found that it runs slightly large.",1
"This dress is so pretty in person. the colors are great - the blue and green and just beautiful in person. the fit is tts. i happen to have a blue belt and could style it just as the model has, but really it doesn't need it. it is super flattering even without a belt. i am just a hair shy of 5'5"", and i cannot wear flats or it would drag the floor. but adding a 2 1/2"" wedge is perfect to keep it off the floor (no hemming needed). i don't usually pay full price, but i am glad i did in this case.",1
"I tried this on in a medium in the store and it was too big overall. i thought it was a nice concept for a feminine, whimsical top so i ordered a small online. but even then a small is still too big (and i usually wear a medium or an 8 in tops). maybe if it was slimmer through the ribs/waist area it could work but it just ends up looking maternity-ish and too voluminous everywhere below the bust. the front was too short, as well (stopped higher than what is shown on the model and i'm assuming sh",0

"I loved this romper so much! the material is thin, but perfect for summer. the style is just what i was looking for. it's so so cute and fit perfectly...at first. i wore it one time and then washed it exactly as described on the tag and it shrunk beyond recognition. it went from loose and flowy, like on the model, to little booty shorts and a body suit...not the look i was going for. i am so disappointed.",0
"This was a bit of a disappointment. the colors are beautiful, but the shape was not flattering on my petite frame. it is somewhat wide and boxy in the shoulders and body. the fabric is stiffer that i expected, and therefore it doesn't drape nicely on the shoulders and through the torso. if you look closely at the model, you can see what i am talking about at the shoulder. the shoulders stick out a tad, and the gathering at the neck contributes to the larger, boxy look. this might look nice on th",0
This dress was just perfect. the fit was just right and it is made well. love the ruffles... could definitely be dressed up or wore casual. great dress all around ... a keeper!!!,1
"After reading the other reviews, i took a chance and ordered the peach one and the blue (red?) one in large. i am usually at the top end of xl's, but i've noticed that holding horses items tend to run a bit bigger. i hit the jackpot with this one. yes, it's a little ""boxy"". all the better to hide what i want to hide. the length is perfect for me and the gathers at the shoulders give enough room across the chest so that it doesn't pull at the buttons. the peach one came today, and i was a bit sur",1

pros:
- flattering fit and flow. hides lumps and bumps.
- cut at the neck and back is cute and didn't make me look chunky surprisingly.
- little red polka dots aren't overwhelmingly at all and add a nice retro feel.
- good overall length.
- usa made!

This romper checks off all the boxes! it's beautiful and the fit is perfect!,1
"I was really lucky to pick up these shorts during the tag sale, and they are great! lightweight, roomy in the legs (way more my speed, i prefer shorts that don't cling) and really soft. they also weren't too short. i am usually between two sizes at retailer, depending on the brand, and ended up going with the smaller size. they're not really a size too big, but would've been a little too roomy/baggy in the waist, had i not purchased the smaller.",1
I loved this dress immediately.  i got the blue and orange and love the combination of the top fabric and the flowy skirt.  only one complaint.  it's a bit short on one side so i'll have to wait for cooler weather to wear it with tights (if i want to wear it to work).,1

"I ordered these because of the side zipper, but they zip in front, even though the order listing and bag label called them ""wine, side zip pants."" they were also at least two sizes larger than marked and very flimsy material. what bothers me is that i was charged $5.95 to send them back, even though the product description (and the name before someone changed it on the website) were wrong.",0

This would have been a cute top but the shoulder seams come halfway down the arm and give it a really weird shape. it looks smooth and fine on the model but in real life they stick out and make you look boxy. too bad!,0
"Love the color and design but way to small. i can wear a small in many manufacturers but certainly not in this one. the medium was like an extra small. sorry because i liked what i saw in the advertisement.

When i returned this the salesperson asked what was wrong w it bc it keeps being returned. i got the black w the white collar/cuffs. i thought it was terribly itchy material (which could be remedied w a shirt underneath) but the white collar part was such a dull ugly white-dirty color. maybe the other colors are better?,0

"Okay, i am not that tall and don't have legs for miles, but i loving wearing a wide-legged cropped pant with heels for a change from the everyday. these pants are great because they are 99% cotton. the cotton is a nice weight (not too light) and the barely there fringe bottom is a nice detail. i usually wear a 28 in pilcro and that's what i bought! i would describe the color as leaning more toward khaki than green, though it did look little green under the lights in the store.",1
"I love these pants, they are soft versatile and stylish! great choice!",1
"This top is adorable and has a looser fit (as shown on the model shot), so i would have liked to size down; however, the arms are extremely fitted/tight and there's no way i could have fit my arms into the next size down. if you have slim arms, maybe you could size down and make this work.",0
This is a very soft and comfortable jacket but it has holes in the pocket area. it was returned to the store and the other jackets had the same problem although not in the same area. the store was considering pulling the product off their shelves. it is unclear if the holes are just the beginning of a pocket or what. but it was flawed by everyone who looked at it.,0
"Pilcro has become my go to brand for pants as they always seem to fit with consistent sizing.  i'm an 8-10 and size 30 never fails to fit perfectly.  i've got hips and a booty so it's great to have a brand that works with my curves.  these chinos are super soft and feel like pants i've had for years -- broken in but still look polished.  i bought the green (which is really teal) and feel in love with them. i've since bought the gray and sand/khaki color.  i'm 5'6"" and the length hits just below",1
"I love these pants, i actually bought them twice! the special dye in them did not agree with my detergent so i bought another pair on sale.....some woolite and will wash them inside out/hang to dry. will take better care of my second pair.",1
"I like the grey pattern and black and white contrast versions the best! very soft and falls nicely on my bust. the biggest differences wit the sizes are on length, so i ordered up for it would be a bit longer. it's a great piece.",1
"I ordered the geometric, blue/red pattern in a small regular. the material was soft and comfortable. it is a stand-out piece but unfortunately, it made my stomach look like it was sticking out too much. the neck line did not stay flat against my chest which resulted in an ill-fitting, bunched up look. i returned this one. for reference, i'm 5'4"" 120lbs 34 a.",0
I bought this in the reddish color. i was a little skeptical that the fit or style would really work on a petite person but it looks great on. the fabric is very soft but with enough body that the cowl keeps it's shape. i predict that people will get tired of seeing me in this as i'm going to wear it a lot.,1
"Hi,

like the other reviewers, i expected the price to be much higher. it is so warm, yet so flattering and cute. this will sell out, so buy now if you want it.",1
"This is a well made sweater. i sometimes have a problem with wool but this is as soft as cashmere and does not itch at all. the color is beautiful and will work with gray,black,tan and navy. i found this to run a little bit on the large side. i am between a size large and extra large and ordered the extra large. there is too much fabric on the sides and the peplum starts at an awkward spot, mid hip instead of waistline. i think that sizing down to a large will solve these problems. it is really",1
"Purchased this sweater in an xs, grey pattern (for reference, 5'4"", small frame) and was worried it would be too overwhelming. this is not the case! the pattern is the perfect scale and the sweater hit just right. it seems to be true to size. i especially love the bracelet length turned back sleeves. it's a little pricey, but i think it will be worth it because it is so different!",1
"I am a solid 14 and the size l fit nicely. it's easy to wear. the diagonal print is quite flattering. my husband liked it. i am 5'9"" and it was a bit short, but not too short. i've not washed it yet so can't say how that will go. the fabric is knit but does not look like it will pill.",1
"I absolutely love these shorts. i ordered a medium. i was nervous they would be too small, (my legs aren't the skinniest), but because of the slit on the side, they were fine. i do have a pretty tiny waist, and they were slightly snug but not too much to send them back. i am almost 5'7' and weight 145. i have a solid black one piece suit and they look great with it. i love the material as well, they are extremely comfortable. a little pricey, but i will definitely make use of them. i love the pr",1
"I was confused by this dress. the heavy fabric made me think of winter but the cut and print are springy. it's also not lined and the material is not exactly soft. i put it back. cute, but missed the mark.",0
"Cute dress, runs small, especially in the sleeves and chest (i usually wear a 0 and purchased a 2). the outer layer is very sheer and while the print and shape are cute, the quality could be better, especially for the price.",1
"Well - i was disappointed in the fabric for this dress. it is a heavier material and i suspect will not be very cool / comfortable during warmer weather when i would normally wear a sleeveless dress.
on the upside - the pattern is really pretty.",0
"I really had high hopes for this dress. i had several issues with it, though based on the high ratings other customers did not experience the same problems. 
1- it was to short. i am 5'8"" and it was really really short on me. i could not sit down in it. 
2- i found that it ran large. i've lost some weight recently, so perhaps i've gone down a size, but the medium was like a sack on me. 
3-the waist was really roomy. it ballooned out to the point that it was comical. 
4- as others have noted,",0
"I really like this dress/shirt. it's great for layering, super cute and will hide my traditional holiday and this year's pregnancy weight gain. i think it will be so cute with some leggings and boots.

unfortunately the back panel of the dress does not seem to vary based on the size. this may sound weird but i've tried on an 8 and a 10 and the ability to reach forward didn't change between the two sizes. i just returned the 10 and am hopeful the 12 i ordered will be slightly roomier in the back.",0
Listed on the package labeling but not in the product description. i am short in the waist and this is still much shorter than pictured. disappointed to send this one back as it's otherwise perfect.,0
"It is so cute in the picture but wasn't flattering on me. it also felt like i couldn't raise my arms while wearing it. i love retailer and will be a forever fan, but this dress just wasn't for me.",0
"The first thing i noticed upon receiving this dress is how soft it is and the fact that it wasn't wrinkled coming out of the packaging bag- an excellent quality! my next surprise was to find that it is fully lined with a very nice soft knit and felt awesome on. i ordered a size small and it fit perfectly- it was fitted through my waist and hips (37 chest, 28.5 waist, 37 hips) and dropped straight from my hips just like i like. i was afraid it would be too sheath like for my figure but it is perf",1
"I just bought the grey, and now i'm coming back for the black and cream i lovethis staple item!! so soft fits great!",1
"This top fit perfectly but too much of my bra was showing through the black lace. it would be a great top to use as loungewear, though.",0
Very unique shirt-- you will get a compliment! the material has a great feel and weight. beautiful color. it runs true to size.,1
I wore this sweater while gathering ingredients for my thanksgiving feast and 3 different women at whole foods complimented my sweater. it is soft and warm. would love in other colors too...like a mint green.,1
I think this dress is adorable . it fits great. wear it with heels or cowboy boots. you will not be disappointed,1
"This dress is adorable, but it unfortunately didn't work for me. i agree with the reviews that stated the fabric is very heavy",1
The top is a pretty design. it's a low v-neck. but it would be nice for layering. it was just way to tight. runs small. order up a size.,0
"I wanted to love this dress so much and am so sad - it just didn't work for me. i am 5'2"", 138 pounds (still trying to lose that last 5-8 from my third daughter) and the chest/back of this dress was so tight i was afraid if i hugged someone it would split up the back. i am normally a size 6 and tried the 6 p, 8 p and 8 and they were all too tight in the chest/back. it sounds like this is common for these holding horses dresses. :(",0
This is adorable but if it truly has to be dry-cleaned that is deal killer,0
"When i first saw this dress, it honestly didn't catch my eye, but as i kept seeing it in on the catalog and other places on pinterest, i realized how unique this dress is. i looked at the reviews and was surprised at how negative the comments were- i'm the type of lady who gets stuck on something and won't get off of it until i try it for myself. so, i ordered it on sale and i love it! it isn't flannel material, and so i wasn't expecting this to be a dress that would keep me warm by itself- but",1
This is a cute dress but the fabric is very heavy and i didn't find it to drape well on me. it is a very heavy felted poly type of fabric. i ordered it for a specific event coming up this summer and the fabric will not work for warm temps. the style and design of the dress is great though. for reference it did fit fairly true to size. i wear a 0 or 2. the xs fit well. if the fabric works for your situation then i would try this dress.,0
"I ordered a size small. i am 5'7"" size 6 and the dress was a mini on me! way shorter than on the taller model. the stomach and hips gaped out from my body yet the waist was cut way too high, so the dress was both too small and too big! very odd fit. the material is soft, thick, stretchy and has a textured pattern which i liked. this one is going back.",0
Heavier fabric than it looks but cute and versatile. flattering as well!,1
"Dress runs a little small in the arms but flows nicely on the body. see through and comes with slip but slip is stiff and doesn't give. was hard to get on so i wore my own slip. other that that, dress is feminine and looks great on!",1
"This dress is perfection! great, quality fabric. bright vibrant color. the design and texture allow it to be dressed up or dressed down. i sized up a size because my normal wasn't available and it fits perfectly!",1
"These are my favorite tights. i love how they are opaque. i love that they are thick but not so thick as to be only appropriate for winter. they are slimming without feeling too tight.

why don""t you sell these any more??? please bring them back!",1
"I initially worried about these because i am curvy on the bottom and short (5'3), but they balance me out perfectly. they are light and airy and perfect for summer. i have paired them with form fitting tops which work best considering the bottom volume., and my latigo clogs which give me some height. these are my new favorite go-to pants!",1
"I was so excited to purchase this dress for my masters graduation party. it looks beautiful on but i could not get over one little detail. the structure of the top falls funny on your chest - a bit too high from the rest of the pulled fabric. it doesn't look right. if you have a necklace that falls perfectly on the piece of fabric, like the main photo shown, you are good. the third photo with the short necklace shows this issue best.",0
"I bought this dress to attend a couple of summer weddings. it seemed like it would be a nice, light summer dress that i could wear all day. i do think it fits that qualification, however, it wasn't as flattering as i hoped. i'm generally pear shaped - small waist, larger hips. this dress does fit well over my hips, but does very little to show off my waist. overall, it is just ok.",1
"These are fab as always with pure good printed leggings. bright, beautiful print, great quality fabric, and flattering. goes with lots of color tops too! took my usual size s (4/27 in bottoms) and found them perfect.",1
"I love these tights! i stock up every year. they are a great quality, not too thick to be hot, but not too thin that they are sheer when you put them on. they also don't squeeze you at the waistline. favorite tights.",1
This dress is a lovely fit. the knit top accentuates the bust and the loose skirt below the empire waist just skims the figure. it's pretty casual and the skirt is a tiny bit sheer so better for weekends than for office wear.,1
"I should preface this by saying that i'm in between sizes. i chose the smaller size and found that this top is not super forgiving. i'm keeping it bc it is good quality and i like the style, but i wouldn't be comfortable wearing it right now! maybe after i lose a few pounds!",1
I love the style the lightness and the fit ... but the fabric in the skirt just did not meet my expectations. this might be something to find at a mass retailer. i guess i simply prefer a natural fabric.,0
"I was so looking forward to wearing these pants on an upcoming trip. i already had my outfits planned! when these pants arrived, however, they were very different from those shown in the pictures online. firstly, the pants are, in actuality, quite cropped. i am 5'9-- the model in the pictures is at least that height, if not taller-- and the hems were several inches above my ankles. secondly, the pants appear to be an even wider cut than what's shown, although the width of the pant legs may have",0
"I read the other reviews before i purchased this jumpsuit because it's very cute. as another 5'3"" reviewer mentioned it will be longer so for me that's a plus but i have thighs, not huge but regular well proportioned woman thighs and boobs. it was a little tight but doable around my thighs but my boobs got ""lost in the sauce"". i gotta love it to keep it and i don't. it's a great print and fabric though.",0
"I really wanted to like this dress, but where the skirt meets the top of the dress in the back creates sort of a hunchback effect in the back. will be returning.",0
"I own a couple of pairs of natori hipsters and recently purchased the yellow to go with the front close natori bra. i tried to wear thong panties but they just didn't work for me. thankfully, natori makes these lovely panties that still make me feel sexy and they are way more comfortable. they also receive rave reviews from my husband. : )",1
"This wide leg pant gives the perception of a skirt that is feminine, comfortable, and moves beautifully when you walk. can be used all year round!",1
Cute little sleep mask! the elastic band is wide so it doesn't ever feel like it's digging into your head. does a very good job keeping out light.,1
"I have had a problem finding jeans that fit properly (that i don't have to pull up every single time i walk up the stairs or stand up) but these are perfect. they are made with a bit of a stretchy material, yet keep their shape well. i am 5'7, 130 pounds, athletic body type and got a size 25. the only thing i am worried about is the dark color bleeding onto a light colored couch/quilt/purse/etc. as this has happened to me before with dark wash jeans.",1
"I loved the romantic look of this robe and gown set, but the material was very thin and wrinkled and needs to be ironed. the m/l was uncomfortable and i normally wear only a m. sadly, i returned the set.",0
"I have to agree with another reviewer - this blouse has an odd fit! the small petite (my usual size) was a good length and there was plenty of room in the body, however i found the shoulders to be quite small which made the neckline pull. since i definitely do not have broad shoulders this may be a particular problem for those that do. i also found the gathered seam above the bustline and across the upper back resulted in an unflattering maternity top effect. the blouse i was sent had one sleeve",0
"This skirt ran short, small, and boxy. if you can get the right fit, the skirt is great quality and super cute, but i recommend trying on in store for sizing.",0
"I did not like the fit of this. as another reviewer stated, it is not a swing tunic. it hangs fairly straight. i don't have large hips. i'm 5'8"" and 120 lbs with a full bust and this did not look flattering. i returned it immediately.",0
"This was not what i was expecting. at all. i am a medium in just about everything but ordered a large to possibly wear this as a dress instead of a tunic since i am around 5' 4"". the large fit like a small on me, and not like a typical oversized sweater type small, but a normal fitted top small. a previous reviewer said it is long and straight, and i think that is a good description for it. i think the models wearing this in the pictures are all wearing an extra-large #or a different cut of the",0
It's comfortable and easy to wear with lots of styles.,1
"The item i received was not distressed. i bought one size larger thinking they'd be super slouchy, but they just looked sloppy. also, the hips puffed out in a very strange way. i wanted to love since they are so cute and soft, but i look like a man with hips in these jeans. returning this weekend.",0
"I ordered this online, but i own the vest and i love it, so i took a chance. this is a super comfy, great quality jacket. the sleeves are some kind of knit material and that makes it really cozy and not constrictive. the color, i ordered the green, is perfect. i ultimately returned the jacket because i thought the lapels were just too wide for my liking. they look exactly like the picture so if you don't mind that, you will probably be very happy with this jacket. it just wasn't for me. i ended",1
"This top is simple but beautiful. i am either a large or xl but purchased this in the xl. it is a swing top, but has a beautiful flow to it which is not overbearing. i am around 5'6"" and slightly on the broad side and do not feel overpowered by this shirt at all.
i love a top that can be worn everyday with a pair of jeans or dressed up with a pair of slacks. the plus to this top is that it can born worn almost year round which i like.
a great staple for your closet.",1
"This skirt is fabulous!!! i ordered it in both grey and green. only flaw was the grey one was 2 inches shorter all the way around (made it too short!!!), so i kept the green. great for summer and maybe fall with flats and a jacket.",1
"This skirt is soft and comfortable, breathes and moves really nicely. great quality and fabric, just be careful in the first wear i snagged a spot with my rings. i ordered my usual medium, but probably could have sized down to a small. i plan to wear this all the time.",1
"This is another one of those darned swing tops. i can't even with this trend. this shirt has such a nice print/color palette going on but it's ruined by the swing cut/henley combo- it looked like i was a little kid wearing an oversized men's night shirt/smock? i don't know, it was just not at all flattering. i ordered my regular size large and a medium would have worked and probably still been generously cut. i disagree with a reviewer who said it might work for larger sizes.. this just made my",0
"Description is wrong. not a swing tunic. more long and straight. keep that in mind when buying this. if you have hips, this might not be the top for you",0
"I tried on the grey version in store, and it was significantly longer than pictured. the back came down to just below my knee, which looked awkward with the split sides. i am 5'4"" and this was a regular (not petite) size. however, the overall quality of the fabric was good and it seemed durable.",0
"This shirt had everything going for it - the cut, the length, the fun texture, but when i stepped into the light it was totally see through. i don't want to have to wear another shirt underneath. this one is going back. definitely not a swing, but still cute.",0
I am amazed this is still on sale. it's so comfortable and fabulous!!,1
"I thought these were gorgeous and was going to buy them although the price was a bit high. in fact, two separate women came up to me as i was walking around the store and asked where i got the pants because the colors are so vivid. however, as we were looking at the items, we noticed that both the green and the blue both had several small holes in them due to stitching quality, as the previous reviewer noted. therefore, none of us purchased the pants.

the staff at the store were very helpful",0
"This dress was cute but the fit was not quite right. the bottom half fit well but the top half was a little loose. it was wearable but i was worried after wearing for a few hours it would stretch out even more and look frumpy. like other reviewers have said, this dress really needs a belt to bring it together. i ended up returning it because i didn't love it.",0
"I know that some folks said it runs small, but i am usually a size small or medium in dresses and the medium feels big to me. that being said, it definitely works, and i think it'll be great. excited to dress it up with accessories- feels professional enough for me to teach in.",1

i'm a bit confused on the sizing for this, especially based on other reviews mentioning they needed to size up. i ordered the xs, and i was swimming in it. i usually am quite comfortable in size small, so i'm not sure why the xs was still too big. perhaps you need hips for this dress to work, because it was really just hanging on me and not figure flattering at all. i'm not sure if ordering the xxs would make thi",1
"I only gave this three stars due more to personal preference than to any real flaws with the product. it is very comfortable and for a jersey-style shirt quite warm. but that is one of my issues with the shirt. i wanted to wear it well into spring and i think it'll be just too warm. (i live in the northeast) i also felt that while it fit tts it had a more generous fit than what i expected, which was another negative for me. i wanted it to be more fitted to my body. however, i did keep it because",1

"Really wanted to like this and took chances based on other reviews, even with the sale price and addtl discount. it's basically $30 blouse fabric with design and detail-work of a much more expensive blouse. the white is sheer and and fabric will wrinkle easily. if it were black, you could probably get away with it, but the white shows too many flaws and will wrinkle. sad to have to send it back.",0
"I ordered a large, and was hopeful that this would be as comfy and stylish as others reviewed. for me, it was not. it ran a little small on top, buttons bulged at my chest, and was hard to put on. bottom part fit well (although flattened my butt unflatteringly). i'm sure this works for some, just wasn't the right fit for me. sent it back.",0

This is a beautiful dress. i sized up 2 sizes based on other reviews and it fits well. it is on the shorter side. i purchased the blue and it's a beautiful color. i was in love with the dress until the zipper burst open after wearing it for five minutes. i think i'm going to have the zipper replaced because i like it so much. but at the high price point there should be a functional zipper.,1
"I like the fabric - very smooth and feels nice on the skin. i like the handkerchief hemline too.i didn't realize how much i would not like the neckline. it feels too tight and too high to me and i'm not sure i could wear this for long without pulling at the neck. also, the fit is loose, maybe a bit too loose for my taste. but it's the neck fit that makes me have to return this dress.",0
I ordered this dress in the green color. the dress did not look like the picture. i returned the dress since it looked like something to wear to a farm barnyard dance. i returned the dress.,0
I love this dress! i generally wear size 10 and the medium fits perfect. i'm a curvy lady and this dress fits great. i've received many compliments on it and might even get another pattern because i love it so much!,1

"I was hoping this dress was a bit thicker, but when i tried it on the fabric was very thin and sheer. because of the body skimming design, this dress likely won't work on many without some serious spanx or body trimming hosiery. if you work out and are very fit, you might like it, but i don't so i'm not that brave! lol",0
"I loved this dress. it runs small (i'm normally a 2) so i had to get a 4. in the fitting room, the zippers got stuck a lot. i assumed it was just from the way the waist was sewn in. finally i found a dress that would zip pretty well. 

i went to put on this dress for my rehearsal dinner the night before my wedding. my fiance and i tried in vain for 20 minutes to try to zip it up... and then it broke. the part that was zipped became unzipped and the zipper had no where to go. it was awful. i co",0

"I have the long sleeved version of this dress and was super excited to try on the sleeveless version, but it just didn't work nearly as well. the armholes are huge and will definitely show quite a bit of bra. the black pattern was also nothing special. i like the mock turtleneck and the dress has a nice swingy feel - would consider getting it if it went on sale. 

i tried on the small and the extra small - didn't notice a difference between the two. i think i have on the xs in the photo.",0
"I bought this online so didn't realize that the fabric at the bottom is very, very stiff. i was expecting something silky, or at least on the softer and more moveable side. the best description i can think of is an overly starched mens dress shirt. that being the case, it kind of juts out in weird places. the sweater part is very nice, but it is somewhat closer fitting than what it seems in the picture. the fabric bottom is too ample for the slimmer design of the sweater which just adds to the o",0

"Just a heads up because i didn't notice the pink in the blue motif print until it had arrived. almost sent it back - changes the overall aesthetic, makes it harder to layer in winter, black shoes stand out more etc... but i don't really like the orange print and i'm a red head... so i'm keeping it but it would have been amazing if it were cream and blue. i also bought the emerson swing dress. this dress runs tts (emerson runs a touch larger). i'm 5'5"" and the dress came to just barely above my k",1
This is a super cute dress which is quite flattering. it is made with a higher waist and a bit of a fit and flare. the only complaint is the side zipper which seems to get caught and not move easily.,1
"This dress is super comfortable and flattering.  i went with the stripes (and the p to shorten the length) -- it looks amazing with otk boots.  however, the material isn't very thick; it's more of a fall/spring dress than a winter.  i'm a xs-s p in retailer dresses - i went with the small.  xs would've fit but less flatteringly",1
"Loved this dress when i tried it on in the store and thought it would be perfect for a casual wedding. unfortunately, the day of the wedding the zipper split and i had to wear something else. it fit well, but was poorly made. based off other reviews, this isn't the first time this has happened with this dress! not worth the risk at all.",0
"Love everything about this dress...cut, color, material and price!",1
"A cute dress, though waist a little too high (more of an empire waist... hitting at widest part of rib cage). this looks like it should be a stretchy knit dress, but the detailing has no give whatsoever and the dress runs quite small. i usually wear a 00, but though i could get it zipped, it wasn't comfortable, and if i want to keep it, i'll need to size up to a 0. i'm 5'6"", 32b-24-35.",1
"I finally pressed 'go' on the orange dress during the weekend sale. the dress is terrific. i am a busty (36dd) size 8/10 and the m fits perfectly. based on the reviews, i had planned to take this to the tailor to take in the armholes, but it is not necessary at all - no bra showing in front or back. i am 5'6"" and the shortest part of the hem is about 2"" above my knee. there is no lining, so i might add a short pull-on slip depending on where i wear it, but otherwise this is an easy dress to be w",1
"I so wanted to love this little dress, but it just didn't fit my body well. as suggested by others, i ordered a size up, and it did fit. the fabric is stretchy, so there is some give there, but the size zip was a little sticky, because the trim causes a lot of fabric to be bunched along the zipper. the real problem was that the dress was too short-waisted for me. the waist band came right under my chest. maybe this would fit someone with a small-or mid-sized bust better than it did me. i also th",1
"This is a really cute dress, just did not look flattering on me at all. i suppose i could have gone down a size, however i just did not love it. i am 5'3"" 130#, athletic build, 36dd. i read the other reviews and everyone loves this dress. here is what i did not like. there are pockets, which i cannot figure out the purpose, that lay oddly all bunched up right at the hips. due to the shape of the dress, it bunches out. on my short frame, it made me look shorter and wider. the fabric is a lightwei",1
"This will be a great go to piece with leggings and boots for winter and to transition into spring with wedges. i purchased the blue stripe and the multi stripe with the intention of returning one but i liked them enough to keep both. the quality of material is great and super soft and i love the little snap detail on the sleeves. i am 5' 7"", and most always wear a size medium and it fit perfect. the dress hit right above the knee but not too high so i can wear the dresses with or without tights.",1
Absolutely love this dress! so cute with booties and a jean jacket. will be a great staple for spring and fall,1
"This dress is really lovely. i purchased in the blue green color and think the pattern and ribbon detailing is gorgeous. it runs very small - i am normally a 00p in maeve, and in this dress, due to the length, ended up with a 2 regular. i like my dresses to fit and could have gone with the 0 - it fit well at the waist but was tighter than i prefer across the chest and wanted a more comfortable fit. as other reviewers have noted, it has a higher waist which i think contributes to the sizing issue",1
"Totally agree with the other reviewer!  just got this in the mail today and it is a beautiful dress but it does run one size too small.  i am always a size 8 in maeve but couldn't zip this one up!  and at 5""7' it is a tad short but i'm exchanging it for the 10 in the hope that in the next size it will be a bit longer--and that it will fit!  but it is a super flattering fit!!  and the blue color pops! a stunning dress and love that it's machine washable!",1
Lovely dress in bright teal color. the zipper was a bit sticky as the other reviewers had mentioned. unfortunately i sized up (6) based on past reviews and had to exchange for a smaller size(4). the fabric does have a bit of stretch so i'm really not sure why so many people had sizing issues. this is really a great buy with the current sale. tempted to pick up the red version too.,1
"This dress looks and feels cheap. the white material is stiff and does not iron nicely. the grey sweater is super thin and very cheap looking. overall, a pretty horrible dress. save your money,",0
"These are absolutely beautiful pants. soft and wearable right away, but the other reviewer is right. if you are average or short, these will be way too long. they won't even look like cropped pants, just regular wide leg jeans. i am keeping them b/c i love the look and i will also have them altered to be shorter. it's disappointing that these were designed for the statuesque instead of the other 90% of us, especially considering the amazingly high price for a pair of jeans. so... i guess i am di",0
"I wanted to like this dress, but it just did not work for a bustier frame. the fabric is quite loose, does not nip in at the waist and is not particularly clingy, so if you are well-endowed, your assets create a bit of a shelf from which the rest of the dress just hangs. as a result, the swing comes from the apex of your chest as opposed to from your hips (as on the model), and the asymmetrical hemline makes the look even more awkward. on smaller curves, this would likely be very flattering, but",0
"I am 5'4"", 145 pounds, 34dd and ended up with the size small for reference. it fit well but definitely roomy - in case you're not into that style. never tried the extra small, but i would prefer this dress not to hug onto me so i stayed with the small. 

this dress was really nice and comfy, soft material. the pockets are low and my phone stayed in while i walked but i wouldn't recommend anything heavier than a phone to go in the pockets. 

i wore this to a family and friends function and re",1
"First off - i love these jeans... they are the exact look i have been searching for, and the bands around the hem are what really sold me on this specific pair. the only problem - which i found with a previous purchase - is that they hit me at the ankle, rather than what is pictured. since i liked everything about these jeans, i decided to so with plan b and had them altered to be about an inch shorter. this involved cutting the hem at the top of the bands and reattaching... the stitching blends",1
"I ordered the neutral and this dress feels and looks great. but my issue is with the fabric. while very comfortable, it fades where its stretched. so around my bust and my back when i moved my arms. i am 5'9"", 145 lbs and the small fit me the best but i tried on the medium just to see if it was a fit issue. the fabric still looked weird. i'm disappointed to send it back but i just can't keep it.",0
"I bought this dress for my daughter for her birthday and she loved it! she tells me she has worn it many times and gets compliments each time on both the style and the color (ordered the orange). it's a lovely lightweight knit and is easy to dress up or down, plus it is so comfortable and flattering!",1
I have several maeve dresses that fit really well. this was not the case with this dress. fabric and color are great! fit was off especially in top. worst part was zipper that wouldn't move smoothly. took me a good 15 minutes to get it unzipped. such a bummer!,0
"I'll start by saying that i loved this dress. i tried it on in the dressing room and knew i had to have it. the colors and design are beautiful and the fabric is soft. i did have to size up but it fit me perfectly once i did. i'm 5'1"" 130 lbs 34 d size 6 fit great. 
the first time i pulled it out at home, i was gently pulling up the zipper and once it hits those ribbon areas on the side, the zipper seam split. i tried for a half hour to get it to realign. i finally decided to go exchange it for",0
"This dress is so cute! i went to the store to try it on and although i knew the dress would fit i could not get the zipper up. my mom, the sales lady and i all tried to get the zipper up and it would not move past the ribbon. i wish i could have bought this dress but i can't without a working zipper. i tried a size up and every dress at the store that was my size and none of them worked. please fix the zipper problem so i can have this dress!",0
"I agree with the other reviewers. i ordered 2 of these but had to return both because the zippers didn't work. when i returned them, the saleslady said many people had problems with them.",0
"I ran into retailer today and was very excited to see this dress since i had liked it online but wanted to be able to try it on based on reviews. it does run small for maeve.  typically with maeve a 2 fits better on me but i can always wear a 4. in this dress the 4 just fit. it is darling. i got the red and i love the fabric detail and stitched detail. however, the zipper is awful! no way around it, terrible! when i went to try this on at the store the zipper split just opening it to try th",1
This dress is so cute but it's going back. the zipper is horrible and all of the other reviews are true - you'll need to size up.,0
"The blue version of this dress originally caught my eye on-line, but wasn't available in the store, so i tried the green one, mainly for size since everyone said it runs a bit small. i did have to size up one or two sizes. i fell in love with the green dress and bought it. it is so comfortable, great quality fabric (not too thin or too heavy). looks great on. i have received several compliments.",1
"I love this dress so much, i've considered getting it in the other prints. it's fitted in all the right places and has pockets! i love that it's stretchy. i'm a 36d and it's hard to fit dresses over the chest. this dress is a dream!",1
Very pretty but too short for my age. looks well made and green dress is beautiful. it was just too short for me to be comfortable wearing.,0
"This dress is so comfortable and versatile. you can dress it up or down and it's perfect for almost any summer occasion. i have it in the black color and it goes with almost everything! the only complaint i have is the arm holes drop a little too low. you can see part of my bra because of this but it's not too drastic. i'm 5'4"" with an athletic build and i feel like the petite would have fit me better. regardless, it's a great dress.",1
"I bought this dress in the navy stripe version and love it. the material is so soft it's like wearing pajamas, and the actual swing skirt is flattering (which surprised me when i tried it on). i wore it to work with burgundy heels and got a lot of compliments from my co-workers. i'm 5'9"", 130 lbs and the xs worked best for me.",1
"I tried a size x small on in the store and i am 5'4"" 120 lbs. i had trouble getting my head through the dress, and once i did it felt so tight at the neck, as if it was chocking me. the dress color is very nice but the tight neck and odd arm holes were a no. i would not recommend this dress for those reasons.",0
"This dress is very comfy and soft. i am returning because i didn't like it being a turtle neck, just a personal dislike.",1
"I should have listened to the previous review on-line before ordering. unfortunately this will go back as the design fit and proportions are simply off. i love uniquely shaped wraps like this, but this one didn't make the cut for me.",0
"I was really looking forward to getting this dress in the orange print, but when i finally received, i was a little disappointed. the print placement is not the same as shown on the model, so it doesn't look as a vibrant and colorful. my version of the dress has more of that muddy dark print and hardly any orange or turquoise. also the backside of the print is white and the dress is not lined. i do like the way it drapes on my body and the overall styling. the dress fits nicely in size medium on",1
"I love this dress, it's very comfortable, slim swing and very ingratiating. the fabric is light, i like the details of the buttons on the sleeves. overall, i'm pleased and happy for the purchase of this dress. i will definitely recommend it.",1
"I ordered the red version--it is incredibly cute, soft, vibrant, and a flattering a-line. however, this dress is sized oddly, running at least one or two sizes too small, particularly at the waistband. i ordered my usual size and one size up, and even the larger size was too snug in the waist.  yet at the same time, i had some gaping at the straps, and i have a full bust. even worse is the *impossible* side-zipper that is a workout to get past the seam at the waistband. trying to wrestle the zip",0
"Cute, easy fitting dress. i got it in orange, which is a summery, pretty print. i ordered it in petite because i am 5'1"", but the dress is very short, so i'm exchanging it for a regular size. if you're average height, be aware that the dress will be well above the knee.",1
"I was so excited when this dress arrived today. as other reviewers have mentioned, the fabric is lovely, soft and drapey and it feels great on. it felt great, that is, until i looked in the mirror. while the dress fit fine, i have a large bust, and the fabric stretched across the bust, causing the print to appear washed out across the bust. not a good look. sigh. another return.",0
"I love this dress, it's flattering and a nice a line cut that is comfortable to wear, however there are 2 issues with this dress as mentioned by others. the dress is cut at least 1 size too small and the zipper is very difficult. typically i'm a 0 in mauve and i went up to a 2 as the 0 doesn't fit my (petite) rib cage. the zipper is annoying, but i can deal with it for the half off sale price i got with an additional 30% off.  i wouldn't have purchased this dress if it were full price, however.",1
"It's not totally apparent in all of the photos, but this dress does have a very noticeable a-symmetric hemline. i have read other reviewers that have said this dress is ""forgiving"" and a good choice for people with an hourglass frame. if you are truly an hourglass (small waist, larger shoulders and hips due to bone structure rather than weight,) this dress is a poor choice. the fabric of this dress tends to cling to the outermost hip, and the a-symmetry of this particular hemline not only draws",0
"Oh, i wanted this dress to work! i bought it in green, red and the solid blue. all ran really small. i *just* fit in a 10, when i would normally take a 6 in retailer sizes (5'8"" and 140 lbs). as with many other reviewers, i also noticed that the zipper was a huge flaw. it took a long, slow motion to get it zipped because it would get stuck on the fabric variations. such a cute style, was really bummed it didn't work. i kept ordering it in other colors thinking i would hit the jackpot, but they wer",0
"I love the design of this tunic. it is sewn well, but the fabric is cheap. i disliked the texture of the fabric so much that i returned it.",0
"Was really excited to get this, but got it on and i was swimming in it. i'm not a tiny girl thicker athletic build and the large was massive. sadly had to return. don't know if i'll try a size down.",1
"This is cute! i've been so looking forward to it, but it's big!! i'm usually a small in retailer size, medium most of the time otherwise. i ordered the medium, but it's way too big. doesn't fit at all like the pictures. sadly, it's going back, hopefully for a much smaller size. but other than this, it's lovely",1
"This dress looks cute in the picture and i was hopeful since it was actually silk. i'm tired of paying close to $200 for dresses that are polyester or viscose. that being said, this dress simply had too much going on. the fabrics aren't only mixed, but there is also a faint underlying pattern on the fabric that is the same shade of the main color of fabric. it was simply too much and the black lace trim made it look kind of cheap. my real issue is that although the dress itself ran big, the uppe",0
"This is literally the most unflattering thing i have ever tried on from retailer. the sleeves are so weird and ugly. they get really fat at the top, like a dolman sleeve, but it looks really strange because they don?t flow into the rest of the top, which is very structured. it made my shoulders look huge even though i have very narrow shoulders. this is not apparent in the model picture at all. the thick black seams at the shoulders are also placed in a really awkward spot which also contri",0
I am not sure who would look good in this dress. it is extremely oversized with tons of fabric that will not flatter anyone!,0
"I live in ny and bought his coat for the winter, thinking since it was made out of wool it would be warm. this coat is extremely thing, more like a spring/fall coat and therefore i don't think the price justifies the quality. i am going to return and consider repurchasing if it goes on sale. i also wish it had a button or way of keeping it closed rather than just hang loosely.",0
I really wanted to love this top. love the mix of fabrics and patterns. but it is too short for a tunic length. i should have paid attention to other reviews. i'm about 5'8'' and was not too tight in the bust and shoulders.i have to return because the length isn't right.,0
"I was looking forward to this cute top to get me through the winter, but the combination of the very think fabric and boxy shape did not work on my 5'2"", 130 lb, 34d figure. the one i received also had an open unfinished seam beneath the zipper. i imagine this would be a great top for someone taller.",0
"I really thought i would love this dress the style is really nice and the material is great. however, the length made me feel like i looked short and kind of stumpy. i feel like this dress would look really good on somebody that is more like 6ft, not my 5'6"" self.",0
"Ref: 5'4"", 125# 27/4, 32g. i don't think this is for us shorter women. this hits you right where you don't want a vertical line to hit. it flares out at your hip and makes you look shorter than you are. the fabric is like a double gauze and very soft and the colors are beautiful but i couldn't even dream of making this work. i thought maybe with my larger bust it would create shape but it looks like i just wrapped a bunch of fabric around me! glad i tried in-store and didn't online order.",0
"Love the colors for fall, feels good and perfect for work. size seems to run a little large but overall works really well and can go to work and out at night - perfect!",1
"I loved this top online but it arrived very wrinkled which raised a red flag as to how it would look after wearing it. seemed high maintenance. also, didn't love the fit. color is vibrant but overall not a fan of this top.",0
"I love this sweater. it's heavy, with a rich texture that feels like very cool grandma. the cut is straight, and the collar feels natural. a small wraps closed across my chest (usually a s/4/6) without being baggy. falls to my mid-calf at 5'6"".",1
"Love just know the embroidery is navy blue wearing them today, size down",1
"I really loved the fabric of this dress, however, it had a weird fit and the pockets made the front hang funny.",1
"I am so pleased with my purchase. the two different levels of the dress is just simply fun and unique. the attached matching, adjustable baby blue slip is a nice add. neither the dress or slip fit too tight or too loose around my torso. i ordered a small which fits me perfect and in case it is helpful, i am 5'7"", 133, and a 36a. 
if you have been considering this dress, don't delay, especially at the wonderful sale price!",1
"Man do i love this dress! love the fit and the quality of the fabric, lays really nicely. i gave it only four stars because it is super short. true i am 5'11"" but there is no way i could wear this without pants or leggings. i am super bummed because i really love it but must send it back.",1
"I stalked this sold out product for weeks hoping my size would become available. when it did, i was very excited, in fact i ordered both a s and xs to be sure one sweater would fit me! unfortunately, neither did and i felt the actual sweater was not as pictured. the sweater has an overall baggy fit and the cutouts don't fall as neatly and as evenly on both shoulders as the picture shows, making the look a bit sloppy in my opinion. it is such a shame as this look is very of the moment and the mod",0
Love this dress so much. it's super comfortable and i always get a ton of compliments every time i wear it. the fabric is the perfect weight not too heavy. i'll be wearing this all summer long.,1
"I love the length of this - no danger of explosing my muffin-top! the fabric is super cute - good weight, pretty color. i got a medium which is a bit blousy - i think i could have gone with a small.",1
"I bought this top in the store, which was good because i ended up wearing a size smaller than i usually do. i loved the flowy fit of it. the washing instructions say machine wash cold, tumble dry low. i washed it on cold and hung it to dry. it shrank to the point of being unwearable (the dreaded button gap!) and lost its softness. i hope the store lets me return it.",0
"The waist is a little high and large, and this causes gapping in the small-of-the-back area. very cute dress, if it fit well. would probably work on someone less curvy. 00p, 5'4'',110lbs,32c for reference.",0
"This is one of the best purchases f
i have made at retailer recently. i got this in ivory in my usual xs. the pictures do not do it justice.  it has such a nice drape and i love the detail on the back.  looks great with black cropped trousers, as well as skinny jeans.",1
I bought this shirt along with a matching vest and duster........love it!,1
"Love this top. it's everything all the previous viewers said....except that the white isn't white but a creamy white.it has a yellow under tone.. this restricts my over all plans,but i still like it.",1
"I really wanted to love the shorts.  when i read that the shorts were lined, i expected them to be lined so that my underwear didn't show.  even though the shorts are lined, you can see through the fabric completely.  this was absolutely disappointing since the shorts have a lovely exterior design; pockets; and, comfortable waistline.  i'm returning the shorts as well.",0
"I have so many compliments on this blouse. i love the style and design. i wear it with my long cotton skirt because it runs a little short since i have a long torso and i am 5""8 tall. i would love to wear it with my skinny pants but then it won't look right in the back kinda hang out. otherwise really nice quality blouse. i would definitely buy another just to have a back up.",1
I tried this in store and fell in love. i'm usually between a 0 and a 2 in tops and took this in a 0 because of how flow and lose this is. the fabric is light and not bulky so it can also be tucked in.,1
"This top is really cute and can be worn off shoulder or not.  the embroidery is really pretty.  my only comment would be the top is shorter than i expected, if you wear it off shoulder its of course longer but still shorter than i would have preferred.  keeping it anyways as it will be a fun going out casual top.",1
"I fell in love with this shirt the moment i saw it!
unfortunately, when i went to put it on, there was a hole running down the seam in the back. i went to store to exchange, wore the shirt, and someone tells me i have two holes in the back of my shirt. horrified, i went home, took a look, both holes along the seam! i will be returning this, i really liked this shirt!",0
"I love good, flowy blouses and like the over sized look, but this one didn't wow me. i thought the quality was just ok. it didn't flatter me. i almost liked it, but i didn't. i'm glad i tried it on, because looking at the pics online i thought i'd like it way more than i did. just not great.",0
"Such pretty pattern and colors, pleased with dress",1
I loved the star pattern of this top but the cut was odd. it is very big in the chest and full at the bottom. for anyone who is petite on top it tends to look sloppy.,0
The quality of this shirt is great and the colors are pretty. it just made me look super wide. i feel like the waist is too high - not quite empire and not quite at the waist. it just wasn't going to work for my body. maybe a different size would work but i don't like it enough to try.,0
"This top was gorgeous and fit perfectly right out of the bag, with only a quick ironing. unfortunately, the first time i washed it (cold water, hang dry), it shrunk so that it no longer fits across the bust without tape where it was once roomy, is much shorter, and feels rougher to the touch. like another reviewer said (unfortunately, after i had purchased and washed!), i wish the label would have just said to dry clean only, because i regret washing it and would have done otherwise if i had kno",0

"The first time i saw this in the store i passed it by because the fabric didn't appeal to me .... but the second time i tried it on and fell in love .... had to have it in the beautiful blue.  i'm busty 32h but wear a small and the gathers do wonders to camouflage, which was a nice surprise, because i usually avoid anything with fullness.  will look great with white or black jeans but i will also pair with a very subtle pattern legging as the length is perfect.  i'm short, 5'3"".  neckline is fem",1
"These are soft and skim the body the way well fitted undergarments should. they do not pinch, bind, or ride up. they coordinate perfectly with the matching bra. i am very pleased with this purchase.",1
"This blouse drapes and floats lightly like a dream. the dark black patterned top is not see-through which means you can easily wear it without having to layer. the length covers past your hips and the pattern is flattering.

the doubled-up buttons makes the blouse unique and it's comfortable enough to wear to work or with jeans from late summer into fall.",1
This shirt is wonderful! i love the styling and the print. sure to be a favorite!,1
"I wore this for a few hours, and while it i got compliments i ended up needing to return it after the seams opened up over the shoulder blades. the fabric is so fine that during the normal goings-about of my day it gave way. and no, i didn't buy too small, and the fabric didn't pull while i was driving or reaching for anything.",0
I absolutely loved this top. it fit great and was easy to dress up or down. i wore it once and washed it according to the tag. cold water and flat dry. it is now 4 sizes too small and unwearable. extremely disgusted.,0
I love this top! the length is just right and i love the flow of it!,1
"Finally a pretty maeve shirt that actually fit my (apparently) giant hulk arms.. but it's so flowy/swingy i had to return it. this might just be a problem with being a larger lady, but the excess fabric made me feel like i was wearing a tent and made me look 10x bigger than i was around my waist/hips, even when balanced out with leggings. i thought about trying to size down but wasn't sure if that would even solve the excess fabric problem and still leave room in the arms. of course i can't try",1
"I love the look of this dress but the length feels a little awkward which might be my height (5'4""). i'm thinking about having it altered, not sure if i will do that or return it. i love the colors and the back cut out, it may be a better length for taller individuals.",0
"I really like how this shirt flows and feels. the details are super cute (double buttons in front, pleats in back). great shirt to transition to fall.",1
I purchased this striped racer tank to wear during the day on july 4th! it was perfect! the back is really special and dresses it up!,1
I've worn this shirt approx 3 times to work. each time someone comments on how much they like it. i'm attempting to add more color to my workwear. this shirt tends to swing so much i feel exposed. that is the biggest drawback.,1
"The fit, once you get it on is as flattering as can be. its beautiful quality is undeniable. the problem and it's a big one...you can't get it on without destroying your nails. the beautiful little buttons running up the bodice are impossible to get done and undone. 'dear designer, you forgot the zipper. sincerely, women everywhere'. i loved it so much but just couldn't buy an outfit that was going to take me 20 minutes to put on and since it is a jumper it would be a process throughout wearing",0
I was so happy to find this in extra small. it is such a cute loose fitting top.. very soft and flowy tank. the orange color is so pretty. i went down a size in this top,1
"This is a swingy shape which means a lot of fabric on the bottom half. so many retailer tops could be maternity wear for this reason, i'm ready for the trend to die out! that said, this print is very pretty and the fabric is great - not sheer for a nice change. i'm returning it because the arm holes are large and my bra shows at the sides. this is a pet peeve of mine. i don't want to wear a cami under a tank. almost a home run, i'm tempted to try one size down but i wouldn't like it shorter so i p",1
"Rompers are my fav so i'm biased writing this review. although they are a little tricky with the fit i definitely can say that this beauty makes my body look amazing! the cut of the fabric makes for a great shape. yes, the first couple of buttons  are tough to get on but i'm guessing that after a couple of wears it will get easier. i got my usual size 4 and it fit like it was made specifically for me. i'm very happy with this purchase.",1
"I really wanted to like this but the fit was just off. it made me look like i was very pregnant and i usually wear loose and flowy tops too. this one was just too much material. i am usually an xs and that was the right size for me. i thought about taking to a seamstress and having some of the material taken in, but decided in the end to return because i just didn't love it. the pink color and the fabric are nice,  though there were several hanging threads too which is why i gave quality a 3.",0
"As others mentioned, you have to unbutton all tiny buttons to put on and off... i do hope this gets easier with use... but - gorgeous and flattering as all get out! :-) i love the design in the back, and the little annoying buttons are sooo cute. the cut is super flattering, and classy. i can wear this to work, or out, just don't drink too much water ladies.... i am 115 lbs and 30dd chest, and the 0 petite was perfect. seriously, beautiful... so torn (keeping it for now!)",1
"This top makes you feel like you should be in the tropics sipping a frosty cocktail. fabric is soft, not too sheer. i'm usually an xs and that's what i kept in this top. armholes not too low as in some. for reference, 5'4"", 123 lbs",1
"I was so curious to see this skirt. it looks just like pic. really gorgeous bold pattern and a faux suede like fabric. my only problem was that i thought there was too much fabric. i love maxi skirts. i am 5&#39;8&quot; and 136 lbs. it was a bit long on me but just had too much fabric. i have slim hips but this made them look larger. skirt is almost ballroom gown like in its fullness. loved it and someone else might love it but for me, it was too much. wish it worked!",0
"This romper fit like a dream!  it is gorgeous, unique, and sexy. i am rating this 2 stars because it took me 20 minutes to try it on!  there is no zipper and the only way to get it on and off is by buttoning and unbuttoning the small buttons on the top. nobody's got time for that!!!!  i wanted so desperately to wear it to my friend's 40th birthday party. but i imagined myself spending half the night in the restroom trying to get this romper on and off. no thank you!  i considered buying the romp",0

"I ordered this in the blue motif and the print is really fun. the orange is even brighter in person. at 5'8"" 130 lbs the small has more than enough room and is a bit longer than some of the other offerings lately.",1
Overall the top is cute . what doesn't show in the photo are the pleats on the shoulder/neck area. the placement of the pleats makes you look like you have a football player neck . the neck area doesn't lay flat but comes off as puffy at your neck. i've never seen pleats placed in such a spot. ruined an otherwise cute top,0
"I purchased the blouse in both the ivory and black. the black i decided to keep because it will go with anything. i was hoping the ivory blouse would work but it's thin and see through. if someone could please tell me where i could find a casual, white or ivory blouse that is not entirely see through i would greatly appreciate it!",0
I purchased the orange version (definitely orange - not red) before heading out on vacation and it was perfect for hot summer weather. the swingy shape keeps you cool and the print is much better in person. the fabric is very soft and hangs well. look forward to wearing to work also with a cardigan. i own a few akemi + akin tops and always get a s. this one seemed a bit large even in s but i liked the length so kept the s.,1

"This jumpsuit is so cute and it looked amazing on. i had to return it because of the poor design. it was extremely hard to put on and take off! there are so many buttons to do and undo which are not as easy as snaps! the fabric buttons definitely make a great look to the jumpsuit but there should be a zipper on the side for easy access, or use snaps instead of the loops for the fabric buttons. what a shame of a lovely and classy design on a good quality material, but not worth it if it's difficu",0
"I was excited to get this shirt in the mail, i liked the pattern a lot, but was so disappointed when i tried it on. i am 5'4"", 130 lbs. and wear a c cup so i tried ordering a small as a starting point. there was enough fabric on the sides to make another shirt! despite the excess fabric, the shirt pulled open in the chest area, making it a complete fail. i'm sure the model in the photo must have the shirt clipped in the back to pull in the excess fabric, especially since she's small on top. ther",0

I agree with all of the reviews. the design and fit are wonderful if you can get it on.! the buttons are a nightmare! whoever made these clesrly sewed the loopholes on the buttons closed with no thought as how to open them or get them off. ridiculous! they need to put a side zipper on this as i will probably check into since i really want to keep it. so so so disappointing,0

I love this tank top - it is perfect for work and dressing up a more casual outfit. the fact that it has small cutouts is cute and doesn't make it so you absolutely have to wear a tank under it in more casual situations. i love the colors and the boxy fit. great purchase!,1
"I was really excited to get this dress, i initially ordered a small (i am a size 4) but when i tried it on, it was really tight. the bodice at the top fit strangely-i had to shorten the straps quite a bit, and the dress just looked off. i love retailer and get all of my dresses from there, and the look of the dress on line was beautiful, but just didn't fit right. i did love the lace look, and would love seeing more dresses with this design.",0

I have a love and hate with fit and fashion. i love super beautiful clothes that are comfortable to wear. normally i am the one everyone keeps asking where did you buy that and i inwardly roll my eyes because my rule of thumb is dress with the most comfortable thing i can. now i'm also a full figured mama. these outfit made me look chic parisian and made my derriere look like it was very attractive. i have a long torso and a long neck and long legs and it hid my flaws. so if you want to look lik,1

"First off, the other reviews are spot on regarding the quality of this top. the material is thick and pleasant feeling, the print is beautiful and the construction is nicely done. however, i just couldn't get past the fit issue, which was also mentioned by the other reviewers. i ordered a 14 for my 38 dd chest, and it was loose in all the wrong places. i'd be interested to see what a 12 looks like on me, but i'm afraid it would be too snug. this may look awesome on someone else, but i had to ret",1

"I took a risk and bought this blouse and got a wonderful surprise. i bought my usual size small (34c, 31"" waist) and it was perfect. the details of this blouse are amazing. you cannot see the flecks of copper-gold leaves all over the fabric or the gold threads running down the seam in the front. it is really, really beautiful. the fabric overall is soft and flowy and the sleeves do not stand out off my shoulders in a weird way. there is a soft flow of ruffle down both sides of the shirt. the fro",1
"This is a beautiful blouse but needs to be returned for size. i have lost a bit of weight; the last couple of blouses i have gotten in a m (including this one) have been to large for me. i am 5'5"" tall, 138 lbs and in this blouse need a s. the fabric is satiny and substantial with a gorgeous lining edged in contrasting thread., it hits at the top of my thigh in a regular size 8 but i should have ordered a 6. i would say to size down if you are close to being between sizes. the colors are as show",0
"This dress is beautiful. it may run a tad large. everything about the dress is very appealing from the nice fabric, beautiful design and colors of the print. it will go straight into fall. so very happy i tried it! i have a beautiful, elegant dress for the hot weather.",1
I was very disappointed with my recent retailer order. i ordered the meleri eyelet tank and it had a stain on the front. i also order a dress that came with a tear in the fabric. sale items should not be damaged unless the customer is aware of the damage and accepts it in that condition. very disappointing.,0
This is a wonderfully-made top. i love the colors! if you are busty you must size up! this fabric doesn't give (stretch) at all.,1
"I have a 36c bust. i bought this blouse in a 10, even though i wear an 8 or 10. i sized up based on previous reviews. this top was super tight in the bust (it literally flattened my breasts) and very loose on the bottom. it was not flattering at all. the material is gorgeous. it is thick. it is lined. it is darted at the bust and it flares out in a peplum fashion where the light fabric up top meets the dark band of fabric in the middle. the problem is that busty ladies will find the bust area wa",0

"So, i want to start off by saying, the quality of this shirt really was great. as was the pattern, unfortunately if you're going off the picture know that they definitely pinned in the sides on the model. this shirt has a full on triangle shape and flares significantly towards the bottom, it's not a straight fit as the picture would suggest. i'm sure this works for some women but if you're muscular with an already v-shape to your body (meaning your shoulders are significantly sized and you have",0
"I was really pulling for this dress to work because it's beautiful, however the neckline is cut so extremely low that i had to return. it's much higher on the model than in real life. the petite length was still far too long, so additional hemming required, otherwise fit was true to size (5'3, 130 lbs, size 6p)",0
"This is a beautiful swim suit! the overall look is lovely; the ruffle is sweet and the low-cut front keeps it just the right amount of sexy for a one piece. i didn't keep it only because i would have preferred the leg opening to be cut a little higher. otherwise, it fit very well. i'm 5'10"" and 150, with broad shoulders and a substantial rack (nursing a baby right now) and i didn't have any problems with support. great buy!",1
"When i saw this, i ordered immediately thinking it was similar to the popular colorblocked stripe sweater from last year. the knit is stretchy and textured and feels like great quality (would wash well), but it's pretty lightweight. the fit is huge...could easily size down. i'm 5'7"" 128# and found the small to be loose everywhere, including the arms. the length was at my knees, and the stripe fell awkwardly across my chest. no idea what i'd wear this with even if it fit better. sadly, it's going",0
"Love this black and white dress. the bottom art print is so nice, i am a sucker for flowers, i also love the cut of it, teh tiered hem is very flatering, not too much amterial. the upper part covers a normal bra, and the whole dress is super flowey, substantial amterial, and stretchy (for those days where you ingest more than itnended). flattering cut (waist being the aame apttern as the bottom, gives it a nice shape). i can't say anything bad about this. 

regular xs fit me but i would ahve t",1
"Beautiful print and a flattering cut. however, the proportions are off. based on other reviews, i ordered a petite (i am 5'4"" and don't normally need a petite cut). i also ordered a size down. even the 0 petite requires that i wear 3-4 inch wedges and pin the top in the back to keep it in place. i am going to take it to a tailor to have the hem shortened and the top sleeves adjusted...then maybe the v neck won't be almost to my belly button.",1
"Loved the material and the style. unfortunately, my fears came true when i received this swimsuit, and there wasn't enough support despite a review i had read. as a 36d, i thought the halter would be enough support, however, the material is too stretchy to rely on that completely. i am sad i won't be keeping this though. the material is heavenly!!!",0
I wouldn't be so unhappy if these pants cost about 75% less. they are so cheaply constructed. one wash and they're all but guaranteed to shrink. the material is so cheap and flimsy not at all what i expect from retailer. they are also 32 inch inseam not 35.5 as stated on the web site which is the whole reason i bought them.,0
"The material is nice and has a lot of stretch. i ordered the small as i'm a 6 in most dresses. it fits comfortably  i could probably get away with xs but have a large chest so was afraid it wouldn't cover me. i'm 5'2"" so a petite might be a bit better but it was sold out. i'll have to wear tall wedges with this one.",1

"I was disappointed in this bordeaux top, a brand i usually enjoy. i ordered a medium, my usual size in their tops. it was very very big and did not fit at all as pictured here. also, the fabric is somewhat sheer and while i tried it on wearing a darker bra, the combo of being way too large and a bit sheer was enough for me to return it.",0
"I think it's a cute dress, but nothing spectacular. that being said, i get a lot of compliments. it's a very flattering cut, but i wish it was more colorful, not just black and white. i'm 5'10, 145 lbs and got the s, i could have probably gotten the xs too, but i'm happy with how the s fits. great length too, since i often have a hard time finding dresses that are long enough for me.",1
"One of the best maxi dresses i have ever found! i needed a dress that could accommodate a large bust (36g) and camouflage my postpartum belly. the dress did it all. i ordered the large (5'7 and 155 lbs) and it is so flattering. it has just the right amount of coverage up top to prevent looking too busty. and the band around the midsection makes me look much slimmer. like i said, best maxi dress ever. price is pretty high, but it was worth it!",1
"I love this dress. i live in maxi dresses versus shorts in the summer and this is the perfect cut, weight and quality. i did have to order it in petite or else i was stepping on the bottom (unless really high heels). i am 5'5"", so i would say that it runs long. offer this cut in more colors!!",1

"Gorgeous dress with a slimming pattern and flattering waistband. i would say the bust cups are a little floppy on the medium petite and i have 36dds. like others, i wish the skirt was lined but it's not a deal breaker. tracy reese did a great job creating movement in the skirt and flounce without the bulk. i can wear a little heel but wearing flats makes the hem drag.",1
"This dress is so much prettier in person - the pattern is unique, adorable and not over-powering. i'm an xxs petite and i can wear the dress with flats. (5ft) i think this is versatile enough to wear to work, party or a casual wedding. the fit is perfect - hugs at the correct spots. the fabric feels really soft and silky and feels a bit heavy which allows it to drape nicely. overall - i love it.",1
These are just as cute as pictured. they are generously sized made from soft denim. the denim has quite a bit of stretch. i ordered a size down from my normal size. i was surprised by all the extra threads in the pockets. they were still attached to the inside of the pockets. it just made them feel a little unfinished. these didn't impact the overall wear or appearance of the garment. the straps are adjustable with two buttons on the overalls and three strap-length adjustments on the straps. the,1
"I didn't have any problems with the fit, i love the puffin pattern, the material is nice---it's just so short. i really haven't decided if the print is worth the awkwardness of the length, or if i'll just keep it and only wear it when it's cool enough outside to wear a tank under it, so i can avoid flashing my stomach every time i lift my arms. but, yeah...it stops right at my waist in front. way too short--stop making these great shirts so short, please.",0
Absolutely beautiful!! quality is worth it...i agree with other review and also sized down from large to medium for a more fitted look ....the color is gorgeous..lighter shade of brown...so thrilled material does not contain dreaded wool lol!,1
"This runs sooo big! i normally wear a large ( 145lb, 5'-4"", 36dd) but due to the limited sizing small or medium i chose small because it looked big on the model and this style of dress seem to run large. the size small that i ordered couldve fit two people easily together! i loved the pattern, color and the slip underneath actually fit well but i dont want to look like im wearing a tent, lol. also, the back is slightly longer than the front, something i couldnt see from the pictures online.",0

I saw this and was hoping to try it so i went to the closest retailer.. the design of this dress is fantastic but if you have curvy hips this is going to cause you problems. i am 32c-24-35... i have a definite curve between my waist and hips and it totally interfered with the line of the dress. i think if you are straighter between your waist and hips or you are long waisted then this lovely dress is for you. the waist line was simply too long. i needed the dress to flare out higher. the to,1

I love these so very much! by far my favorite addition to my wardrobe this summer. i find they are the first thing i grab because i feel wonderful in them. they fit perfect even with a large bust which i was afraid i would not be able to pull off....but very tastefully do. i highly recommend these and i plan to wear them into the fall with boots and long sleeve t-shirt. worth every penny. if your size is available grab them...you will be happy you did.,1
"The skiers, cats, and puffin patterns are adorable and i was very tempted to keep the shirts just for the patterns. unfortunately, the fit was awful. i am short and need to highlight my waist and this shirt did the opposite. the skier fabric is also see-through. the tenting issue could be fixed if you belt the shirt or tuck it in, but it is not very long. 100% rayon fabric is a bummer too. the shirt was snug at the bicep, but not as bad as i expected from the reviews. i sized up from an 8 to 10.",0

I was very excited about this product. when i saw it the pattern was beautiful in the romantic floral and the bottom band looked like the bathing suit was a little longer so i felt it would be good for a large chest. when i received the package i knew instantly it ran small. i tried it on and it barely covered half of my chest. also the band at the bottom is actually very small and not what i expected. the print is just as lovely in person as it is online. i don't even know if sizing up will mak,0

After reading so many great reviews i was sure i was going to love it but i'm so glad i tried it on in the print at the store. the small was baggy in the bust - ti was not slightly fitted as shown in the picture. the extra small was to small in the chest and the seam came up too high. it was also very low cut. the shirt as shown has to be pinned behind the models back because there's no way it would look like that otherwise. if it would have been a little more tailored as shown in the photo i wo,0

"I love(d) this top. it was my go to top even in the heat, the fabric is light and breathes. however, pulled it out of the washing mashing to find that the sleeve has shredded away from the body. it could not be repaired. i am so disappointed as i really loved everything about it.",0
"I am on the fence about this dress. the fabric is gorgeous and soft. however, i was hoping the fit was more slouchy like pictures on the model. it was much shorter on me that pictured (for reference i am 5'7) and the turtle neck part of the dress is kind of high and tight. i wanted to love this so much, but it is a touch off from what i was hoping it was going to be.",0
"While there is nothing wrong with this top, it didn't really have an retailer feel. it looked more like something from a dept store, maybe a boutique. i got on sale but sending back bc i just don't like it that much, especially next to my pale skin. i could see it looking much better in someone with darker skin tone. i'm usually a 8/10 med. small in this top fit well.",0
"I ordered this blouse after it went on sale - i'm not typically the blouse-y type, but i thought i'd try it. for me, and i'm a pretty consistent small across brands, it was quite flowing and a little long, but that may be what someone wants. it was a little light in color to look good on me, but i think this would be really cute with dark skinny jeans - easy to dress up or down :)",1
"I love finding unique retailer pieces that don't require dry cleaning. i was excited to find this shirt, but it's not flattering. the bottom hem is a little tight, which makes the rest of the shirt look bulky. perhaps it would work better on people who have narrow hips. i also didn't like the pink tones when i saw the colors in person. i'll be returning this item.",0
"When i saw this online, i knew i'd have to order it fast--it's just gorgeous. i got it in the mail today and couldn't be happier! i'm usually xs in angel of the north sweaters and this was no exception- it fit great. colors are as pictured.",1
"A mango beauty that resonates the color of blossoms in bloom. comfortable, effortless, and charming. i wear a size small in retailer dresses and this one fit true to size for me. tried the xs since reviews mentioned it ran large, but too tight across my average chest. looks great with denim jacket and red suede strappy sandals. also worn with a belt to accentuate waist.",1
"I ordered a size xl in the mango. the fit on me matches the model for the most part so i think it's true-to-size. it looks like it's intended to have a loose, flowier fit throughout the dress. the only confusing part to me is the model is listed as being 5' 9"" and i'm under 5' 6"" yet the length is the same. it fits me at knee-length too. i thought it would hit a little longer based on the model's info for the photos and getting the regular sizing. the one thing i wish was different is to have it",1
"I so wanted to love this dress! the color and fabrics are beautiful and scream summer! i was so disappointed by the fit through. the different fabrics are such a cool concept but it wasn't executed that well. one material is pleated like an accordion so wants to ""constrict"", the next material is crocheted so is a little more stiff and the third material is pretty average. on the bottom where it's flowy it doesn't make that much of a difference, but on top and in the middle it gives this weird ""i",0
"I get a lot of compliments on this dress, it's bright and cheerful for sure! it runs maybe a bit large but is a great summer dress!",1
"I ordered the petite in my size, since i'm well petite, but curvy. i recommend this dress if you don't have a lot of boobage. unfortunately, for me the waist line came up high an inch below my bra line and made the dress poof out at my hips in an unflattering way. its so pretty and i was really excited about ordering it. it fits, but just is not flattering because of my boobs. this is always my problem though with dresses.",1
"Love this dress!! the vibrant color and lace details are just beautiful. can be dressed up or down. the only concern i have is that the straps are thin and delicate, but i'll just have to be careful when hanging it up.",1
I love this sweater coat;! it's so nice and fits well. would look great with jeans or a skirt. the collar is adorable! have already worn it and received compliments! i love retailer :)!!,1
"I drooled over this dress online, so couldn't pass up trying it on at my local retailer store. while i loved the unique color in person, & the drape of the skirt (good quality, fully lines), i was so disappointed with the top of this dress! it's very tight, ill-fitting, & just plain...weird. i can't imagine the fit of the top being flattering on anyone, regardless of chest size. it's a shame, because otherwise, the dress is adorable!",0
"I found this to fit really well and i've got a chest, and the hourglass to go with it. the stretch really helps it to be comfortable too. i reckon it's pretty versatile too.",1
"This dress is cuter is person than online, but it has one huge issue - there is a teeny tiny button at the neck that is held on by a thread and requires fingers the size of a two year old to get open. it fell off the minute i tried to undo it. i can't believe these other reviewers didn't have the same problem. or, maybe they put a snap there instead. too bad.",0
"I was so disappointed in this top. the fabric blend was too thick for summer. the cut was wide across the shoulders, and very narrow and short through the waist. add in the odd splashes in the print, and it spelled disaster.

size: i tend to run between small and xs. i ordered xs. i'm 5'5"" tall, 135 lbs, 34d, 35-29-37, narrow across shoulders, with short arms and long torso.

fit: the cut was so wide across my narrow shoulders that it looked baggy and felt odd. however, the sleeves didn't sl",0
"I was leery of purchasing this blazer online without any reviews to read...and now i know better. the color and fabric are nice and what you would expect from the photos. the sleeves, however, ran small compared to the body. the shoulders also pulled and felt narrow compared to the torso. the body the opposite...too large and not flattering on an hourglass figure...no darts, no fitted places, nothing making it tailored to fit. open it hung wide with an unflattering silhouette. buttoned, it sprea",0
"Great dress that can be dressed up for work day or even dressed down for a nice weekend day.
i have it in black but thinking of buying in the yellow/orange color too.",1
"I love the color of this dress. it is not flattering, even though it should be. the weird panels of different materials makes it hang super funky. the lace is heavy but the silky panels aren't. so not flattering, it's just odd. and the fit is super huge, you are swimming in it in addition to a poor body drape. it could have been so cute, but was executed so poorly.",0
This is a go with everything throw on sweater coat that is very soft and flattering on. the fit is true to size for a swing coat. being a heather black helps with the no show of lint. i will wear this no doubt for years to come. thanks retailer.!!!,1
"This is a lovely cardigan--especially over dresses with leggings, over-the-knee socks, and boots. i was so ecstatic to get it at the black friday price. the description says its white but it's more like a cream. it was for this reason that i initially reconsidered the purchase. i was hoping for more of an off-white or winter white as it appears on the model. except, it looked so great over dresses and suitable for the southern california winter. i didn't care for the wrap belt. it just looked li",0
"I'm 5'4 with an hourglass shape. i love this dress. it drapes nicely, the material won't be hot for summer and the color is perfect for my olive complexion.",1
"Don't detach the collar unless you like getting frustrated. i made the mistake of taking it off just to see what it looks like without it (cute) but reattaching was the biggest pain! i have pretty nimble fingers but stretching the little loops around the little buttons tested my patience to the limit. so other than that--buy this sweater if you get a chance. it's stylish, flattering, soft, versatile, etc, etc...",1
"This dress is gorgeous on the hanger and even more gorgeous on. definitely runs big though, so sizing down is probably best.",1
"This dress is really cute, but it runs quite large. order a size smaller! i got a lot of compliments on it at the party i wore it to. it can be dressed up or can be casual with a pair of sandles.",1
"I don't understand the negative review
on this sweater. it is nothing short of stunning. the quality and design are absolutely beautiful! and i love the lined pockets! i can honestly say i don't think i'll ever part with it - this is a sweater you hang onto forever. i will say it runs a bit large. i ordered the xs/sm and if i didn't know better i would think its m/l. either way if you can you get your hands on one in store or a return online, do it! it is worth every penny, especially for the s",1
I love the great variety of fabrics and textures used in these joggers - you will also!,1
"Quality is excellent. i agree with another reviewer that the top runs large. i am usually a medium, but i was swimming in it. i live in alaska and would not know how to return it so i am just keeping it and wearing it on those cool lazy days. i'm sure it would still look classy because of the design.",1
"I ordered these hoping they would look like the model - but they didn't. i am small but curvy. it hugged too tightly in the hips so sadly, these pants are going back.",0
"I have a couple of pair of hei hei pants from last summer that i love and was so happy to see these. i am curvy (5'8"" size 8) and got these in a 30 and they fit perfectly in the hips and no gap at the waist. i love them so much that i bought a second pair. the only thing that could make them better is if they had a bit of stretch.",1
"What a let down. the sweater i received in no way resembles the product pictured. based on the original price point, i envisioned a beautiful hand-knitted sweater made of high grade yarn/ wool that i could use for travel. instead, i received something that is grossly oversized for xs/s, made out of weird crafting yarn and looks like an ugly holiday sweater. my kids could make something better than this on their toy loom. not the quality i expected from retailer. back it goes.",0
"Love these pants, they do run small in the hip area and are not stretchy at all. so beware, if you are curvy, you might want to size up. great quality and style overall.",1
I lived the front and back designs but didn't like the fit.,0
"I thought this would be a cute business attire skirt. i hate to say it, but i felt like it flared out as if i were amelia bedelia or some whacky children's book character and not retailer. the fabric made it look bulky. i sadly had to return it.",0
"Love the design of the fabric. i actually bought these in both colors. i gave only 1 star due stitching on the fabric, it's very scratchy.",0
"I have wanted this dress since i first tried it on in april. finally got it as a birthday gift and after looking at it closely there was makeup on the collar. i checked the instructions and it says ""cold water wash"". so i washed only the collar part by hand and every part that got water on it bled!!! looks like the popsicles are melting! i'm so sad because this dress is adorable! i'm buying another in hopes retailer will make this right by taking back the first one. should be dry clean only!",0
"I love the color and design of this suit, however, the rise is too high on my derriã¨re and was not appealing on myself! i am 5'7"" 110 lbs., with a very small bust and a short waist. i think the suit runs very small, as i am a size xs/s in most of retailers clothing. i would recommend it to young lady with a very small derriere and is more petite!",1
"Such a beautiful and unique design - i only wish it fit! it is so, so boxy - i'm thin, but would have needed almost a foot of fabric removed in order to make it look right (and i don't mean making it super tight). the seaming and button details on the back are such that it would be tough to have a tailor refit it appropriately. so, i had to return this, despite really wanting to find a way to make it work.",0
If you have any curves at all then this will look like a sack on you. i wanted to love it because of the material and i've been looking for a blazer/ jacket that was heavy in weight. this just looked awful on me. maybe for someone who is very slender this will work but i was highly disappointed in the cut.,0
"This dress is very cute and well made. unfortunately it was too short waisted for me and runs small in the bust. the arm holes were too big yet the bust small, very weird fit on me. i am six feet tall with 38c bust, maybe if you are shorter with smaller chest this dress will work for you. it has a thin lining and is not see through even though it is white fabric. i love the dress it just wasn't made for my tall figure.",0
"This shirt looks nice on the model, but it felt stiff and unflattering on me. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, and the size 4 fit overall. i just didn't happen to like it on me.",0
"I was so excited to get this classic-looking retailer dress- i love the ladylike shape and whimsical print. the popsicle print on this dress is really, truly adorable. unfortunately, the dress is cut really weird and it made me feel like screaming: i bought a size two and it was snug and gaping at the chest (and i'm only a 32b, ladies, so be warned!) at the same time, the arm holes were huge, i mean massively big. i think if you have a swimmer's body this might work. otherwise, you'll for sure nee",0
"This top is cute, but i found issues with both the fit and the quality. i tried on an xs, but found it to be boxy on my petite frame (5'2"", 110 lbs, 34a). even worse, though, was the feel of this shirt. it's not lined, so you can feel every bit of the beautiful stitching on your skin. it was so itchy, and i only wore it for a minute in the fitting room. it's a pretty shirt, but not worth actually wearing.",0
"The cut is on the boxy side and i'm not sold on the tiered effect, but i love the silk fabric and the print so much that i just don't care. the silk is deliciously light and breathable, and the print is neutral enough that i can pair it with several different cardigans and necklaces to mix it up. and the quality of construction is excellent--all of the seams were expertly sewn and pressed, and the print was lined up like in the online picture. given the material and construction quality, it's de",1
"I love this top, on me, it looks so flattering, the tie detail is really nice, and i love the white subtle details at the bottom and collar. i actually haven't seen the sleeves unrolled on me, i roll them up. the tie part is a little wrinkled from shipment, but who cares. i ordered the regular 0 as the petite have been sold out a longtime ago, i actually got this shirt a while back and thought i had already written a review... i am wearing it with boyfriend jeans right now (for casual friday and",1
"This shirt totally exceeded my expectations -- the detail and colors are wonderful, and the shirt itself is quite comfortable. the shirt is a bit boxy, but there is enough structure and detail so that it looks quite flattering on. plus, it looks great with jeans or with a skirt -- it is very easy to style!",1
"I love the look of this dress on model but sadly, fit didn't work out. very short waisted and tight across chest with very ample arm holes. i'm 5'8"", 155, 34c, reliably a size 10. this dress seemed at least 2 sizes off for me. my daughter, usually a size 2, could wear it except for the arm hole size (and the fact that it's 158 dollars and she's 13....going back.) btw, ""novelty print"" means ""ice cream novelty"", little popsicles with bites taken out - cute but more juvenile than i expected.",0
"I was struggling with the options above-- does it fit true to size or is it too small or too large? it is both too small and too large, which is really strange. the model makes this shirt look stunning, but the product is actually very boxy. i am 5' 3"", weigh 112 lbs and i typically order anywhere from a 00p-0r/xxs-xs. i ordered this shirt in an xsp and the shirt sleeves were short and the middle was boxy. quite frankly, it looked like a maternity shirt and the structure was not worth the money",0
"This shirt is super cute and stylish, but too wide for my liking.",1
I love this top because it is light weight (a must in southern heat). i have a shorter torso so the length didn't bother me but someone with a longer torso may find this top too short.,1
"I love all whimsical prints and shirtdresses and wanted so badly for this to work!  i'm an athletic person with more of a pear shape so a-lines really work for me.  i got my usual size 2 in this dress, and while i felt like the waist was true to size, the top gapped so badly (i'm a 32b) that i had to return the dress.  a tailor probably could have done something to it, but i decided i did not want to mess with the extra expense.  too bad, because the fabric is a lovely weight, the length was per",1
"I waited in anticipation for the turquoise version to appear online. turquoise and red can be found on another product page with the same name. 

size: i'm between small and xs for most retailer brands. i wanted this top to be a bit more fitted, so i ordered an xs. i'm 5' 5"" tall, 135 lbs, 35-29-36, 34d, with long torso and narrow shoulders.

fit: xs is spot on for me. i don't really mind the shorter length. it didn't appear to be too boxy. i layered a white shapewear tank underneath to help w",1
"Everybody else is correct. the dress is adorable but the fit is weird. i am usually a size 2 (134lb, 34 c) but got the 4 based on the reviews. the waist fits perfect, the top is huge, especially the armholes. if i get a size 2 then the waist will be too tight. however, the dress is so cute i am considering taking it for alterations and keeping it. definitely it has fit issues.",1
"Just bought this at the store. just to be safe, i thought i would try it on before ordering just to confirm the size. that was a good idea. ( i am a 38b, 5'9"", and have variable results with trying to order with the size charts.) the large looked nice but was slightly too large in the chest. when directly compared to the medium, it seems the major difference is the length-- the large was > 1"" longer than the medium. i did not find either to be itchy and the construction seems totally ok.",1
"I thought these pants were cute! when i put them on, they fit perfectly, and were comfortable, however i wore them for about 20 minutes and they were a completely different size, and looked awful!",0
"This top is really cute, but the threads underneath the shirt scratch your torso. i suggest wearing a tank underneath to protect your skin.",0
"As others mentioned, the arm holes are a bit large- but i didn't find this too much of a problem. possibly that's because as a smaller chested woman i run into that issue regularly. i'm 5' 4"" 130 and the size 8 fit perfectly. the length is at the top of knee.",1
"Like the previous reviewer, my size 10p gaped and strained the buttons at my chest (36dd wide rib cage 5'3"" 140#). also the skirt flared out too high on my waist. i'm going to try a regular 10 with hope the torso will fit better. other than the fit on my particular body and the one distracting chest pocket, this shirt dress is very well made, very cute",1
"I wanted to give this top some love. i ordered this top and the kota peasant top with plans to only keep one of them. this top is definitely the winner. the neckline, sleeves, pattern, fabric, and length are gorgeous and flattering. it is very feminine and elegant and i think it will also be versatile....it could be very dressy (depending on what you wear it with) but it will also look great with jeans and shorts and sandals. it is a bit sheer so a tank or cami might be needed underneath. i orde",1
"This top is beautiful in person, love the buttons in the back, fits a little boxy but i like that style",1
"I ordered my typical 6 petite and found that the buttons were pulling at the bust ( i'm 34 b) and at the waist. i'm returning and ordering a size 8 petite because i'm a sucker for a shirtdress and a cute novelty print. the quality is nice and the length was perfect for my short 4""11 frame, now only to wait for it to be shipped! oh how i wish petites were available in my local store!",1
"I wanted to love these great spring/summer pants, but sadly, they are just too unflattering for ladies with hips. if you have a ruler build, these pants will be fantastic, but these pants are not forgiving in the hip and thigh area for those of you blessed with a curvier build. i was really hoping for pants that had this clean, vintage inspired, audrey hepburn look re-imagined for the every-girl, because nothing is more flattering to an hourglass body than clean, non-bulky lines (something like",0
"Not sure about this yet. reordered larger size because it hits much higher than shown. belly peeked out from under it! ordered 6 and i'm normally a small/6. like the design but really short.,",1

"I've never had a problem with pilcro jeans. i own several pairs. however, i ordered my regular size 28 (i'm 5'3, 120 pounds) and not only were these jeans thin, they had zero stretch and after 1 hour of wear stretched out horribly. they fit really loose and hung around my knees and legs which is very disappointing for a skinny jean.",0
"This shirt is very comfortable. though it's casual, its uneven seams and asymmetry give it a little
more edge and character. fit is slightly large. i'm 5'5'', 125 lbs and purchased the small. the arms are a little longer than i'd like and the overall fit is slightly too loose. however, it's not a significant enough problem for me to return the shirt.",1
"It's a pretty top with a lot of intricate detail and love the edge the studs give it but it looks fuddy duddy in ivory. looks nicer in black but you loose some of the detail in the dark color. the lace is not soft either but has more of a polyester, slightly scratchy feel. sizing is true to size and it fits well if the style floats your boat.",0
"Too tight in strange ways. beautiful dress i was so excited to receive it, however it just did not fit.",0
"It's too hot here in ca to wear this yet but i can't wait for cooler weather. i tried it on with skinny jeans and it's darling. love how it's much shorter in front with the side splits and long back to cover the bum. perfect for leggings. nice slim, but not tight fit.",1
"I bought this dress as a back-up for my bridal shower and loved it when it arrived. it does run large, so definitely size down. there isn't a lot of shape to the dress, but the quality is high, the color is really vibrant and it's a comfortable fit. i'm 5'5 and it fell to my knees. i paired it with black tights and booties and plan on wearing it the spring with wedges.",1
"I am a big fan of maeve tops. i love the beading and structure of this top. despite the fullness of the design, the fit is flattering",1
Great dress for fall! runs slim through the hips and neckline is a little low.,1
"Love this little ""throw on and feel comfortable all day"" tee shirt",1
"This was a disappointment because beautiful fabrics with interesting design are a rarity--and especially at this length! unfortunately, this is a mess in terms of proportions. if a size 2 can barely get it off, then there is a design flaw. sadly, the fit was so strange that it did not seem that simply sizing up would correct the flaws.",0
It is very sheer which is too bad because the design is super cute.,0
"Pilcro jeans used to be my favorite. in the past 6 months or so, i have bought 3 new pairs, and all have been so disappointing. first of all, the quality is horrible now. in the past, they would last for years and hold up great. my last pair of stet jeans started to visibly wear out within a month. also, pilcro jeans now stink in the most disgusting toxic way. they smell horrible despite washing. what happened, pilcro?!?!?",0
The print and front ruffle are beautiful. the sleeves are awful and poorly represented in the picture of the model. it's almost like the sleeves have a life of their own - so mismatched with this style of blouse. such a beautiful print but so disappointing in shape.,0
"I am a lover of jackets and coats; this is my new fave! 
great color, versatile (i.e. work, weekend). fun accent piece to shield yourself from a brisk wind, while maintaining full fashion status. 
my first day wearing and i've rec'd many compliments. love the combo of trench coat and poncho. my one issue...i wish the sleeve strap actually buckled, it keeps slipping out of the faux buckle and i'm afraid i'm going to lose it. i usually wear a medium/size 10, but medium was sold out, so i ordered",1
"I love the weight of this shirt and the open scoop neck. really flattering ...i wear tanks under my shirts anyway but it is see through. the weight is nice even in heat, and i expect it to be so nice layering in the winter. the cut at the hem is great..... very flattering and does not seem to cling.

i bought a white one, now i have repurchased another white (xs) and a black one. while i was vacillating, theblack xs sold out so i got a small and will cross my fingers that its not too big.",1
"I really loved how this top looked and was really excited it to get it on sale. i was worried that it might be too small/tight (i ordered a m and would consider myself a m) but was relieved to find it fit just fine. i was extremely disappointed to find that it was too sheer to wear by itself and still showed my bra with a layering tank on underneath. it was also more like a crop top for length, which does not work with my mama belly.",0
"What a disappointment and for the price, it's outrageous!",0
This shirt fits great. it is a fun look. i wore it wear a pair of leggings and sneakers for a casual day look. it goes down to my knees in the back and the front is asymmetric. so cute. i think i will get a lot of use out of this going forward.,1
There's a reason the model is holding her arms up in all the frontal views. it hides the very weird wide top part of the sleeve that absolutely destroys and distorts an otherwise beautiful blouse. the print is lovely but the fit is very odd. it's pulls at and is very tight through the bust too. i wear medium or large and ordered size large. if you're less well endowed this might be an okay choice for you. but i have to say this blouse made me look overweight and very wide. returned.,0
"Super cute. cotton is substantial enough not to show bra lines, but light enough to be summery & breezy. i misread ""xs"" and tried it on, thinking it was a medium, & oddly there's barely any difference among the xs, s, and m sizes--the buttons didn't even buckle out across my bust on the smaller sizes--so, this top could be a nice ego boost if you want to size down (i got the m anyway). armholes not too big, ruffle hides any tummy flaws. great with jeans, shorts, and skirts--like a perfect white",1
"Loved the print on this dress, however the fit wasn't for me.  i feel like it exaggerated my belly, and just overall i didn't feel great in it.  the sleeves were also really big.",0
"This white shirt is very thin esp in the front and see through - i would have to wear a cami underneath unless i wanted people to see the outline of my bra. it seems very flimsy and poor quality, even at the sale price. disappointed and will return...",0
"This vest is so cute and a perfect transition piece for fall. it runs a little big. i normally wear an xs, but i had to exchange for an xxs",1
As another reviewer mentioned the quality isn't here.  they pilled in the thighs after wearing once and stretched out so much at the end of the day i was pulling them up constantly.  such a bummer because i love this brand.,0
"The quality is good, as is the design idea, but, practically, it doesn't work. ordered an xs and the top still ballooned out stiffly. this top is not soft or flowy, it is stiff and very wide.",0
"This top is perfect for the first day at clown college if you want to see some clowns cry. the sleeves are probably the worst part of this overpriced monstrosity. the elastic at the cuffs makes the already comically large sleeves billow and puff out even more.

Love this dress. fits true to size!! can be dressed up or down. very flattering1 prettier in person,1
"I love the maeve line and was excited to get this dress. unfortunately, the fit was just bad. the top fit fine but the bottom half was too snug and there were unattractive gaps around the waist and the pockets. don't think another size or tailoring would address the issue. for size, i am 5'4"", 130 and ordered the 6.",0

"I've purchased pilcro jeans in the past and they've held up great. unfortunately, the material used for this particular jean is a far, far cry from what it used to be. the thighs of these jeans start pilling (yes pilling!) after just a few wears. i've never had jeans do this -- whatever denim blend they are using is a complete disaster.

don't buy these -- you will be very disappointed.",0
"I can't rate this with enough stars or numbers! great fit, can't see up the sleeve, perfect length, just right amount of fabric for draping. i am 5'3"" and 130lbs. fits like a dream and when i got it home from the store....it goes with all things in the closet!!! my one reservation is it only comes in one color. let's get on it designers! we need a lipstick red for summer and coral and navy and black and white. i don't need any other top! this one has great cool fabric and you don't need to wear",1
"This top is really beautiful. the color is rich and the texture on the back is a unique touch. and i think it might have worked for me except that i could only find a m/l and it was just too big. i love drapey styles and think this top would have been just the right amount of drapey if i'd been able to snag a smaller size. but the m/l looked like a teal sack, so it's going back.",1
"This is a perfect top for warm weather. and depending on the accessories you pair it with, it can be great to wear while running errands or for a casual date. the woven texture at the back is unique and gives it the retailer vibe we all know and love. definitely runs big but that's part of the charm of the top.",1
"This was my absolute favorite top before it transferred dye onto the driver's seat in my car. >:-( there is nothing in the language of the care tag which advises to wash before wearing because of the possibility of dye transfer to other surfaces. the care instructions say that is is washable with like colors and, in fact, recommends dry cleaning. really? and dry cleaning will remove all of that excess dye? don't think so. after i discovered the dye transfer on my car seat, i washed the top in a",1
"I generally wear a small or medium in tops, and decided to get the medium/large. it's over-sized, but it lays very nicely and doesn't look ""frumpy"". the back of the shirt is exactly as it looks in the picture. the front of the shirt is more of a solid blue than is shown, but still lovely.",1
I am a pretty curvy girl and thought the m/l was gigantic. i returned and was afraid to exchange for the smaller size thinking it would pbly be very large as well. it was not flattering because it was so boxy.,0
This top has too much fabric! i would of liked it more if they had a smaller size but the small seemed like a medium or large!,0
"This tank is not very flattering. there is a lot of fabric, it's very boxy, & the holes kind of remind me of a high school basketball jersey. i even sized down and it's still just wide. i'm returning :(",0
The length in the front is too short and the bottom flares a lot which is really unflattering. i love the top half of the shirt but the bottom half should be more form fitting.,0
It's nice material but the design makes you look like a pregnant lady,0
"I got this shirt in a medium, my normal retailer size and while the short fit, the front is cropped! i am a fan of the tops that are shorter in the front and longer in the back, however this was just too short in the front. my belly button was exposed, and that wasn't the look displayed on the model. unfortunately this top is going back to the store.",0
"The design and colors on this sweater arguably make it a ""statement sweater"". it has a modified raglan type sleeve. i found the sleeves to fit just fine. for reference, i am 5'9"", 150 lbs., 34dddd, and the medium fit perfectly. it is not a long sweater and, with my height, i wear a long tank top or cami underneath. i love the way it looks.",1
"I didn't expect the fit to be as cute, i am not sure i like how the model is wearing this top, but untucked, or more tucked both look more falttering on. the color is more vibrant in person, still light turquoise, but richer. i don't think i nbeed petite in this as it is blousy, but not oversized or boxy.",1
"Also, does run big, though i felt te xs seemed fine (usual size is xs). passed as there were better options, runs big,but mostly, it was scratchy. beautiful color and design, however.",0
This shirt has absolutely no shape. look carefully at the model and you we discover she is cleverly positioned to hide the sheer boxy-ness of this shirt. the print is beautiful but it looks like a maternity shirt. i even ordered the xs at 5'7 and 130 lbs but found it too baggy. returned.,0
I love this top! i originally bought the brown/purple pattern and wore it all the time so when i saw the blue and yellow on sale i had to get it. the fabric is really soft and breezy - perfect for the spring to summer weather. the sleeves are a little long on me but doesn't bother me. it runs a little large but works with my style. i would have sized down but it wouldn't have fit in the bust (i'm a 36d). i definitely recommend this top!,1
The print is very pretty but the fabric is stiff and it runs way too big.  looks great on the model but awful on me.,0
"I wanted to love this sweater. the color is gorgeous, the pattern unusual, it is soft and warm, and would have gone with so many things. but the cut is awful. mainly the sleeves are way too big, making me look misshapen and my arms look huge. the body was a bit boxy but that would have been workable if the arms had been normal. too bad.",0
"This too is easy to wear, skins the body nicely & the color is very pretty. some of the retailer tops have issues for me because i find the necklines too low. not this one. the placket lays flat & doesn't expose excessive cleavage. the details on the blouse are pretty & subtle. the top washed well in the delicate cute. just hang it to dry and it looks great!",1
"Bought this for my daughter in law's birthday. it's just a beautiful, feminine design, well made, nice fabric.. she can wear this for work or for lunch or an evening out. very versatile.",1
I bought this dress in black and i think it will be a great piece to transition with but definitely great during summer. doesn't come down too low on me which is sometimes an issue. the arm holes seem to be on the larger side. i'm 5'3 so it is not this short on me. i'm really happy with this purchase. plus it has pockets!,1
"Wanted to love these pants, they are way, way, too long (i'm 5'4 128lbs for reference). i didn't love the way they looked cuff and didn't think it was worth having them hemmed. loved the color. would work well for someone tall and slim.",0
Love this blouse and stunning color. the ruffles make it special and different!,1
I took this too to the register thinking it was marked down to same price as another tee by the same brand. it wasn't so i ended up paying way too much for a thin tee. will probably return.,0
"This is a lovely dress looks very expensive, nice fabric and detail. i'm 6ft tall 160lb. i normally order a l/10 but got an m color black because other sizes were sold out. length wise the dress is a little shorter than it looks on the model, but then again i'm pretty tall. you can't really tell on the online photo but this dress has a white undergarment, which makes it great because of the see through detail on the fabric. size wise, i felt like even with an m the dress is oversized. it sits we",1
"I ordered the dusty pink color and love it. works well with many colors and tops. i am 5' 6"" and 121 lbs. with an athletic lean body. i do have a butt however and a small waist. i vary between a 26 and 27. ordered both because i could see this was a very slim pant. i could barely get the 26 up over my hips. the 27 fits like a glove, with just the right amount of stretch. i can't see these pants bagging after wear, which is something we all hate. love these pants and i know i will wear them often",1
"I know this is supposed to be a loose, flowy fit which is exactly the style i love. however, this is beyond tent-like. i'm 40 weeks pregnant and i can probably fit two of me in my normal size small. fabric is very thin and pattern looks like drab wallpaper. huge bummer, especially after seeing a few 5-stars.",0
"I saw this dress in the store and loved everything about it. they had an extra large, i usually wear a large, and i thought it would perfect with some leggings. i tried to get the dress over my chest but no chance. my sister who wears a medium tried to put it in too and she couldn't fit it past her chest either. we flipped it inside out and couldn't find a zipper. maybe the dress in the store was mislabeled but the bust ran very small. it's too bad, it looked adorable and i was so excited to try",0
"I bought these cords in navy. the color is beautiful and the fit is great. it is a very slimming fit. i am usually between a 27 and 28, i ordered the 28 and they fit perfectly!",1
This dress is a zillion times cuter in real life. it's very retro-swingy and girlish- it reminds me of something mia farrow would've worn in her rosemary's baby era. i have the black version and i've paired mine with tall black gladiator sandals for a more sultry nighttime look and also flip flops for beachy summer days. i think it's a total steal at the sale price.,1
"First off, the dress quality is great, the fabric is very nice, the color is great. i am 5'4"", 150 lbs. the dress looked like a parachute on me, very unattractive, because the fabric is pretty stiff. i quite honestly looked pregnant.",0
I love this tank. i didn't find it to be see through at all. it runs true to size. it's super comfy and the lace up detail makes it more fun than a plain old tank top. it's a great basic and i love the lilac color.,1
Great fabric and color but fits like a potato sack -- so sad bc i would have loved it,0
"Just got the silver ones in the mail yesterday -- really great fall pants! they are quite a bit more grey than how they look on my computer, so i was a bit surprised, but not unpleasantly.
 i'm one of those people who always has trouble with pants because my thighs are bigger and my waist smaller than usual. i'm 5'6"", 120 with a 26 inch waist and 38 inch hips. i ordered the 28 so my legs could fit inside the pants, but there is quite a bit of gaping at the waist meaning that i cannot go without",1
The dress is extremely high quality! i purchased the dress in black. the white collared shirt that the model is wearing under the dress is not part of the dress. the dress overall is like a balloon. unless you're extremely tall and skinny this dress makes you look bigger! i ordered the small petite and am 125 lbs and 5'4. i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it's going back:( the petite hits 3 inches above the knee for reference.,0
I really wanted to love this everything about this piece. especially after reading all of the great review i was so excited and looking forward to getting this dress. unfortunately it just did not work out. i ordered a large and it fit fine but the dress did not give me the faltering shape i had read about and was hoping for. it literally just hung on me and made me look wider. sadly i had to return this.,0
"This top has a nice design. i love the lace up back which makes it much more adjustable in shape. if you lace it lower it is more flattering to your waist. however the fabric quality is very poor on the white tank. it arrived with a small tear in the front hem area, which i could have easily fixed. it is very sheer; even with a nude bra, my bra was too visible for my comfort. plan on wearing a full camisole underneath, tank, or bralette you are fine with being on display.",0
"I bought two pair in one week...crazy right? i am 5'11 and 150lbs. i bought the pink color, soft faded pink, which drew me to them right away...kinda soft and romantic pink. then two days later went back (one hour drive) and bought the silver which is really a worn in green color. i feel these are true to size, i wouldn't size down because these are""t super stretchy....feels like it also won't bag out during the day. i really love these cords....and the rolled up cuff is adorable.",1
"I only tried on the ivory one, but it was so see-through, there was just no way. i can't speak for the other colors. seemed true to size, maybe a little large, but that's the style. very cute design, loved the back. too bad.",0
"These flares are so soft and comfy they just may become my favorite go to jeans.
i loved the higher rise because they don't feel like they're will fall off like many low cut jeans do.
the material might be the softest jean fabric i have ever owned.
love the braided styling around the pockets.
the bell bottom may be a bit too wide for my liking but the other aspects make that one thing ok.",1
"Love pilcro jeans and really hoped these would work for me. lovely soft material (98% cotton/2%, which you don't see often anymore!), great length, nice medium rise but for me the deal breaker was the lack of belt loops. the braided detail at the waist is a fun design touch, but as someone with a small waist and wider hips, i almost always have to wear a belt with jeans and that's just not possible with these. if you don't usually wear a belt or have a straighter figure, these might work better",1
Even on sale sale...this tank is not worth the money. the design in the back is adorable & would expect it to be so much better quality but the fabric is flimsy(think old man white tanks that come in a pack) completely see through and lack of shape..i wanted to love this but definitely photographed significantly better than actuality!,0
"When i tried these on in the store in my size, but thought they felt tight, but the person helping me pointed out that they hug you, but are not uncomfortable. i uncuff the bottom and wear them full-length. ended up buying one of each color.",1
"I really like this shirt. i almost didn't order it based on the other reviews, but its cute and comfortable! i didn't get the white color, so that may be why mine is not see through. i just wear it with a bra and its good to go!",1
I loved this shirt online but when it came to my house i loved it even more. super comfy and really flattering! i love it!!! runs true to size!,1
"I ordered an xxs and it fit perfectly. i love the simple, yet girly look of this top. the bottom material is delicate and adds a feminine touch. it looks even better in person than in the pictures. the material is very soft and comfortable. looks great with jeans and flats or boots!",1
I loved this top. i paired it with he ag stevie short and jasper and jeera beaded sandals. look was super cute and casual. i love the fact you can adjust the fit in the back with the lace up detailing. flowly tank without the maternity look. i went with the lavender color and it looks great with my olive skin. i had no problem with sheerness when wearing a nude bra. for reference i am 5'6'' 132 lbs and went with the small.,1
I tried on this top in store & was a bit wishy washy on it at first. however i am so glad i bought it and have worn it 3x in a week (shh!). it is incredibly lightweight & breathable which is great for hot texas summers. i also love that it has interesting back detail. the other reviewers mentioned it was see through but i don't agree - i wear a nude bra with it and have no issues. it can be worn casually with shorts or dressed up with white denim & fancier accessories. either way it looks best w,1
"These cords are so soft and snug on- like a hug for your lower half! i appreciate their lack of stretch: they don't seem to ""bag out"" like other cords can. i like that the fabric is soft but the shape is more stiff. the grey is slightly lighter/more silvery in real life than the picture depicts. for ref, i'm 5'2"" and 103lbs and i bought the 24p.",1
"When i received this dress today i was really excited to try it on. it is a pretty dress. looked good in the pictures. however, when i examined it and proceeded to try it on, i was really disappointed. the quality is ok, but not expected for the price paid. and the cut is off. it is extremely small at the top. i am not big by any means( 32d,109lbs, 5'0""). the bottom part fit. sadly, not impressed. this one is going back :(",0
This dress is beautiful. fabric is thin but the details are perfect.,1
"I ordered this skirt because the 4 i tried on in store was huge and the 2 was way too small. the sizing was an issue so i thought i would try another 4. the skirt that arrived by mail was so wrinkled it was obvious that a day of wear would turn it into a nightmare of unflattering creases and stretched out areas. i like the concept of the design with the button front and a-line ""princess"" seams in the front and back, but i just feel the fabric in this skirt has too much stretch. i returned it.",0
I saw this on a mannequin in the store and so wanted it to work but was just too oversized and bulky. very good quality and material.,0
"Cute suit over all. cups are lightly padded, which is nice if you're concerned about modesty. it runs really small in my opinion. i am 5'7"" and 125 lbs. i almost always wear a size small, but i ordered a medium in this suit, and although it fits and i'm sticking with the medium, i'm wondering if a large might fit even better. it's also too tight on the leg openings, in my opinion. i like that the straps are adjustable. the pattern is flattering, and i like the suit well enough to keep it. but i",1
"Uncomfortable in the leg area, but otherwise very flattering.",1
"I had this in my cart for a week before i took the plunge, because i thought it would make the cutest boho statement piece that could go from beach to casual evening outings. i'm 5'9"", so i got the m/l to ensure length. maybe that was wrong? if the ""laid flat width"" was included maybe that would have been more helpful, but this thing was massive and looked like a potato sack. the side slits (of course hidden in the photos) came up to just over my natural waist, enhancing that effect. i loved the",0
"This is going to be my go-to winter sweater for work! this piece is super comfy, yet a bit more dressy than just a regular sweatshirt. it will be an especially great layer for the ups and downs of the office thermostat.",1
I loved the idea behind this shirt but it just hangs around the waist with tons of extra fabric. i suspect the model in the photo has the shirt pinned. totally unflattering making the chest look small and your midsection appear huge. maybe if you size down it would be better- xs was not available for me to try. also the lavender color is really washed out...,0
"This pants are very comfortable, and add a little flare to my typical ""mom pajama"" look. i found them true to size; size small fit my 5'7, 135lbs frame. comfortable to sleep and lounge in!",1
"This a great skirt for someone with a straight or boyish figure. this skirt does not accommodate a curvy figure - small waist, feminine hips.",1
I ordered the large since the med wasn't available and it didn't complement my figure because it was too loose all over. i like the design detail with off-center buttons and the fabric is a nice quality.,0
"This runs way big, i'm a size 8, purchased the medium. it's just big with no shape.",0
"I loved this skirt when i tried it on. the material is soft with a bit of stretch. i'd say this runs a little large. for reference, i'm usually a size 2/4 in retailer and the 2 was still a little large towards the end of the day as it stretched out. 

however, my disappointment was with the buttons.i wore it for a day when all of a sudden the top button popped off. fine, that button is the most used. i sewed it back on myself and even reinforced the top three buttons that i use to take on and of",0
"I was hopeful my size l would fit after another pair of leggings from antrho in this order was too small. these went on easier and i was feeling good until i reached the lower abdomen and everything came to a screeching halt. i'm not sure they are too small, rather, i believe, they are styled to be low-rise. not sure why anyone would want that in a legging, but i'm new to this athletic-wear trend. regardless, i won't be wearing these!",0
"I've never spent this much money on a sweater but took the plunge using the retailer day discount. still painful but hopeful it would be worth it. i ordered the xl hoping to compensate for the shorter length. and it fell just below my hip bones so that part was okay. while this looks like the cashmere is on the thinner side, so the garment flows nicely, it's not. the weight of the sweater is substantial, heavier and much thicker than it looks. the color is different too. it's tan and grey, not whi",0
"I agree with the other reviewer. the colors were fabulous, but it was boxy and fit me like a sack. the slits on the side really detracted from the cute fabric and the hood drooped way in the back due to being able to pull away from the slits. it was really a cute idea and i'm sad it didn't work. i started not to order it based on the first review but i wanted to give it a chance,--i should have listened !",0
I have been looking for a skirt like this and love this one. it does sit a little high on your waist but i like that and think it's more flattering (at least on me it is). i marked that it runs try to size but may run a tiny bit on the larger size. i usually wear a 4 but a 2 fit great and it's been a long time since i've worn a 2!,1
I wish they would have shown this belted as it is beyond striking if you slip you belt thru the top of the slit.under the fabric and bring thru the front belting only the front leaving the back full...stunning and chic! because of the colors this will be incredible in the fall...i plan to wear with all my on trend overalls and booties...madly in love with it. i am certain if all these 1 star reviwes played with it in the fashion they too would have given 5 stars. the knit is beautiful and again,1
"This skirt was placed next to the gallery skirt (corduroy skirt) and i thought it was the same until i touched the fabric and realized it was denim. the material is not the average stiff jean type but much thinner cotton material. i am surprised that this skirt is now released because i feel that it should have belonged to the summer collection. i think it is a nice basic casual skirt if you need one. kudos for the unique buttons, the first button is decorative which stands out from the rest of",1
"Great fabric and design, beautiful pattern with flattering angled bottom hem and fringe. so soft and comfortable.  the hood is cuter left down. perfect transitional piece for fall.  i got the neutral color and it is so easy to wear.  i'm 5'3"" and got the s/xs size and feel that it is still wearable.  i second the opinion one reviewer mentioned about wearing a belt through the slit over the front part. definitely works well and makes for an effortlessly stylish look.",1
"The dresss is much shorter than described. very see thru, though guess you can tell from picture. expected more for the price.",0
"I was so excited about these pants but they were a total disappointment in person. the fabric is a rough gauzy texture. the bottom has a big hem that weighs down the pants and makes them hang funny like you are walking on stilts or something, they do not hang or move well on the body. also, they are very long but small in the waist and have a high crotch so the fit is pretty off. sadly, these are going back.",0
"This dress is made of nice thick stretchy fabric. comfortable on, but fairly tight and body hugging. i liked the fabric, but it was the length that got me. i tired on a 6 - i'm 5'6"" and this dress was just at that awkward length. made me look short and stunted. not a wow piece.",0
"I am 5'3' and 120 lbs for reference, and pear shaped and this dress in a 4 petite fit like a glove. granted, not a dress i would want to gain weight in, but fit perfectly. usually i am a 2 in retailer dresses but read other reviews and definitely made the right choice. it hits at a very flattering length even for someone as short as i am.",1
"I have a booty, and these pants love it. they fit my curves (size 10 with flat abs, but as i said a booty) all while looking professional. at m y husband's insistence i'm buying they grey too.",1
"I was excited to buy this sweater based on the online pictures.  although the ombre coloring is beautiful in person, i did not like the metallic trim at waist & cuffs.  the pictures don't really show the extreme brightness of the trim.  it looks literally like xmas ribbons were sewn into the sweater.  to me it looked like something a child would wear.  i ordered the 1, which was the smallest size offered.  it is oversized without much shape and i felt it added bulk around the middle.",1
"These pants are so cute and comfortable that i ordered each color.  after wearing the black ones one day, they stretched out so badly that i returned the other two colors.  i wish the fabric was thicker with more stretch because the style and cut is really cute. bummer",0
"Gorgeous top, and generous to fuller figures. i meant to order an xl but somehow ended up with the l. was positive i'd have to return it, but it was perfect. went back and bought the white. it's one of those wonderful pieces that feels classy and fun at the same time. very flattering fit.",1
"I had such high hopes for this jacket based on the photo, i even waited for it to come back in stock. the detail is beautiful but it is shapeless and boxy. for reference i ordered xs, and i am usually a 0/2 on top (small chested). it might look better on someone with a larger chest but looked like a sack on me. so disappointing.",0
"I ordered this top in size xl. there is a lot of excess material below the empire waist so it flows out too much. this accentuated my pear-shape and was unflattering. the sizing on the top portion & sleeves was true-to-size. 

the material is so rough, scratchy & uncomfortable. they should have used a softer fabric. the pattern alignment is terrible on the one i received. at $100, i hoped the plaid would have flowed in a continuous, matching line. i didn't notice the mismatched sleeves of the",0
"I really like this shirt. i fell for it after seeing it paired with grey jeans, but when i searched the entire website i couldn't find it. then a couple of days later it appeared. i was super excited and i'm glad i ordered it. i was not disappointed. the shirt is soft and long enough to cover my waist area without riding up if i bent at the waist. the colors are very vibrant and its quite stylish. i ordered a medium and it fit perfectly.",1
"I found that this dress ran very small. i am true 8, ordered a 10 and it was snug",0
"I'm 6 ft tall and usually wear a size 10/12, but had to size up to a 14 because this dress runs a bit small around the waist. it's a beautiful dress. it hit me right below the knee, so might be long on shorter gals. i received many compliments on this dress. the colors are beautiful. the main color of the dress is a dark navy. it looked black online. definitely buy this dress! it's a great work dress and you won't be sorry that you did.",1
"Love this dress! can be dressed down or up for dresser occasions. i did order a petite which i usually don't do but due to the length being so long but the petite is just right hitting a couple inches below the knee. i'm 5'4""",1
"This came in the mail today. i wasn't sure of my size, so i ordered a s & m. i tried on the small first and it fit perfect. i never tried on the medium. fyi, i'm 5'5"", 125 lbs., & 34a in the chest. this jacket is a keeper.
it is so soft & comfortable on; i love olive as it goes with everything; it can be super casual or dressier depending upon what you're wearing. i also like that it is collarless as that better allows for a wrapped scarf. i will use this jacket a lot.",1
"I bought both of these tees and they are perfect under my new fringe denim cloth & stone shirt and dress ....had to have both! the gray tee is so cute has every color of all my pilcro chinos...what a bonus. looks too cute paired with the denim shirts and is a great fall transition. i dressed up the cowboy tee with a chunky green stone necklace. i bought the small and for reference am 5'3"" and 32h bra size and have no pulling so they are tts and only slightly shaped which works perfect for us bus",1
"This is the dress that i have been waiting for all season. perfect color. the material is also ""firm"" without being heavy or thick (if you know what i mean). it lays flat and smooths out any bumps without being overly stiff. the v-neck is also not too deep and the sleeves are not too short. overall, a complete win. now go and make it in gray and navy blue please.",1
"Loved the print/pattern and the light grey.....i think it might have been better if reversed (it has a v in the back, and the front neckline was very intrusive and scratchy to me). i'm normally a small but got this in a medium and it was very short on me. wish it could have worked but returning it.",0
"This is a cute top but it runs pretty big. order a size down. the material is like a thick gauze almost, so i'd definitely wear a tank under.",0
"I didn't receive a jacket. i received a very expensive cardigan sweater with no structural qualities to it. jackets have some structure to them. for example they might nip in at the waist a bit. this cardigan doesn't do that. it hangs in a very boxy shape. the quality is great. very light weight and i really love the little pockets and details, but i don't need/want another cardigan. 

i'm 5'5"", 118 lbs and got a small. the small seemed big, but i think it would have fit fine if it had more st",0
"Loved these in store when i tried them on but was in between sizes so i ordered them in the larger size. boy do i regret that! these stretch out so much i have to wear a belt with them and it gives me this saggy bunchy front when i sit...not attractive. wish i could return them, but i took the tag off and wore them not knowing this before hand!! if in between sizes definitely size down.",0
"Great hopes but a sorry disappointment. at this price, one should be able to expect better pattern alignment as shown on model. the pattern in the garment i received was poorly matched on either side of the button placket. i am 5'6"" and ordered xxs. garment was significantly over-sized. i would have had to order one and probably two sizes smaller to achieve a decent fit. because of the oversizing, the shape is more boxy than it appears in the catalog photo. sadly, this buttondown has to be retur",0
"I just couldn't resist the western scene and it doesn't disappoint. i ordered size large and although it's a bit long for me, it flows nicely over my hips. i had to try it on with several different bottoms and find it looks great with shorts and skinny or boyfriend jeans. just darling under a jean jacket and cardigan too. the fabric isn't thin or heavy. wasn't it goldilicks who said: it's just right! i love the uniqueness of the print that is just edgy and different enough to translate to great,",1
"Looks so cute in the picture, but just didn't really look that flattering on - plus the sleeves were too tight and too long for my short arms so going back....",0
"I have had good luck with cloth and stone and this did not disappoint. i knew i would like it because i have this same top in a long sleeve and sleeveless. it is cute, not too sheer and easy to iron.",1
"I have a countless number of maeve dresses, all size 6. bought an 8 after reading reviews and glad i did. fits perfectly for me one size up. only other issue is the cutout in the back. my bra shows unless i'm very careful.",1
Love this shirt. great shape and lightweight material for hot houston weather. washes up nice but does need some ironing.,1

"What a great little find. it is so soft, and the color blends with everything. a great way to get a few more weeks out of your summer sleeveless dresses, and ease into fall. great with t shirts and pants as well.the collar is flattering over any neckline. it also looks great as a shirt. it really can be worn all year round. i usually wear a size six on top, as ""my girls"" are large. the medium was a perfect fit. and there was no billowing in the back. worth the price, as it will become a go to ja",1
"Not sure i'm keeping this. i love it but it's short in the waist (i'm 5'7"") and very tight in the top. i'm on the small side of a size 8 normally. a 6 sometimes, but the 8 in this is very tight. i do have broad shoulders but am thin at 126 pounds. so not sure if it's just me or if the dress is truly smallish. it is lovely and i want to keep it. will try it on again tomorrow and decide. if you are on the large end of any size, do size up.",1
"I really wanted this to work. the embroidery detail is very pretty. however, the inside of the sweatshirt is a bit scratchy from the embroidery so i would recommend wearing a cami or tank. the sweatshirt is also on the short size. the small hit the top of my jean waist. in the end, i decided to return it:(",0
"This dress is so flattering, not the usual type of dress i go for, but decided on a whim to try and am glad so glad i did. the material has enough heft to give you a beautiful silhouette without being too clingy. you can dress up or down, if you don;t like showing too much cleavage you may want to put a tank underneath to give you a little coverage.",1
"This is a great lightweight jacket. i really like the olive color as it goes with so many things. it can be worn with dresses or skirts which is what i mainly wear. i'm an anti-pant person. the only downside is the price. it's a nice stylish jacket, but not sure it warrants the high price tag. it also doesn't look to great buttoned up; has to be worn open. i do recommend it though.",1
I bought a similar top by same manufacturer in fall in xs. this time it ran huge and had to order xxs which fit fine. it's very cute on.,1
"Nice dress, you can wash it, i got black in med. i am 8-10 in tops and it is perfect, 
brand new is beautiful not sure how it will look after wash. great design. i wish it would be lighter material. 
material is very thick and heavy for a short sleeve dress. probably will stretch when you sit in car driving. 
i will be returning it for that reason, too heavy for summer .",1
I love these pants. bought them in both black and burgundy. but the burgundy pair split in the butt before i even made it to work in the morning. they weren't even tight. so disappointing. i will be returning them.,0
"Cute sweatshirt with fun print. i bought it using retailer discount, and probably would not have paid full price for it. embroidery is a nice touch. i ordered an xs, which fits fine, but the overall design of the shirt is a little short and boxy. i did not realize until it arrived that the back of the shirt is a v neck. it's not a deep v, but it feels a little odd at first.",1
"This is a cute top but unfortunately when i washed it (delicate, cold water, line dry) it shrunk excessively in length. i'm very disappointed.",0
"This top fit nicely and was tts, but the pattern was different than i expected. i thought it would be more of a desert scene and it turns out there are cowboys on it and it just didn't fit my style. if there were cowgirls on it i would have kept it.",1
"This top is very interesting, has delicate knitting pattern, feels very soft but also very thin. i ordered a purple size large, and it was true to size, but a little shorter in the body than looks, sleeves are long just as other reviewers have mentioned. i am 6ft tall, 160lb and i have long torso & curvy body, so this sweater turned out to be shorter than i hoped but with all that underneath layering it could be manageable. overall look of the sweater is about the same as the photo, the only mat",1
I love this sweater. the green is soft. the fabric is light enough for year round in my area. i thought it might be too young but it works nicely for me. i bought it in two other colors when the package arrived today.,1
I thought the sweater was pricey until i saw it on me. this sweater is really flattering! i chose the grey colored one. i'm smaller on top and this sweater is perfect with the v neck cut out the fabric is also really soft.,1
"I loved how this jacket looked online and decided to order it. however, sizing can sometimes be tricky for me so i ordered both a petite xs and petite xxs (i'm 5'1"", 113 lb, and a bra size 32 c). i tired on the xxs first and was swimming in it! so naturally i thought the xs would be even bigger; but to my surprise the xs fit way more snug! in the end, i still didn't like how loose the xs fit so i returned them both. the material is great quality and it's a cute design. i would recommend trying t",1
"This sweater is very lightweight with the loose knit, but is much warmer than i was expecting. the periwinkle color is gorgeous. the chiffon hem provides a cute detail and it is true to size for a loose fit",1
"I loved this jacket! it's exactly what i was looking for. i set out to find a lightweight sweater or jacket that would keep me warm and also versatile enough to wear with different outfits. this definitely fit the bill! in addition, it's really soft and not at all itchy, which was a concern i had since it was wool and i ordered it online. i have received a bunch of compliments! i definitely recommend it!",1
"I ordered the orange in size xl. the fit on me matches the model other than being a little shorter in length.

the quality is bad. i ordered two of these sweaters and both arrived, new in the packages, with one having a small hole. the knit is so thin, as is the base material. the arms are basically see-through. it doesn't offer any warmth because of the thinness. i layered a long-sleeved white tee underneath which helped. the edge of the sleeves stretched out within an hour. i also had two area",0
"This runs a bit on the large side. i ordered my usual m and had room to spare. the green color was lovely, but between the fit and the scratchy fabric, this is headed back. too bad!",0
"Dare i say, this is my favorite pair of pilcro legging cords yet. the pattern is beautiful, with green, black, and grey. the fit is as usual stellar and comfortable. the best yet!",1
"I was on the lookout for a denim jacket when i found this beauty on line. i fell in love immediately and didn't think twice about paying full price. i wear it with moss green chinos and it looks really good. the little dots in the jacket are actually a pale green, which gives it extra character. very well made. i was a bit skeptical about the hook and eye fastenings, but they are very secure. 

i ordered my usual xl and found it roomy enough in the bust and arms. i would definitely call it tru",1
I was on a mission at retailer to find a versatile and comfortable jacket/cardigan. this is perfection. the detail and pattern in the wool make it unique and the zipper and snaps are great quality. i bought it in the green and is great for the office and out in jeans as well.,1
"This is a great fitting jacket. the style, etc.
i got this in the grey - i would have exchanged it for the green (but have a similar color that i bought last year from retailer.
so i ended up returning it - only because i didn't like the color on me.",1
"1.) if you look at the 4th photo of the grey shirt and zoom in you can get an accurate view of the back: this shirt is attached in not one, but two places in the back (in the photos of the black shirt it looks like it is only attached, or ""knotted"" in one place, and that is not the case). disappointing.

2.) unless you want to wear this as an off-the-shoulder shirt with a strapless bra size down. caveat: sizing down will become problematic though for those with large arms as the sle",0
So sure from the online shop & images that i ordered two pairs. the package arrived in less than 2 days and immediately i could see how the cords were everything i expected them to be. so incredibly soft and body forming and has a classic cord texture only softer. i love them ! this look works both daytime as well as evening - it's geared to work with any casual to couture look. my 22 year old niece wanted to buy the second pair (sz 28) from me so i gave them to her. she's a nice niece : ),1
"1. i like a shorter jacket, but this one was poorly made and poorly fit.

2. the sleeves were way too tight. i'm a size 10 or 12, and the large which would be a 14 had tight sleeves that wrinkled up my arms, and the hem of the sleeve turned inside out.

3. i ordered both a medium (size 10) and a large (size 14) , and neither hung right. the m too tight, and the large too loose in the body and too tight in the sleeves.

4. very polyester with lots of static.

5. cute idea, but not very good in pe",0
"This top is comfortable and pretty plus, i like the extra length in the sleeves. it is very lightweight and i'm cold natured so, i wear a bra top tankini underneath for warmth.",1
"This caftan is very light and well-made. i love the colors and designs on this fabric. i was worried that it might make me look boxy, but it accentuates my figure surprisingly well. the fabric is so soft!!! i'm amazed at the price because this is a really beautiful cover-up.",1
"I ordered the white in 0p (i wanted red, but was sold out and don't have a white one so thought why not). i really liked the fit, flirty, flattering, very nice (love the crossed straps in the back). as someone mentioned, the fabric is a bit heavy for summer, but since i spend a lot of time indoors in a cold environment, no biggie, i probably will have a seater on top of it too. the cut is flattering, chest area not too snug, and i can wear a strapless (more comfortable for me). 115 lbs, 26.5 in",1
"I had high hopes for this dress but my husband said i looked pregnant and that i was wearing a tablecloth- and he was right! i'm usually a size 10 so perhaps this would look good on a talk lanky person with a very long torso... but probably not. way too much fabric around the midsection. it's a shame because the fabric was really pretty, but too stiff a hand to drape well.",0
"I found this in-store when looking for a dressy, slightly boho dress for an upcoming wedding. i'm really happy with it -- the a-line cut disguises some recently gained extra pounds but it doesn't feel like i'm hiding in a muumuu because the shoulders and chest are relatively fitted. the flowy hemline offsets the short length (maybe 4-5"" above the knee for me). the pink color is very light -- lighter than in the photos, i think -- but it will work nicely for the wedding. as the first reviewer sai",1
Love this dress! it is so comfortable and can be worn as casual or dress up.,1
"I first spotted this on an retailer employee, she paired it with a peasant top & wore it open w/jeans & boots- so darn cute. love how this peice transitions from summer to fall. i'm 5'4"" so i had to order the small petite which is perfect. note that this dress is very long! it's just a must have garment. the colors/ print are just beautiful.",1
I bought this in navy and love the multi textures and look. i'm happy it was on sale because it is so cute but i would not have paid full price on it. it runs small. i plan on wearing it for casual errand days.,0
I bought this tee in purple. went back the next day and purchased the peach! this is a classic tee with a girly twist! cute with jeans and a jean jacket!,1
I love this duster. it's really different and interesting. i wear it with the dress in the picture but i have the green dress.,1
"I ordered this online and was disappointed with the fit when it arrived. i ordered the xs and it was still oversize to the point of being unflattering. i am tall 5'9"" about 130 pounds and have a fairly thin torso and look best in cloths that have some shape. if you like a loose fit this might be for you. the material is thicker and warm and comfortable. i would suggest ordering down a size.",0
"I was so excited about this top, super cute and fit perfectly but as soon as i washed it (cold, hand wash, air dry) it shrunk! now it is too short and tight. i did not expect the material to shrink so very disappointed.",0
I bought this shirt in a size small. it fits the same as it does on the model. it's a comfortable cute shirt. wish the other colors were available because i'd order another one.,1
"This top was very pretty when i got it, but i was hoping it would be a bit longer. the v neck design was nice, and the fabric very soft. i liked that a simple t shirt was so feminine.",1
"I bought this top in the blue motif and loved it so so very much until i washed it. it came out of the wash (delicate/cold cycle) with 3 small holes. i am devastated because it was destined to be my favorite top for summer. it is flattering, lightweight, gorgeous color, cool raw edges, v-back detail...i could go on and on about all the things i love about this top, but now it has holes after one washing so it's all for naught. do-over please with better fabric qa.",0
"Cute print on both sides, but far more ""cheek"" was exposed than i anticipated from the photos. the front isn't too skimpy, but the back is a bit too small for my taste. definitely narrower in the back than a standard bikini cut. too bad :( the matching top is my favorite top, so i guess i'll just have to wear black bottoms with it.",0
"Love the idea of this but it ran short and boxier than i would have liked. material is soft, cute design but not flattering. returning",0
"Just beautiful! the details and the colors are combined in such an usual and chic way. the fit is really comfortable too--i found that the jacket runs tts, maybe even a bit large, but i purchased my regular size so that i could wear layers. keep in mind, i have a rather large bust, so someone with a smaller one could probably size down. please note, there are no closures in the front of the jacket, but it looks almost closed when you're wearing it.",1
"I purchased this shirt with the purple colored flowers. while the cut is fine, the quality of the fabric is not great so the shirt is very see-through. will be returning it.",0
"Wish i'd noticed that the sleeve cuff and hem were 'cut' to look hippie-casual. i'm taking this back with great regret. it's soft and the prettiest pale lime-sherbet color; made for a cool summer look. i don't like 'tattered,' though - so back it goes. sigh. it's soft, true fit, and beautiful. i'd buy it in many colors and in the lovely lavender print if it wasn't for the 'cuts.'",1
"This t-shirt is very casual, so it is perfect for everyday use. 
touch of textile is comfortable, so i feel relaxed whenever wearing this t-shirt. 
although stripe is a simple design, it does not limit your choise of fashion, so it can go with almost anything. 
just be aware that this t-shirt runs a little larger than the true size.",1
"This dress is happy! it is easy to wear and it is lined. it came in the mail super wrinkled tho. i went for the color more than the style and while the style is lovely, i fell in love with another retailer dress in the same color so i may return this.",1
"This shirt aesthetically is very pleasing. i love the overall design and colors. however, when i tried it on i was immediately itchy! the material is not soft like a cozy sweater ought to be. in addition, though i ordered a size medium, it fit very large - almost too oversized. the sleeves were extremely long on me and the overall body was too big. it's too bad, i really loved the look but i'm not the type to layer. if you are, go for it, but get a size smaller than you normally would!",0
"This dress was overall cute, but you have to have an olive/darker complexion or a nice tan to really pull it off because it is such a pale pink. i'm very fare, but normally can do light punks, but this one just clashed. it does run pretty true to size. if you're on the edge between a smaller or bigger size, i recommend the smaller size however. hope this helps y'all!",1
This is the perfect holiday dress. my best purchase of the season!,1
"I love this dress because it is amazingly feminine and easy to wear. i put this dress on and immediately felt elegant, sophisticated, and flirty all at the same time. a few tailoring uniquenesses i want to mention; stretchy, form fitting, sexy sheer upper and front back panel, you can wear a bra and not see it thru the sheer front and back portions of the dress, the waist is exactly tailored to show off back side. it is true to size.",1
"When i saw this jacket in store, i fell in love with it. the colors with the quilting and gold studs are gorgeous. i am 5'3"" 130# 36dd with petite frame. i tried a m on in store and the sleeves were super long and wide. the s was too small across chest and hung open oddly. the jacket is a nice heavy weight and great quality. i ordered a petite m and it was no better. i literally looked like a big marshmallow...a linebacker! the sleeves were so unflattering where it looked like i was wearing pvc",0
"Just a warning, the yoke on this dress has sequins underneath. i'm not a sparkle kinda gal, so as soon as i saw that, the dress went right back in the package and will be going back to the store. i wish that had been described or more evident in the pictures, to me, it cheapens the whole dress, which would otherwise be adorable.",0
"This top is true to size, although i am a little nervous about washing it... hopefully it won't shrink. it is super think so great for hot days but because it's so thin, i'll be careful. i have white and am def. going to get more colors. i am 5'8'' 128lbs and purchased a small. i think medium might cut to low in the v, but haven't tried it yet, let's just say if it shrinks after washing i will get a medium...",1

it's soft, pretty and covers my wide bottom well.",1
"Absolutely gorgeous.  i never have been a yellow person but today i am converted.  all the colors are vibrant and true to the photo. i'm 5'6 and the length is perfect for flat sandals and my wedges, so i can dress it up or be stunningly casual.  i range from 14-16/ l-xl in retailer dresses.  the size is dictated by my broad shoulders. since this one is sleeveless i went with the large and it's perfect.  the nude slip has clasps to keep the straps in place and its adjustable. the slip is als",1
"Ordered this top in navy with white irregular dots since it was not available in smaller sizes in the store. i took a chance and ordered an xs and the size and fit are perfect! love the scalloped edge, small side slits and the crocheted detail on the top. great addition to my florida wardrobe!",1
"This jacket looks like such the statement piece online with the soft focus lens, but in reality...meh. i think the pattern is gorgeous and would have worked without the studs. and the studs are unique and would have worked on a simple solid color. but put them together and you have the unwanted love child of a laura ashley bag and a marching band jacket. to me, it all felt more cloying than clever.

the quilted fabric and boxy cut of the jacket also makes it unwieldy and uncomfortable. since i",0

"Gorgeous with that retailer uniqueness.

unfortunately this shade of yellow just wasn't right for me.

but it is a beautiful dress",1
Couldn't wait for this sweater to arrive. i love oversized sweaters for the fall! unfortunately this sweater is extremely itchy that it has to be returned :(,0
"Beautiful dress. the color in person in a rich golden sun, not too flashy. a very warm hue, it will compliment every skin tone. it is more fitted than most peasant dresses. not as much flowing material, very flattering. the slight beading on the yoke makes it a standout. very well made, with a nice cotton lining. i am usually a size six in a dress, and the small fit beautifully, even with my large top. it is a stunner, that can be worn with boots or sandals. you will receive a lot of compliments",1
"I got this in light green and it's a gorgeous color. first tried a small, but it was a little too wide and long. exchanged for xs, looks great. now i just hope it doesn't shrink too much!",1
"I tried this shirt in the purple motif, it fit true to size, my normal small worked well. all was good on the front turned around to admire the slight detail of the neckline in the back and all i could see with the red thread the designer used to sew their tag in. really? on a white shirt? it annoyed me so much i didn't buy the shirt.",0
"I've had a lot of misses from retailer lately. i've loved this dress since i first saw it in the spring/summer releases and gave it a try when it went on sale. when it arrived i literally lol. it's an ill fitting nightgown. the size small was a tent on me and it's so flimsy and sheer it probably shouldn't be worn in public. there's a short sheer slip that comes with it but unfortunately doesn't do much. pass, ladies.",0
"I have been looking for a nice white top to go with many of my skirts for summer, and this is not it. like others, it's just so thin and sheer. i live in the south. i don't need my bra showing and i was wearing a nude bra when i tried this on and you can see everything. this is fine to layer in cooler temps, but now in our horrible summers where that's the last thing i wish to do.

- the only plus i can tell you is it's tts and the fabric is so comfortable and feels great on the skin. however,",0
This dress is beautiful and flowy but flattering. the colors are vibrant. the slip is tighter than the dress but i don't mind. it is a half slip and the bottom is sheer. i'm normally a 10/12 in dress and the 12 fit well. the length was good for my 5'9 height.,1
Was looking for the perfect birthday dress....and i found it! gorgeous! i generally wear a size 0 or 2 but opted for a size 4 to give some wiggle room and it still fit me like a glove.,1
"I tried both the xs and s in the store. i am usually an xs, but ended up buying the s, because the xs was really short and i didn't want it to be any shorter after washing. the s fit more like a normal t-shirt, although the back is longer. love the color (blue) and the fabric is super soft. also happy that it's not too thin, nor see-through.",1
"This jacket is extremely good quality, has gorgeous detailing and is warm! quilting makes it thicker than expected, but plan to wear as both a blazer and fall jacket. highly recommend.",1
"Ok ladies....you need to know that this type of fabric is the one that will get holes (i bought the white one). it is super thin and lovely, but i was only able to get two wears out of it. i did wash it and it maintained it's size because i restretched it while wet then hung to dry. i was super disappointed about the wear but appreciated being able to return it without question at my local retailer.",0
"I noticed a xxs p at the store. i thought they would never fit me since i am an xs, but i decided to try for fun and to my surprise they fit perfectly. i love it! very stylish and flattering.",1
Great basic but with a little something special to it. great t all around!,1
"The jacket is cute, it runs small but looks good. i like it even though it feels tight on my arms.",1
"These are perfect with a long tunic for the weekend to run errands! they are not tights-like in the sense that there's full coverage across your bum -- no accidental flashing of anyone. they're not itchy either. i bought these in brown, and want to buy the rest of the colors available!",1
This romper was cute and short but not too short. the fabric is soft and elegant.,1
"I love the design of this sweater and ordered it online, but was disappointed with the quality of the yarn when it arrived. also the color was a little different than i expected from the photo, still a type of ivory, but a little yellow-y. the sweater was solid looking, but the yarn seemed a bit cheap and i'm not sure how well it would have worn over time. flattering cut. i liked how it fit, but for the price and fabric, i decided to return it. unfortunate to lose money on shipping.",0
"I loved the look of this sweater, but the workmanship was surprisingly poor. there were missed stitches, and loose threads throughout, and even a tag sewn to the outside. retailer was great about the return. i really wanted to keep it and was very disappointed.",0
"Love this romper! very impressed that even though the material is ivory colour, it's not sheer and undergarments won't show through. a forgiving fit for everyone",1
"And flattering! i love the feel of the dress, it is flowy, loose but still flattering. i can't wait to wear it with boots. i could go with flats for summer, too, if i wanted to. i have had this dress in my wish list, then i deleted it, but it was in the store as a return in xxs p so i thought, why not! i shouldn't have really, coz now i have to get it... and i did.

colors are actually great, i don't know why people have issues ""matching"" - black or navy are equally neutral in my books...

"I debated for awhile about getting this dress. being tall i was worried that it would be really short on me, so i ended up ordering it in a large (i'm 5'10"" a size 10/12.) it definitely has a blousey look to it which i like. i kind of wish i had ordered it in a medium as well, but i think the large will work just fine. the length is good (hits right above my knee), the elastic waistband is nice because i can pull it up around my natural waist or pull it down for more of a drop waist effect. as o",1
"I ordered these jeans twice because i love them. the first pair were mis-marked by about 4 sizes so i re-ordered. second pair still didn't fit, they run really small, i would probably need one maybe two sizes larger than normal to achieve the fit and feel of the other skinny jeans in my closet:(",0
"I'm a b-cup who hates traditional underwire bras, so i was excited to try this one out. while i appreciate that this bra has more structure and support than other wireless comfy bras, the cups provided too much coverage for my style. if you want to wear a shirt with a wide neck, or do a cute off-the-shoulder thing with your shirt, the top of the cup shows. bummer!",0
"I was excited to receive this dress because it seemed like a beautiful, breezy dress for summer. unfortunately i didn't find the fit to be very flattering. as two other reviewers mentioned there is too much fabric creating an odd bunching especially at the back waistline. i also found the dress to be a little tight across the bustline, upper arms and shoulders. the bunching can be improved by pulling the fabric of the dress forward in the front but this creates more of a plunging neckline than i",0

"The dress has a partially sewn-in slip, which really didn't work for me. no matter how much adjusting i did i couldn't get the slip and dress to sit properly.

Easy to wear dress that looks polished and professional for work.,1
"I wanted to love this dress as it seemed perfect for spring and summer, but it just didn't work for me. it made me feel a bit frumpy, honestly. i purchased the neutral color. maybe the ""red"" would have been less... grandmotherly. something about the elastic waist just didn't work for me either. i tried this with boots, booties, heels, clogs, flats, sandals and i just couldn't make this dress work. sadly sending this one back. i'm 5'7"", 140 lbs and tried the medium.",0

"Even following the care label exactly, it shrunk ~3 inches in the length and overall in the diameter. i had to return this since i am tall and it looked more like a work-inappropriate mini after the first wash.",0
This dress is very beautiful - great fabric and colors - but it looked terrible on me because i have large breasts. i am 32dd and this dress made me look pregnant. if you have the right body type it would be a great breezy summer dress. i'm sad because i can't wear it:(,0
I like the idea of this but had to return it. the fitted liner is attached at shoulders and awkward to get into. the shirt is too poofy. didn't flatter short and curvy.,0
"I bought this in the neutral motif and my expectations before trying it on weren't high but i was sold once i was in the dress. sometimes dresses that have the elastic band in the waist can be tricky if you don't have a perfectly flat tummy and can accentuate the tiniest bump. however, this dress sits perfectly on the waist and is actually super slimming. i wasn't 100% sold on the pattern or color (i wish it was more off white than brown) but the fit was so great that i had to buy it! the dress",1
"Ordered this in the neutral motif, size large and it's a great little dress. comfortable and cute, but modest enough that i'm not worried about my bust (38d) hanging out too much. the v-neck hits at the perfect spot. the sleeves are the perfect 3/4 length, not too tight and it's not too short on me (5'9""). i'm a light blonde and i don't feel washed out in this. it hides a little belly well without being a tent. also, the lining is super soft and flexible. the only problem is the upper back falls",1
"I love how this dress is photographed, but when it arrived to my doorstep i was highly disappointed. there seems to be no shape to it whatsoever. the fabric is much stiffer than i was expected i thought it was going to be more like a sweater dress, but it is not an overly comfortable fabric and it does not move like i thought it would when i put it on. this one is going back.",0

words can't describe the beauty of this dress!
i hope they will restock it cause i would order size s (didn't know how it runs).",1
This shirt runs extremely large. looks boxy and unflattering.,0
"I found this to be a comfortable, stylish, no-fuss look. bought my normal size 4 (5'7"", 128#) in the orange, and it fits like the model. it's a nice lightweight linen and is machine washable, which is always a plus. you can't tell from the photo, but the lace-up portion actually has a bit of fabric in it, so you aren't revealed if it isn't tightly laced ;)",1
I agree with the other reviewers about sizing down in this tee. the colors are beautiful and design lovely. i love how the sleeves are finished and the neckline. i purchased at my local retailer store along with the flower days tee (that i purchased in a larger size because of the differences in the design of the two shirts). highly recommend both!,1
"I saw the shirt at my local retailer store and loved the color and print; however, the shirt had way too much fabric!  i was swimming in it.  it was not flattering whatsoever.  plus, it's overpriced for a shirt.  i'm sadly returning it.",0
I really liked this top when i saw it online. i went to the store to check the sizes. i am a small or a medium. i tried on the s and the xs. even the xs was huge. unfortunately the xxs is sold out. i don't understand the sizing on this at all. it's a shame because the top itself is very pretty. just be sure you try it on before purchasing.,0
"When i first saw this i thought it was a bit boxy but i was drawn to the colors. the arm-holes are a little large and i got an xs (normally wear a size 2), so i will probably wear a tank underneath, but overall the fit is relaxed and comfortable. i love the colors. it has a little longer length (i'm 5'5""). i see this being cute with white jeans, blue jeans. love it!",1

This is a nice top but it runs very large. the small was still too large for me. hoping they have this in xs.,1

"I was looking forward to receiving this dress. i am tired of all of the swing dresses - most of which are not flattering on my petite frame. i am also uncomfortable with dresses that fall much above the knee as i am somewhat older. the colors and fabric of this dress are beautiful. vibrant, but not too bright. when i got it on i was thrilled with the fit - until i looked at the back. there are pleats at the waist in back and there is way too much fabric. it looked like i had a bustle under the d",0
"The top is made well and has a strap holder to keep your bra hidden which is always a nice feature. however the amount of fabric made it unflattering on me. the overall design is fun and i probably would have purchased if it had been more fitted and flattering. i have a medium on in the photo, my measurements are 38-30-40.",0
"This top is gorgeous in person, but when i tried it on, i fell out of love. it didn't happen immediately, but the more i wore it around the fitting room area, the less i appreciated its beauty. i tried it on in an xs - i typically wear a s or xs in most retailer tops - 5'8"", 140 lbs for reference. this top is just huge in the body! the fit is very boxy and just not flattering. yes, it could be cute with skinny jeans and perfect for preggo's! this was just a miss for me.",0
"I bought the white tee. while the print is nice, the size is a bit too large with the xs looking relatively baggy (i am around medium weight and very short).",0
"Loved this dress until i tried it on! it was too big in the body and tight on top in the arm area. from the reviews already posted stating the guy was great, i'm wondering if i just received a defective dress? i also wish the dress were a truer orange/mango color instead of a burnt orange since this dress is for spring/summer.",0
"I love shift dresses and i love t linen so this one was a must for me. i had it in my inbox as soon as it came out on the website and then i found it in the store and had to try it on. i took the six and the eight to the fitting room because i run in between, and the six fit better so i guess it runs a little bit large. really it just depends on how you want it to fit. the length is great too, about 3 inches above my knee, i'm 5 foot 5, which is exactly where i like my dresses to hit. i got the",1
"This is why i shop at retailer. i was in one of my local stores recently, mainly to check out the sale. my boyfriend was with me. we hadn't been in the store 5 minutes when we passed a table with piles of folded tees. this one caught my eye. the color, omg! and then flowers and butterflies! try it on, he said, as i held one up. no..... i shouldn't. we wandered around, checked out the sale and all the new. and i was back at that table looking at that tee. so, i took a small and an xs to the fitting",1
"I didn't realize the patterned material was tee shirt material. i got lots of compliments on it though. i'ts blowsey from the bust down (i got the short sleeved red one) but it's comfortable without looking sloppy. if you can pull off the tucked in look, it's super cute.",1
"I bought this shirt in white, i have worn it 2 ways so far and love it. i wore it under a pull over and had the tail ends stick out and it was great that way, and i wore it with a long cardigan. i received a lot of compliments on it. i will be buying it in red!!",1

"I really loved the idea of this dress and thought it may be perfect for work with a pair of wedges. but, the first thing that set me off was the color and the material. the color is more street sign yellow than a soft, warm yellow. the fabric is a thin, sheet like fabric that makes the yellow look even cheaper. i was anticipating a thicker shirt-like fabric. when i tried it on, i liked the idea, but the material and the color made me feel like i was wearing costume...or a parachute. i will defin",0
"Beautiful,well made top.it just runs small not for me",0
"The pattern is very adorable. unfortunately the design is flawed. sizing is great at the waist and hip, and the length is spot on, but the top is wide. it's strange because i don't think it would fit someone that was bustier than me either.
will return. i'm considering buying again on sale and having a tailor correct it.",0
"...maybe i would've kept this top. i love the print, colors, and design. however, i feel like i had too much of a bosom to wear it. since my bust and torso seemed too large for it, the peplum ruffle bottom lining and top straps did not look good.",1
"I wanted to love this dress. the cut, fit and color are adorable. unfortunately the fabric is super thin. due to the material type it can be clingy in a manner that requires the anti-static spray your mom used to use in the 80s. i was on the fence of keeping it, but if there is so much as a wrinkle in your panty-line the whole world will see it. i would hate to have to wear a slip with this due to static issue. i am most likely going to return it; even at 15% off, it is over-priced for the cheap",0

A gorgeous and vibrant print! love the ruffles on the bottom and the detailing of the straps in the back. perfect for a beach day!,1

This is going to be perfect for my daughter's graduation. she is in love with it and it looks amazing on her!,1
"The fabric is absolutely lovely on these, but very thin. the top part was tighter than usual (and i sized up from my regular pilcro jean size) and they flare a lot. so the thin, tight top was not a flattering look. the rise also felt short. 

i'm 5' 4"" with a 30"" inseam and the regular length just hovered above my ankles. my husband burst out laughing when i tried them on, which is never a good reaction!  even if i hemmed them, i think these are a miss for me. will be returning.

"I finally ordered this at this incredible mark downed price...but i see why. it is cute, but serious size issues, i have a bust but smaller everywhere else but i did order up because of it being a jumpsuit...i would have needed 6"" more to even zip the top part! i have many trendy jumpsuits in my closet and this is a first! if you are flat chested you may want to try at this great price as it would be a great piece for sitting by the fireside next fall/winter...never too soon to plan ahead!",0

"I love it but i don't at the same time:

sheer, so sheer, you can probably get away with a nude bra, but not sure... i tried on both colors, and love them both. love the shimmer... i ordered btoh xxs p and xxs regular...i think i would go with regular, the petite seemed cropped on me, so if i lift my arms, hello belly...

so overall, i would probably get this if it goes on sale, color is either way, but since i don't have an immediate need, i passed. nice turtleneck, though.

"This dress is gorgeous! the colors are deep and rich and the fabric is super soft. the top part is lined but still avoids feeling like it would be too hot when the temperatures warm up. bonus-- a regular bra works perfectly underneath without anything showing, even with the deep v neckline. while the waist does sit a bit high, it works perfectly on my body-- emphasizes the smallest part of my waist and then flows away. it drapes nicely, not too full and not too clingy. i am 5'7 and a true size 6",1
"When i first received this sweater, i was a little worried about the bulk, especially the thick cables and popcorn stitches. after i got it on and adjusted it to all the right places, i would say it looks similar to the model in the photo. i did not find it itchy. the yarn is soft and airy but i guess it depends on how sensitive your skin is. the length was low hip on me and i'm 5'9"" tall. overall, i'm very pleased and looking forward to wearing it. can't speak to the quality of the garment beca",1
I am 5.1 and 113lbs. i ordered the petite size 26 and it fits like a glove. i gave 4 starts as i wish i had less stretch in it but other than that they are perfect length and sooo soft. super happy with the cut and waist height!,1

I was so excited to receive this sweater in the mail since my local store didn't carry it. it is a very cute design if you have a smaller frame but i'm curly up top and it didn't lay they way it did on the model. there's plenty of stretch. unfortunately the fabric sheds and itches terribly. you could wear a shirt underneath but i'd have to wear a turtleneck so it'll be going back.,0
"This dress is gorgeous! i ordered it because i was getting other things and there was free shipping., i am 5'3.5"" and abt 123 lbs. usually between an xs and s and also between reg & petite. sometimes i have to order multiple sizes to get a decent fit. i ordered a sz small petite and it's perfect. super soft, great colors, perfect length!! love it!",1
"I really wanted these jeans to work but i am too curvy and not tall enough for them. i just felt like they were swallowing me up with fabric. i am 5'5"" and had a stacked boot heel on when i tried them on and they were still too long. i felt like they made me look even bigger than i am. the fabric is nice, not as dark as the photo as others have said.",0
"These are the perfect dressy 'jeans'. they are super soft but have the right amount of structure. they sit higher on the waist, which is one reason they are so flattering. the other reason is the flared, long leg! very long, in fact. i'm 5'5, 130 lbs and ordered a size 28. they fit me perfectly but i do have to wear them with my tall heels - which makes them perfect for work, with pumps as well as for casual outfits with tall wedges. if my size wasn't sold out, i'd order another pair - they are",1
Trousers fit tts with nice thick fabric and great fit. the length was perfect for my 5'9 height. they are flattering very nice quality.,1
"These wide cut stretchy demon trousers are so flattering; i'm 6' and 160, which translates into curvy territory. i didn't need extra length, and the size 32 was bigger than i need, but not too big. these are very classy looking, and go with sandals to booties for every type of look, summer to winter,  with a breezy top or a cozy sweater.  
the revisitation of bell bottoms and culottes had me slightly down: those cuts are not the most flattering for most people. these jeans are smart but trendy;",1
"These are super comfortable and with heels can be very flattering. i like the fact that you can wear them with or without the belt. 
however i wish that the color was the same darkness as shown online. they are lighter and a bit duller. i look at a few pairs and they are all the same. still love them but i'm sure they would have been even more fantastic if they looked like the picture.",1
"I ordered these in the blue size 28p. i am 5' 120 lbs. a size 6p and curvy. the jeans fit very nicely in thigh and hip area (and i don't have skinny thighs). the jean is not a low rise which is what i was looking for. i was looking for a jean that was a little dressier yo wear out to grab a drink or catch a movie. these jeans fit the bill because they give off a polished vibe, especially when paired with a dressier top, blazer, skinny belt and heels. also, i like that the jeans don't have the to",1
"I love this dress as far as the fit goes. it makes my curvy figure loook even better with how it's cut. that being said the different patterns over each boob made the dress look crazy. it makes you look quite lopsided in the chest. wasn't just me, but my store people also agreed. had the pattern on the chest been the same it would be great, but even though my boobs are of ""mostly"" equal size, they looked too crazy. it's quite noticeable on. so sad:(",0

"The cut and design of this dress is lovely! the fabric is heavy enough for fall/winter, but the sleeveless style makes it a great transition piece for when the weather warms up again. it does run slightly larger than most other retailer dresses. i sized down to a 2 from a 4. the bust stretches a bit for the ladies who might be heavier on top (i'm a 34 dd), however, i noticed the white shows through in dark places around my bust. also, the boning in the front pushed against the fabric a bit",1

"I tried on a small, but usually am xs:

this shirt dind't seem like it had too much fabric or too bulky to me as it did to others adn i tried on a larger size. teh material is soft and feminine, and love the embroidered detail. one thing to note is i found that even with the layer of fabric, it was still a bit sheer and i could see through in some of the dressing room lighting. didn't purchase only based on the skin tone v's shirt color. color of shirt is gorgeous, but i am pale and it wasn't",1

was tight, but they are supposed to fit tight. if i wasn't so ""hippy"" i would have kept them. the model is
slender with long legs and she looks fantastic in them. not me. i do recommend these as they are cute, but perhaps geared for a more slender body type.",1

"This dress is made of a wonderful, thick material that is flattering. i think the photo doesn't really bring it to life- it's a great dress that can dressed up and is at least a 3 season dress thanks to the colors. the v-neck is a little deep if you are bustier but not inappropriate for a slightly more casual office. it runs a bit large and the fabric has some give so i would potentially size down. i also think if you are more narrow shouldered it might not be the best fit without a nip and tuck",1
"Pretty color, great details, awesome stitching.. aaaaannnnnnd it actually not only goes out a line but ballooned out above the hem and then came back in - just too much fabric down below. nice at neck, arms and chest but disastrous anywhere below that.",0
This top is beautiful but beware there is a lot of extra material on the sides. it was not flattering on only because of all the excess fabric. clearly the model in the picture has it pinned behind her. it would be a keeper if it was cut closer to the body but sadly it's going back.,0

I almost never buy full price but i did with this skirt.  it is adorable! saw it in the store.  it is too short to wear to work but is fine for casual wear.  i am a size 14 but the largest one they had was a 12 and it fit perfectly.  i&#39;d size down. the fabric is stiff and the a-line stands out.  colors are southwesternish.  can be worn with any color top.  i bought a cream colored top to wear with it (that was on the sale rack) but i'm sure there are plenty things in the closet that will go.,1
"I'm 5""1, 115 and bought the small. i buy most retailer tops in xs but the small fit well - not too tight and is flattering. the colors are as seen and are a soft muted color. the material is thin which is fine for hot weather and i haven't washed so can't say how colors will hold and how well material will hold but have high expectations for retailer apparel. this will work well to wear with shorts or a navy maxi skirt. adds a nice touch of color for spring and summer.",1
"Very lovely dress!!! perfect in all ways. although i do find it to run big. i ordered the small, and i usually wear a 4 to 6 in a dress. there is a lot of fabric, but it lays nicely. it's mostly just the arm hole. it's rather large showing the strapless bra. so, deciding if i should size down, if there isn't a huge change in sizing, or keep and have altered.
if anyone has tried in both the xs and sm i will watch for comments overall size differences. i have the black and white, and wish now i wo",1
"Based on other reviews that this top ran large, i ordered this online in two sizes. both seemed to fit alright in my chest (although the chest fit tighter in the smaller size), and both were much too big on the bottom. the front bottom of this shirt has a series of pleats, so the bottom of this top really, really, really flared out away from my hips. the length seemed fine on me (5'10""). the material is very thin, and i could see my nude bra through the white pattern.",0
I bought this top in pink today and it is a beautiful bright pink spring color. i did have to size down from my normal size six all the way down to a 2 due to armholes being being too big. i tend to have a chronic problems with armholes being big so not sure others may find the same problem however i typically size down to a 4 when armholes too big. plenty of room in body still but i lost some length. i do have a short torso so can get a way with this. aside from my armhole problem it is a gorge,1

"This is a very flattering and comfortable top that can easily transition into fall. i can't wait to wear it (i have the black and white one) under my new leather jacket! the store was out of my size, so i had to order the top, which came with a small snag. i trimmed the thread and wore it anyway! it is also long enough to wear with leggings.",1
Just bought the patterned and gray. the small fit perfect. i do have a short torso though. chest size 32dd. i tried the medium but then the underarm portion was too wide. i might have gotten a medium petite but small petite would have been too small i think. i hope the quality holds up which was the only thing i wasn't sure of. great summer tank to throw on with jeans or shorts.,1
This flared skirt caught my attention the first time it came up in the website.  i am more a florals and lace kind of girl but the flattering shape and stripes kept me going back to it agin and again.  i finally saw it in person at my store and needed to try it on.  perfect! the colors are matte and not metallic as i thought based on the website photo.  you can definitely dress it down with a chambray too or t shirt.  i wore it to a work meeting and can't wait to wear it again.  it's a bit on th,1

"I ordered the coral/peach version in size 16. it ran small, especially compared to other size 14 or 16 maeve blouses i've purchased. very tight throughout the blouse. the product photos looked so nice compared to what arrived. the material was extremely cheap in quality. it wrinkled terribly. the bow pulled the material down which obscured the look of the eyelet. the idea of this was perfect for my style. unfortunately, the poor choice in material & poor fit made this a return for me.",0
"I got this skirt earlier this week and wore it for the first time today. i love the color and the shape. everyone else loved it on me. it looked great with a buttondown. but, i will say that it's short. i'm usually a petite in bottoms, and i wore tights so i wouldn't flash anyone when i bent down. i can only imagine how it would be on a taller girl. it also fits at the natural waist instead of the hip. i'm usually a size 6 in bottoms, but i bought the size 4 because it sits higher up.",1
"This top is amazing!! i thought it looked really cute in the photos but it's even cuter online. the material is great and you can't go wrong with the fit. i love tops that are loose and flowy, so when i'm feeling a bit bloated i can still look cute in tops. this one is definitely a must!",1
"Definitely size down, the waist and chest were baggy in my normal size s.",0
"The fabric was more ""southwestern"" looking when i got it than it looked in the pics. it fit a bit larger around the bottom than i like.",1
"This dress is gorgeous, but the cut of the neck and arms is designed for girls with a slim frame only. i wish it worked? the fabric and pattern are beautiful. sad to send it back.",1
"The pattern and fabric are very nice! i'm usually an 8/m for dresses. it was very narrow across the top (and i have a small chest), but hung very low in the armpit. i guess if you're small up top, this might fit better.",0
"I received tons of compliments on this dress. the print is fun and works well with the modest shape. i love the high neckline and the long hem. it's different and cool.
my only complaint: the arm holes fall super low. i didn't realize until i looked at photos but my bra was very visible.",1
"I love this sweater because it is so versatile! it looks casual with jeans, but i plan to wear it to the opera with dressy black slacks. the beautiful black embroidery is unusual and asymmetrical in back.",1
"I bought 2 in the store.  i usually order large petite but i was in the store which doesn't have petites, so i tried a large, and it was tight in the bust, but i loved the shape.  i ended up buying xl's and taking them up at the shoulders to make it a petite fit.  gives me a small looking waistline.",1
"I did not purchase because it was too low cut for my liking, but otherwise really liked this top. i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are 38-30-40 for reference",1
"Great fit! for reference, i am 5'7"", 160 lbs and bought a size medium. there is a piece of fabric that acts as a cami underneath to prevent any unwanted reveal with the lace up. soft fabric and falls beautifully!",1
I absolutely love this top. i thought it was going to be to big but it fits perfectly. fitted and flattering.,1
The sizing and length are great had it not been for my chest area. i sized up from my usual medium but the pleats create a maternity look for me unfortunately. it truly is a great tank top!,1
"When you look at the online pictures of the navy colored dress, the stripes are diagonal. however, that is not the case with the dress in person. the stripes are all horizontal and not that flattering. such a bummer because i love maeve dresses and thought this would be a great addition to my summer dress rotation. alas, not very flattering, so back it goes.",0
"My hips are very narrow and i don't have much of a waistline. in a-line skirts and anything that sits below the waist, i wear a size 6. skirts like this with a defined waist almost never work for me because of the waistline. if this is typically your style of skirt, i think it will run large because the waistline is more generous than usual. 

 i tried it on in the store today and bought it in a size 8. it's very comfortable and cute and will be easy to pair with different things.",1
"I really liked this top when i saw it in yellow but i was on the fence about ordering it for a while. when i did order it i chose the pink at the last second. i love it. i've worn it several times with a pair of jeans and cardigan. it travels nicely in the suitcase, no need to pull the iron out. i wear a cami underneath but it's really not that sheer so you don't need to. it's a lovely piece",1
"The print is beautiful, the fabric has a nice weight. i actually bought this because i'm early in pregnancy and wanted a dress i can wear during the transition period - because of its swing shape, this is one of those rare dresses that looks good on me now and will still look good on me in 6 months when i've got a huge belly.

fit-wise: i am 5'9, 155 lbs, 34d, and ordered a large, but i am exchanging it for a medium. the arm holes are also a bit large.",1
I gave this in her brighter rose colored print and love it! i get many compliments on this top! i did size up from my usual small to a medium to accommodate the girls :),1
"Made of casual materials, perfect for drinks or to be used as a vacation top. has a very flattering cut and pretty design with chiffon trim on top.",1
This top is perfect for summer. it delivers style without the bulk. the peplum hit perfect for my 5'4 frame. unfortunately it was too low cut in the front. i had to return it.,0
Fun pattern which goes with just about anything. cool for summer.  very comfortable.  fitted style but true to size.,1
"I was so excited to get this top in the mail. i loved the colors, print, cut, everything. i put it on and was so disappointed, the top looks so much better on the model. i don't know if i should have gone down a size (i go between an xs and s), but it looked terrible on me! my husband took one look at me in it and said that's being returned. still disappointed",0
"Love the fabric, print, and cut! it's a smidge low in the neckline, but that's probably because i'm busty. nice and breezy for our blazing hot and humid florida summers.",1
"I was looking for a flowier top to wear under cardigans, and this is pretty perfect. it is more sheer than i would like, but because i am wearing it as a bottom layer, i'll overlook that. the fit is great and the peplum is a cute detail to make this layering piece a little different.",1
"Love this top - on sale, i bought two of this color, a grey and the green, i never buy more than one of anything unless i absolutely love it ! complimentary to the body, and the colors are beautiful. i'm 5'2"" there were no pxs so i opted for xs, perfect... thanks retailer ??",1
"Purchased on sale, would have never purchased at full price. runs small and runs short. will be returning.",0
"I really loved this vest online and decided to try it on in store. it was really cute on and fit nicely so i purchased it (in my normal size) and took it on a vacation. first time wearing it and the color transferred all over my white shirt even though it says it is pre-washed. i am very disappointed considering how expensive this was. overall, it is very cute but it may ruin your clothes so beware!",0
This dress is amazing! the photos do not do it justice! runs a tad large - definitely can size down.,1
"I ordered the copper in a medium which i felt was tts (5'4"" 145). the color is beautiful and i love the buttons on the shoulders which i really didn't notice in the picture, the material is also very soft. but i have some complaints.. first i felt that the material, while soft, was not very substantial for the price. i purchased another vest from that store that has everything which was $100 less and seems to be the same quality. i also was expecting there to be some way to close the vest beside",1
"This shirt is purportedly made of silk, but it is extremely low quality. the material is coarse and scratchy. it's not even worth it at the extra 40% off sale price. returned.",0
"This is a lovely dress - however, there is a weird flap of fabric under the bow that doesn't sit right. it feels a little like a bib. if i could get it to sit right, i would keep it. every angle of the dress is lovely except for head on - which is a small problem.",1
"The sleeves were very tight in the upper arm area but the body was blousy, too blousy so to go up a size for the arms would mean it would be very oversized in the body. i like the fabric (nice and thick) but it did not work for me.",0
The perfect dress for dinner date or summer weddings. or traveling. love this dress. not sure on washing yet since it is a silk dress. extremely comfortably and beautiful. i can't recall the last time i bought a new dress.,1
"According to the label, this dress can be hand washed or dry cleaned. i hand washed and line dried per the instructions on the label, and all the seams have completely shrunk and gathered. it looks like there's a drawstring running through every seam. so disappointed in the quality and the labeling. awful! i gave it one extra star because it's cute.",0
"This shirt was tent like on me and there was really no way around it. i am fairly small- usually a 4 or 6 in tops, and smaller on top- barely 34b. this top was incredibly unflattering, falling to cut right at my hips and sitting open and way too flowy-- like a pillowcase/sacklike fit. there was just too much fabric here to make it work for me. it's unfortunate because it looks adorable in the product photo and i love the plaid mix with the open shoulders- a nice transition to fall. unfortunately",0
I absolutely love this sweater....it is perfect for fall,1
"The burgundy plaid colors are what caught my eye! so perfect for the fall season. i usually do not like off the shoulder tops as most do not stay down but this one does and as others have stated there are arm stays inside to help with that. i stayed with my usual small to keep the length and it was fine. got compliments the first time i wore it. so glad they restocked in my size, as they had been sold out.",1
"I like the way this vest looks: it's flattering and the color is nice, just like in the pictures (i got the orange one). i am 5'7"", 125 lb, got size s, and i am very happy about the fit.

just keep in mind that the material is very soft and thin. it is good for summer, but i expected the material to be more... firm... something to be worn on cooler windier days. also, the vest does not close - i would prefer the vest to have a zipper or buttons.

but if you need a fun and cute summer accesso",1
I normally get a small in this style shirt but it didn't fit at all so i had to send it back. too bad,1
"I saw this vest at my local retailer store over the weekend and decided to try it on. i am typically an xs at retailer and the xs fit perfectly. i can't wait to wear this during the spring and summer. it's really lightweight and soft which i love. i purchased the copper color, and would consider the color in the photo to be very true. this was definitely a splurge, but i am overall very happy with my purchase. i highly recommend it!",1
This jumpsuit is great dressed up or down. the only issue i had with it is that the straps are very long (but that was an easy fix).,1
"Fell in love with this dress when i saw it online and ordered it right away. however i was sadly disappointed once it arrived. while the cut is cute, the fabric is just all wrong. i was expecting a nice, heavy knit-like material, but this feels and looks really cheap - especially given the price of the dress. sadly it is going back.",0
"Again, nope. looks chic on the model, looked like a floor-length flannel nightgown on me. if you'd put a bonnet on me and stuck a candlestick in my hand, i could double for ebenezer scrooge in ""a christmas carol."" i believe the word i used to describe it when i tried it on was ""shmata"" (yiddish for ""rags). it looked like i was wearing a rag. the ruching didn't do anything to flatter my figure, the knit did not seem terribly warm for a sweater (felt more like rayon or nylon jersey than a knit swe",0
"The simple shape of this silky & comfortable shift is transported by the fun psychedelic pattern. the fabric is lightweight and drapes very nicely because of the lining. i purchased the size 10 petite to accommodate my 36dd bust/wide rib cage and it fits perfectly. the high neck is fastened with a single hook. versatile and comfortable and a clear winner for spring and summer. for sizing reference my other stats are 5'3"" tall, 140#, m/l on top, s/m on bottom.",1
"Got this today and am really pleased. beautiful detail and i love how the cowl neck hangs. it's not itchy at all. overall, a great find for the colder months ahead. i got a small and probably should have ordered xs  instead. runs a little big on my petite frame.",1
"Here's an example of lowering a hemline and slapping the term 'petite' on it. too much fabric, was bulky, and ran too small. the fabric was thin and pulled awkwardly over the bust. returned..",0
I returned this item. it was soft. very blah fabric. nothing special.,0
"I had a really, really difficult time reviewing this dress. the instant i touched it, i wanted to love it! in theory, it should have worked for me. fit and flare is usually a really great option for my pear shape. the silhouette shows off my thinner upper body and camouflages my thicker lower body. best of both worlds! however, as you can see for yourself in the photo, this dress makes me look pretty big. i'm a solid size 8 and i feel this dress makes me look like a 12. it really makes my middle",1
"I tried this on today because when i touched it, it was irresistibly soft. i like the orange, it was a loud orange-and i almost would have preferred some sort of design to it. i did not purchase this because at the end of the day it did not suit my style-it was very plain. i think you could dress it up with the addition of a belt or the right necklace, but i am not usually a fan of buying pieces that do not stand on their own and require an accessory. that said, it was very comfortable and soft",0
"I knew that the cut of this shirt was boxy, but this is huge.  i wear a l or xl at retailer, and i got the m/l and was swimming in this top.  sadly, this will be going back.",0
"The dress has a flattering cut and is a nice color. but, the fabric looks like old, matted carpet. i will be returning.",0
"I like design of the dress, softness and color ( i got grey), the dress is shorter on me then on model ( 5'6"" 145 lbs) i got m fits ok but i don't like fabric quality it seems like it can be peeled and picks up everything and needs to be sprayed all the time. despite i got it with 40% discount it will come back as it's poor quality.",0
"I bought this dress in-store, and it's fantastic. i'm between a medium and a large, and i bought a large because it was the one available, and it's fantastic. some of the polyester is fraying between the seams, which is obviously not ideal, but i'm willing to overlook that for generally how great this dress is.",1
"Cute style, cute color, cute cut.  and i got it on sale!",1
"Bought on a whim, on sale.  i am a small in 95% retailer but got these in m for comfy casual looseness--perfect.  i am 5'8"", and these hit the top of my feet--perfect.  fabric is substantial but not heavy--perfect for cool so. cal evenings.   color is rich denimy blue--beautiful.  buttons are pretty. i have nothing negative to say about these aside from their price (even on sale).  oh, and the knot.  as i sit on my squishy leather sofa, i feel the knot in my back.  hmmm.  oh well.  still love them",1
"Soooo disappointed in this dress. the colors are beautiful for fall. the fabric feels luxe. the slip fits perfectly. the dress however is a hot mess. it is easily two times more fabric than needed to create a flow-y aline dress. huge everywhere. under the arms, and waist and hips. it's just an enormous tent. i am 5'8"", 128 lbs. i ordered my usual size small. i looked shapeless in this. i can't think of any body type it would flatter. potentially, women quite far along in their pregnancy.",0
"I bought this to give room for an expanding tummy - i'm 6 months pregnant and this completely conceals the bulge.  i suspect i will appreciate that in the spring when i'm actually trying to hide my leftover belly... it's incredibly soft and the top is wide enough to cover a bra strap.  the arm holes are small enough to cover my parts but large enough to be comfy.  i'm 5'5"", medium build and normally wear a medium but got a large given my circumstances.  a medium would have probably worked normal",1
"I was very excited when i saw this in a perk email and immediately went to order it. unfortunately, the stock image of this pullover is misleading. it's boxy (image makes it seem like it's form-fitting) and the weave/mesh is much thicker and open in person. as shown, you do need a cami underneath. i ordered this in a small and medium since it's an online exclusive and there were no other products by on the road to see reviews of to know how their tops fit. i wanted to love this. i didn't think i",1
"Love the color and overall design of this dress...but it's just going to have to go back. the view from the direct front and back are nice, but froth side the high waist and secure back make me look pregnant. not the look i'm going for especially at this price.

the other oddity is that the white circle design is unfortunately placed! in the back it's all i see which is 'right' on a bulls-eye and the same on the front. i don't know how the designer missed this! it's the only white design on th",0
"Not at all tapered at waist as suggested here by photos. i have wide shoulders and am slim, and this made me look big all around. i am doubtful a smaller size would correct this- i am 5'10"" and ordered a medium. also, it curls under a bit at the waist. one nice thing about the cream is that it is not see through. anyway, i purchased this to go with high waisted skirts but am returning.",0
"Bought this dress on sale in the orange as i feel like everything i have is black. it is a pretty orange not too bright, more of a rust color. it is very soft as stated in other reviews and has a nice built in slip that is very comfortable. i worry about pilling down the road but will have to wait and see. i am not crazy about the seams down the chest area. i think they could be more flattering but overall the dress is comfortable, cute and easy to wear, a perfect dress for the fall/winter with",1
"I felt like i was taking a risk by ordering these without trying them on, but i am so happy i did. they are soft and solid without being thick or stiff. incredibly comfortable. i have a larger hip and booty and these fit great. no grabbing at all and without making the top too big or loose.",1
"Love these, always get compliments. i'm 5'7"" bought size small. washed in warm & line dried. they are a bit shorter. lengthen the straps, drops the waist, but at least gets them to my feet",1
"This top is flowy, fluid and comfortable. the material is like a stretchy crepe. it's thin, but not sheer. well, i bought the bright red (maybe white is sheer?). oh, speaking of bright red, well it is! i mean, it is the most vibrant red. the photo on-line (at least on my screen) doesn't really do the red justice at all.

the fit is true to size. the nice thing about this top is that it has movement and yet it isn't full of fabric and look like a maternity top. and, the armholes are not big. th",1
"I took this in a large. im a 36d 140lbs. this top in a large fit me perfectly without a bra. slightly see through but not by much... i haven't tried it with a bra on yet, but im sure it'll be just fine.",1
"I had the pleasure of trying this on today and looooooove it. i love all things bows, but usually they are off-centered over the left shoulder. i have a bit of an ocd thing, and i prefer things to be over my right shoulder so usually while i love them, i can't wear them. i love that this bow is in the middle-and i like that it is higher than the neckline of the shirt so you know there is some skin underneath. it adds to the sexiness of the blouse while also creating a more pleasing look. i feel",1
This material of this shirt is soft and appealing. great for fall. the side slits are longer than they appear in the picture so wearing it both tucked and untucked requires a layering shirt underneath.,1
I am very petite and ordered the xs. it is too big which is often the case. i gauge how much i like something by my willingness to spend even more money on alterations. i love this jacket so much that i am willing to go through that extra step. i love winter and this is a perfect winter top. the faux fur is very soft and cozy and has a rich look to it. i have yet to have it altered which is the only reason for my 4 stars under quality. i don't yet know how it will fit once complete. the fact tha,1
"This top isn't straight as it would seem on the ""tucked-in"" picture on the model. colros are really rpetty and neutral in eprson. fabric si very soft. i tried on the 0 but am wondering about trying on 00 or petite size...which i would have to order, so will wait a bit on this one.",1
I purchased this jacket as a gift for my daughter for christmas. i thought it would look nice on her and i love retailer. she was very surprised and loved it. she wore the jacket the next day and it looked lovely on her. a very unique and beautiful addition to her wardrobe.,1
"I tried this on a whim last week even though it was a bit above my budget, and i couldn't resist taking it home. the photo doesn't do the textured sheen of the silk justice--the metallic tones of the flowers are really vibrant, but still subtle. my husband (who usually hates anything with a bow) loves this, though i have been tying the bow a bit lower than shown on the model. go one size down--i usually wear a 14 in blouses but took a 12 in this.",1
"Just so i'm clear, the only reason i said it runs large is b/c of the top portion, but the bottom or waist. loved this romper when i saw it online, it was however too big in the top portion. the straps are adjustable but the back is too low for a bra and it ""gaps"" too much in the front unless you are standing straight all day.

also b/c i'm 5'8, the small was just a tad too short, definitely no bending !

i'm 5'8 tall, 127lbs with an average size chest #34c# i ordered a small and the bottom",0
"I just received this top - it is stunningly beautiful, however, i will be returning it as it is very large. i am tall at 5'8"" and typically wear a size 4. i purchased this in the size s but it was very large. i should have read the reviews about sizing before ordering, although i think both the xxs and xs were already sold out.",1
The picture doesn't do this justice. this top is amazing in person. i purchased my regular size 2. it is very versatile and the colors are perfect as well as cut and material. worth the money,1
"This skirt runs very large--even in the petite line. there was also no shape to the skirt (at least as it looked on my body). the color was nice (in the pink-grapeish hue), but ultimately the skirt just looked like a tent on my body (00p).",0
"I love this top. the seam does go across the bustling but if you are small chested like me...it is perfect. very bohemian and an almost classic look with a very contemporary twist. there are splits up the side that show off a great pair of leggings. i wore this today with some lysee black and grey patterned leggings, a long grey camisole, and some cute short free people booties...i may have gotten 20 compliments. love it.",1
"I ordered the top from a store to have it shipped. 
it is very pretty but once on, it fit the wrong way. i got a small because i know that this designer tends to run tight across the bust. 
the shoulder was too rounded for this neck line. sleeves should have been either longer or sleeveless. the empire waist even on a smaller busted woman like myself was cut too high.",0
Ii loved the idea of this summer top flowing in the breeze... then i got it and the selves did nit give as much slack as i would have hoped #spandex so #returned!,0
This blouse has a very cute style. the ruffles are really nice but why does it have to be so sheer? there is no way i could wear this to work without a cami. it also felt slightly on the small size - almost too tight for my normal size.,0
"So comfy, great quality, not see thru at all, has a liner that you cant even tell is there. wish it was a little smaller- got an xxsp but going to keep it anyway, dont need a bra.",1
I love these pants but they run super big and still stretch after wearing. i am usually a 2/ 26 and had to get a 0. also the pocket flaps stick up on the corners and ironing doesnt help.  still comfortable but i would have never paid full price for these if i had known.,0
"I'm a vest lover of all shapes, lengths and styles so i had big plans for this vest.  in the end, the pockets ended up ruining the lay and line of this vest.  they are too bulky and end up pulling at the front of the vest, drawing your eye to the pockets and not the neckline.  i agree with previous reviews that it could be worn into spring- i wouldn't wear it in summer.  the fit is loose, i thought the medium arm holes were large for my frame- 5'8"" 140#.  overall i sent it back.",0
Love the movement of the blouse and how it falls. great quality material.,1
"This blouse is a beauty! i love the hemline across the bust and all the flowy fabric that drapes in front and in back. i love the long length and the side slits. the wide hemline at the bottom is lovely. the cotton is soft and light and as amazing to wear as it is to look at. it makes me feel beautiful just having it on. be aware the fabric is sheer and requires a tank, but i don't mind as it is both pretty and comfortable. i sized up, which fits how i like. i never tried it on in my normal size",1
"Hey hei hei! where did your side buttons go on this design? on all of the other hei hei's i own there are two or three very cute side buttons at the hips in belt area with a matching also cute cloth strip attached so that when the pant becomes too lose at the waist you can tighten it up a notch.

"I adore a good vest, so when i saw this one at my retailer i had to try it on immediately. i don't wear cream often, but the design and weight of this vest is dreamy. i tried it on at the store and i was on the fence. so i bought it, took it home and tried it on with everything. i am a curvy girl, and i wasn't thrilled with how this fit. now its part of the retailer athleisure line, and i could definitely see this being worn post workout with cute workout gear. girls who are tall and thin, or even w",1

"I bought this top in hopes of getting a lot of wears out of it as we transition from summer to fall. the color is a pretty rust color perfect for fall, but also great for late summer. i love the leaf print, and the dark buttons on the sides really take the top to the next level. i love wearing this top with my high-waisted flare jeans, i get tons of compliments when i wear this top! it is definitely sheer, which i like, so i wish that it came with its own detachable camisole (the reason i took a",1

The shirt does have a weird yellow tinge as other reviewers have described. i could get over that if the shirt was a flattering fit which it was not. not worth the money so i returned it.,0
"This top is so soft and with a henley neck opening and longer ribbed shirttail hems, it not only feels heavenly against the skin but it gives off a casual chic vibe. it is also great for layering under shorter sweaters and sweatshirts to give my staples a little oomph. it is a bit sheer so cami is a must. i am also not sure how well it will hold up after washings, especially since it's priced quite high. i love it so much that i will most probably end up keeping it it is true to size. i ordered",1
"I was on the fence about keeping but the more i tried it on, the more i liked it. i feel like it will be a great winter casual top the reason i was on the fence was because its pretty big. i'm 5'4 and 108 and the xs is pretty voluminous on me. it's just so darn different and feminine though that i'm going to live with the fact that there is so much material. i think it is still cute. the fabric is also really soft on the inside so it will be cozy too.",1
I bought this to go with the pants they had online & i love them together. the sweater seems thin for the price but i still love it.,1

"The color of this dress is gorgeous and i really wanted to love it. but, it was awful. i am 5'9'' and the length was fine. the problem is the lack of shape which made me look 50 - 100 lbs heavier than i am. it would make a great maternity dress since that is what it already looks like.",0

"I tried this on in the store and the colors and fabric are terrific. it's very light-weight fabric but isn't see-through. the colors are medium in depth, not too bright. if you typically wear ""cool"" colors and avoid browns, you may be able to wear this because the brown is very muted. there's two strings inside that you tie around your waist to pull the bust of the dress in. i'm 5'4"" and 125 lbs, so there's simply too much fabric in the dress. i would have bought a petite. the tag says it's avai",0
"I found this piece very boxy and not very feminine. i tried to make it work but i just wasn't feeling it the material is thin and the design is boring. unfort, it wasn't for me.",0
"I thought this top looked adorable. and the material was soft. tops like these don't usually look great on someone who is a little bit busty, it can make you look fat or like you're wearing maternity. but the real issue was the arm holes were large and seemed to gape a bit. it just didn't look flattering. even if you wore a cute, lacy bandeau bra, the way the material sticks out around the arm holes would still look awkward. too bad, since it is a cute top, and well made.",0
"I really liked this cardigan when i saw it today. the cut and detail in the back is slimming and very flattering. i love the idea of the safety pin closure, and i really like how the model wears it in this photo-open with the pin on the side. when i saw this in-store, it was closed in the front with the pin, which i also like. i thought for sure the cardigan was also pinned in back when i saw it in the model, so it looked fantastic. however, when i tried it on myself, it wasn't quite the same.",0
"I am usually a size small and had to size down to an xsmall. as mentioned in another review, it runs large in the armholes and across the bust, which is why i'm counting off one star. the armholes are also cut in quite a bit, so i will wear either a strapless or racerback bra. i am fairly small busted and the gathers falling from the yoke lay nicely; however, i can see that it might not work for someone who is more amply endowed and that it might have a maternity look. that said, the detailing i",1
I ordered the blue version in size xl. it looked just like the photos online. it fit true to size. the problem for me was the weight of the sweater. it was too bulky & uncomfortable to wear. the color of blue was nice. the knit wasn't very soft but wasn't scratchy either. i found a better choice from retailer so i returned this.,1
"These are horrible pants!!! they run small in the thigh and butt like other cartonnier crops. look great at first....after a few hours of wear the stretch out everywhere!!! absolutely terrible! i have several pairs of cartonnier crops that are my ""go to"" pants, but these are not worth even the sale price! i'd give them no stars if i could!! this fabric is very different from my other printed pairs. if u must try them, size down and suffer through the first few ""tight"" hours! trust me...they will",0
Ordered this in white and the peachy color- the armholes were gaping. not well designed. i don't recommend this tee at all.,0
This is a great sweater. soft and beautiful. it's my new go to sweater??,1
"I wanted to love these because they are so pretty and come in lots of colors, but after only a few minutes of wearing them, i was having to pull them out of my bottom! why does women's underwear so frequently ride up? i normally wear a size 4/28, and ordered these in a m, but i guess they were still too small, which seems unreasonable to me. they are soft and pretty, but i will not be ordering more.",0
"I'd been eyeing this skirt on the website, and was pleasantly surprised to find one hanging on the sale rack in a local store. i couldn't leave it behind. the silver embroidery and the lovely, flowinng weight of the tulle layers make this a beautiful skirt. i'm just over 5"" 4"" and it skims the floor on me with a 2"" heel. can't wait to wear it!",1
"I loved the idea of this dress and was hoping it would be worth the astronomical price tag for what really is a cotton jersey dress. unfortunately, this dress missed the mark. in the pictures this dress looks like the fabrics are navy blue and some sort of white. well, it is not white or whitish at all but baby pink! bright baby pink! even the light pattern on the navy background is actually pink. huge disappointment. my other issue is with the length of this dress. the description says that the",0
"Saw this online and ran over to the store to try it on. so lovely! i thought i would want it in the cream color but the blue was so lovely in person. it's like a muted blue that makes it so versatile. the detail in the back is gorgeous and so flattering. the safety pin is such a unique touch. it's nice and warm, just not super soft, but not scratchy. i do think i will be extra careful with it because it seems like it could get caught on things easily.",1
"Love this shirt. i am 5'2"" and 115 lbs. i am normally a pxs and got the pxxs and it got perfect! my new favorite shirt.",1
"I tried this on in white and my usual size small. it is such a beautiful top and the detailing, lace trim is so pretty. my only complaint is that it lays funny on my cleavage, and i don't have much. it just gathered there and appeared clingy in that area. it's also one of those...am i hiding a pregnancy tops. i like it, but i think i'll wait to see if it goes on sale.",1
"Beware! there is a reason this sweater is on sale. it is not even remotely the same color as pictured. instead of the lovely antique blue in the photo, this sweater is a faded, boring, teal-green. what a huge disappointment.",0
I knew i had to have these when i saw them on one of the retailer store instagrams. i bought them in the blue color combo and they are very comfortable and can be dressed up for work or paired with more casual clothing because of the material. they run a little large and have a lot of stretch so i would size down.,1
"I thought this top was absolutely beautiful! i couldn't wait to get it in but unfortunately it was very big on me. (i'm 5 ft, 105 lbs and got the pxs) the arm holes were so big as well as the overall fit. i'm very disappointed, i really wanted this top to work.",0
Really cute suit but way too small up top. not enough coverage under arms and across bust.i wish retailerpolgie carried bathing suits in the stores so they can be tried on. this is the 2nd suit i have ordered that had to be returned. i wont order a bathing suit again as its just to much of a risk.,0
"I have the blue version. i love the bold, pop art pattern. the colors are strong but neutral enough to pair with a myriad of different options for the top.",1
The length hit at the wrong place for me. lovely knit though so i am very disappointed. it will be going back to the store. interesting muted color that strikes just the right balance. very warm - perfect for fall and winter.,1
"I love this blouse, it's very unique and gorgeous. this blouse is versatile with short, jean and skirt. love it!!!",1
"This lovely skirt absolutely hits the mark for quality. it is a substantial weight for fall, a deep vivid blue color, and just the right length to wear with boots.  it was a trifle snug in the waist. i would have kept it anyway, but the oversized pockets stuck out on either side in an awkward way.  at this price, it just wasn't right for me.",1
"I tried on a regular size at the store, and definitely need petite (5'1.5', 115 lbs). the dress is comfrotbale, and the ivory color gives it a victorian feel. the sleeves are nice a cover the shoulder in a flattrering spot, where hte muscles meet. there is alining, so not see-through. length was too long, why i need petie, also loose-fitting, i would like it more a little more fitted, jsut a bit.",1
"The dress is not the beautiful color in the picture...it is a very yellowish cream. the fabric is thick and does not
hang pretty. very disappointed. had to return it.",0
"Loved this blouse when i received it after ordering online! the cut and style of the blouse is so cute and looks great with jeans. it is well made but it is see-through so i had to wear something under it. otherwise, really flattering, unique design!",1
Cute skort but seems to run big. it's also sort of long for shorts (the model must have much longer legs than me). i may try a size smaller since i love the print but i'm not optimistic.,1
Super comfy skirt!  can't wait to wear it to football games this season!,1
"This dress is gorgeous. more ivory in person. the crochet is amazing. i sized up from my normal s to a m, only bc i wanted a loose fit. and after reading reviews that it fit a little bit like a shift, i wanted a bigger size. but a small would have prob worked as well. depends on how you want this to fit. i love it. i wear mine now w a cropped jean jacket and leggings, soon w just sandals. great transition piece bc it's a slightly heavy dress but not enough to be overwhelming or hot for the summe",1
"I love these jeans! they are really cute and comfy, however, they are way too long. i couldn't believe these were a 33 inch inseam, but i measured them and they are. i am 5'4"" and put on a 4 inch heel and they were still dragging on the ground :( these will have to go back as i don't think the same look can be pulled off if they were hemmed.",0
"The dress is really frumpy standing up. something about the bottom tier of lace just turns it into a frumpy maw-maw nightgown. the lace is really pretty, though",0
"Love, love, love this little lbd!
lots of rich detail and still very easy and laid back. dress up or dress down.
i will be wearing this into the fall season. i purchased the l, still roomy, tried the m but a little snug in the shoulders and chest. i am usually a size 12, d cup. very flattering style boho chic.",1
"These jeans look amazing on. i'm 5'5"" and an hourglass figure and these fit perfectly. if you like high waisted jeans, these are for you! a small heal does need to be worn but i wouldn't say they are excessively long.",1
"I am 5'4"" about 120# with an athletic build. i was so excited for this dress to arrive. when i removed it from the package i loved the way it felt and the weight of it. the color was as pictured on my computer. i ordered the xsp and was concerned it would be too small in the shoulders or too short. it was huge on me -- too long -- too wide -- too frumpy -- too loose all over. i checked to make certain it was a petite that was sent and it was. boo. i do like the cap sleeve better than the flutter",1
"I just tried these on today in the store. i'm 5'5 and found that they were definitely the right length for heels. the 33"" inseam is correct. however, i had them ordered in a petite so i could wear them with flats. these are super cute jeans!!!",1
"I was really excited that they decided to make these. i am a big fan of the tanks and wanted a long sleeve (or even short sleeve - hint!) version of them to wear under suits to work in the winter etc. these do the job nicely - bought ivory and black. other reviewer is right however, something strange in the shoulders as they are quite narrow and the fabric tends to bunch a bit and the arm length is a little strange. i am 5'8 and 150 lbs and order a medium in most retailer stuff and i tend to buy a",1
I love the unique style of this dress. the bell sleeves and the rather fitted body that poofs out at the end put the focus on these details. as for fit ... i'm a standard xs petite and the xsp fits to a tee.,1
"Even at a very deep discount, this piece is definitely not worth the money. the picture made me think this jacket had a longer curved velvet hem as part of its design (which would be cool)--which is largely what attracted me to it, but as i discovered when it arrived, that was actually part of the shirt worn beneath in the photo. so this image is rather misleading. the actual jacket is very thin--more like a shirt with an open front than a jacket. the pockets are just loosely tacked inside. for",0
"I love this dress. i bought this dress in both a m and a s. i was worried about how ""loose"" the dress would fit and also how short it would be. the information about the model wearing the dress only said that she was 5'10"" but not what size dress she was wearing. i am 5'11"" and am in between a dress size 2 or 4. the medium was way too wide, but the small was still long enough with the perfect amount of flow. i purchased the green/slate color, which is more green and has very faint stripes. very",1
This product was offered in a pink color which compliments many color palettes. perfect for layering.,1
"Had high hopes for this seemingly cute skirt to use as a basic in my spring and summer outfits. however, that was not the case. this skirt is not lined and the material is so so. basically, for the price, i was underwhelmed and will return it.",0
Fits true to size and rides the line between contemporary and retro exceptionally well.,1
"I was so excited for this dress to arrive, but when it did, it was a major disappointment. there is no lining on the skirt portion of the dress leaving it sheer. also, the top part along the chest puckered in a weird unflattering way. the colors were beautiful, but not enough to to make up for the other design flaws. i am 5'6"" 140lb and the small fit tts. will be sending it back",0
The malabar moto vest is made of a beautifully soft fabric and is lined on the inside. the added details - pockets and epaulets - are a plus. the vest has snaps and a zipper. the length is just right and the vest has a flattering shape.,1
"Uhm no. oh dear, no. i was initially drawn to this blouse's lovely fabric, the color and pattern are truly stunning. i decided to give it a try because it seemed somewhat boxy, oh boy was i right. sadly, this is one of the least flattering tops that i've ever tried on at retailer. it might be a great maternity top, though.",0
"The photo does a disservice to this beautiful sweater it is truly special with a lace scallop pattern down the front and across to the back. it is absolutely beautiful!! the sweater is lightweight, perfect for a cool day or in an office on a cold day.. i snapped up the grey and may purchase the green if it goes on sale.(unless they can show this sweater off better i am certain it will.) i am usually right between a small and a medium and needed the medium in this sweater. the small was bit tight",1
I ordered my usual size-small. it is perfect because it has enough room to fit a thin shirt or turtleneck underneath when the weather is cooler. the material is very soft. looking forward to a lot of wear out of this vest.,1
"I tried this dress in an xs (my usual size) and it is tts. i love the fabric and pattern and the tiers of the dress are pretty. however, the color kind of washed me out and the neckline made the dress look matronly on me. i didn&#39;t get the dress and wished it worked out.",1
"This shirt fits very closely to the body. it has a very strange fit in the shoulder, though. the arms themselves are really long, far past my hands, yet it's very tight in the shoulder and under arm area. for reference, i am 5'10"", 130 pounds and ordered a small, which is what i usually need.",0
Poor quality. i expected much more from the material.,0
"This is so retailer - pretty in pink, unique design and print. i love origami and i love pink, and this blouse is a perfect combo. i ordered size petite s (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips) and it fits perfectly (the hem falls on the upper hips, just like shown on the model). the top has structure, not too soft and not too stiff. i think the sleeves are very unique and great for those gals who are conscious about their big arms, like me. this top has everything: flair, bright color, unique print, but al",1
Such a pretty pink feminine blouse. love the sleeves! great quality and true to size.,1
Purchased this in green and love the color. it drapes well - not too long on me and hung just past my hips. it has very thin sleeves as other review mentioned to cannot wear anything bulky underneath. overall very happy with this purchase.,1
I got this as a gift and one for me. the medium fits my mom but i got the large because i'm 6'1 and it was large enough but so short waisted. i wouldn't recommend it for women over 5'7,0
This chemise is so comfortable and beautiful. can be dressed up or down and is a staple of a bohemian wardrobe. gave 4 stars for the fact that it is completely see through and requires a (not included) slip underneath. also because the super thin cotton will wear easily.,1
I was not a fan. cute design but the sweater was not soft it felt thick like a weird blanket. the arms were small and the body was big... odd combo. the material didn't make me want to put it on. it went back.,0
"This is way cuter on the model. it runs so big that it is very unflattering. perhaps on someone tall it would look better, but sadly it looked dumpy on my 5'2 frame. it also arrived with some black stain on it. it is going back.",0
"I ordered this in size xl in ivory. it was a drab, poorly-made, too-small sweater. the knit material wasn't good quality and the overall fit didn't work. i liked the light red color and maybe if that had been in stock, then i would have overlooked the problems. but, there are better ivory retailer cardigans available. this was returned.",0
"I wanted this so badly, to wear as a dress over a slip. but it is not cute or flattering when you put it on. it made me look 20 pounds heavier than i am, and the fit was awful. i usually wear an xs in dresses at retailer and this swallowed me. i am petite but this is just waaaaaay too big. so disappointed because it's so pretty.",0
"This dress is very soft and comfy but transparency is an issue. having said that, i think as long as you wear flesh-colored undergarments you'd be fine in a casual situation. the natural fiber is especially comfortable and the detailed stitching around the neck and chest area is pretty. my store didn't have petite sizes and the regular length was too long for me so i passed on it.",1
"After reading the reviews, i ordered an xs and a s in this, though i usually wear an xs in bordeaux. i kept the xs. to me, the sleeves and shoulders run small, while the rest of the shirt is flowy through the torso. i prefer more fitted shirts, but decided this one looked ok. at 5'6"", the hem hit at my hip. i did not find it scratchy at all. in the pink, with a nude bra, it is not terribly see-through, but with a black bra, it is. i washed it in a lingerie bag and laid it flat to dry. maybe it s",1
I like this shirt. it's quite lovely. i ordered it in mint. it's nice to have a dressy t-shirt.,1
It is a great sweater that is soft but also warm i love the pretty design,1
"First of all, the one that looks white is actually a powder blue color. this isn't necessarily bad, but i would have really liked a white one and i was disappointed when it arrived blue. i should have looked more closely at the picture and paid attention to the very unreliable color button on the website.

at any rate, i like this skirt a lot as a causal everyday piece of clothing. in the summers, i tend to wear skirts rather than shorts and am always on the lookout for something that is not t",1
"Very cute jumpsuit, especially for those who want to ease into the jumpsuit style. it looks very much like a dress but is very flattering as a jumpsuit because of the wide legs. the pattern is striking and bold but not garish. it has a low plunging neckline so you may need a camisole underneath (i did!) even though it has padding for those who want to go braless. i purchased a 2p and it fit my 5'3, 115 lbs frame perfectly. i would highly recommend!",1
"Great skirt, fits as expected. very cute, can be dressed up or down. i love the pockets!!",1
"I've seriously been on the hunt for a olive green military-ish style skirt for a couple years now and i think i've found it! the color is great! the finishings are cool(rose gold buttons!) i actually like the a-line, it give me room to sit down without riding up. the waist is pretty fitted, verging on tight and i ordered an 8. i'm usually a 6 or 8 in bottoms, but i need to trim off a few pounds from a recent vaca! so i'm keeping the 8, it will probably be perfect soon enough! the length is just",1
"I'm 5'2"", weigh 120 lb.. i ordered p6 and found the torso too short. if i bent forward or kneeled down that fabric would ride ride up into my butt big time. the top was a little loose too. i'm 35ab cup. i love the colors and geometric design. sadly i have to return.",1
I bought this in navy - it is absolutely stunning and looks like a dress on. super flattering and i don't even need to wear a bra with it,1
"Love these pants, and will wear them all season like a uniform. but, the quality is a little low. made in china, and the black dye may be coming off on white clothes and my skin. i haven't washed them yet, and a little scared to. super comfy, stretchy and still classy despite the quality issues.",1
"I ordered the mustard shade in size xl. it is so well-made & comfortable. the patterned lining makes it extra cute and extra soft to wear. it's washed well too. i like the shorter length. it it fun to play with proportions when using it. i ordered the navy in xl since i've gotten such great use out of the yellow one. it hasn't shed/pilled either. well-made, quirky and useful for layering!",1
"I bought these assuming they would be the same as a pair of pilcro stet ankle jeans i bought a couple of years ago. this pair has less stretch than my older ones, so they are a bit tighter. i'm 5'2"" and these are more like a perfect length regular jean (rather than ankle). i always have trouble finding jeans that fit my curves, but smaller waist. these are a bit big in the waist, with the butt and legs fitted. all-in-all they are a nice looking durable denim that flatters.",1
"I really loved this skirt on the model, but it just wasn't flattering when i received my order. i ordered two sizes - 2 and 4. i am 5'4, athletic build and the front closure made my waist look much larger than it is. the back of the skirt also flared out more than i expected it to. 

sadly, i had to return both. perhaps this would look better on someone with a much taller frame.",0
"If you're a little afraid to rock a jumpsuit this one's for you. the palazzo leg makes it look a lot like a dress. a light shelf bra was very supportive even for my d/dd cup. it does run large. i'm typically a 14/16 and was easily able to fit in the 12, although the look it a bit racier on me due to cleavage. hides any tummy you might have very well due to the flowing cut. the fabric is light and comfortable. my only complaint is i wish it was a tad longer. i can not wait to rock this at a weddi",1
This was so boxy and unflattering. i loved the lining and the fabric was very soft but it looked like i was wearing a bag. was hoping to use this as a cute top layer for dresses but it was a terrible fit. sizing down would not help this one. went back!,0
I ordered these a size up because i'd just had a baby and knew i needed a bigger size. my pre-pre baby size (chubby phase) were size 8/29. these fit like a size 4. way too small. very disappointed!,0
"This shirt is beautiful, however i thought that it was made of a softer, lighter material. it is, instead, made of a thick, heavy material that was unflattering for my shape. ( short torso ann's large bust) it made me look boxy and chunky in the middle. sadly, i'll be returning it.",1
"I have purchased many different styles of pilcro jeans, and have loved them all!!! these, unfortunately i do not like. i think they run large and the fit, just blah. the waist gapped and kinda had a ""mom jean"" look. i felt the quality was also not up to standard for this brand.",0
I was disappointed in the blue color of this skirt. i was looking for white. also felt it ran a little big.,1
"I am not particularly fond of this skirt - it is good quality and nice color but i expected material to be little bit more substantial, it is too ""limp"" for my taste, but if you prefer very soft and ""worn in"" feeling, it might work great for you. also, i prefer wearing my ts over the skirt (not inside) and since waistband is very elaborate and is followed with thick buttons right below, it just looks funny under thin summer t-shirts : /. overall, just not working for me, but skirt is cute and tr",1
"This jumpsuit runs large so i sized down perfectly one full size down. i have a size b chest and was very comfortable with no bra, as the built in cups gave me the perfect coverage. it looked like a dress standing, but had such a flattering and fun shape when you move. everyone loved it!",0
"Loved the color and the deshn. but when i put on, did not look right. waist was too short and the arms were long.",0
"As others have said, this is cropped, so will look funny with most pants that aren't high waisted. i'm going to try it with a few dresses before i return it. the lining is adorable, so i don't want to have to send it back.",0
"I am so happy i splurged and bought these jeans. based on the other reviewer, i ordered one size up, and they fit perfectly. i'm 5'8 and appreciate the longer inseam. i can't wear a wedge heel or anything with them, but with a flat on they skim the floor perfectly. you'll love the raw hemline and the subtle ""wear"" throughout the fabric. it's not overdone. just like in the picture, they really seem to narrow the hip, think page boy style. very, very flattering!",1
I really like the pilcro serif style but the stet style does not work for my body. will have to return.,0
"I like the detail in this cardigan. the shape is true to the fit on the model of the main picture, the sleeves are a bit long, however i am 5'2.5 and 107 lbs, i ordered and kept the xxsp. great staple item!",1
"The is such a cute a-line skirt and perfect for the summer with a white tee. i bought the moss color and the rose gold buttons on it look really pretty. i'm 5'1 ,103 pounds and bought the 00 regular since i did not want to go too short with the petite size. it does run slightly big so order a size down if you have a smaller waist. love this and the price!",1
"I just bought this in the yellow and am very pleased!!! the sleeves are super long but i'm happy about that! usually, they are much too short, this is much cozier! this will look cute over dresses and with jeans and a longer/tunic style top. nice quality too",1
I loved the color of these but they bagged out with just one wear. they are going back to store.,0
This skirt makes me look at least a size smaller. i love it! the sa was wearing it in the store and it liked great on her as well with just a plain white top. tts- got my usual 10 in green.,1
"I really like the color of this and the feel, but that is where it ends. it does not come with the gorgeous flattering belt that it is pictured with, and is cut without shape so it does not fit to your body and show off any glorious womanly curves. i could purchase the belt with it, but i don't prefer to purchase products that cannot stand on their own.",0
"I think this top would have been amazing if it was in a jersey or cotton club but the gauzey fabric is so wrinkly and so sheer i don't know how i would use this top. i don't mind most of the slightly sheer retailer tops (if people see my bra slightly so be it) but this is really sheer, unless you are madonna you are going to want to wear something under this, and in my mind, that defeats the purpose of a lightweight, sleeveless top. i returned it and was sorry to have to do that.",0
"Runs a bit small, but this top is super soft like all the cloth and stone tops. great for all seasons!!",1
"I'm not a western girl but this dress is so adorable. i love the colors, it's adorable and unique. while its definitely a full swingy shirt dress i didn't find it overly large. i plan on wearing as a dress with sleeves rolled up. under the pilcro denim jacket it looks so cute. and open over jeans with a white tank like a jacket.",1
"I am not sure who in the world could really wear this as a dress without belting it...definitely a super weird cut. extreme a-frame. the fabric is just absolutely gorgeous and it is so well made otherwise. i thought about trying to size down but it would be too small in the shoulders for sure. i am going to keep anyway. i've already worn it with jeans and a t-shirt and as a topper with a denim shirt dress. it actually looked fantastic with both. i'll get a lot of wear out of it, just not the way",1
"I love the color patterns and fabric.  it has full lining!  my biggest problem with the dress is the swing style - makes it more like a maternity dress and so unflattering?  a straight (shift) style would have been much better.  dress runs large, however the arm/shoulder area is tight.",0
"This is a very cute fall dress that can be worn in a myriad of styles. from styling it with a pair of wedges and dark tights, to donning a bolo and ankle boots, heads will turn when you walk into the room.",1
I bought these pants for my girlfriend for christmas. she really loved them! the material the pants are made of is very comfortable. the animals are super cute too.,1
"Just got these today because they were a steal of a deal with the sale on sale. was super excited because the pattern is adorable! i put them on tonight and noticed that they, firstly, aren't eloise like i assumed they would be, and secondly, that they weren't as soft as i had expected. all of the retailer/eloise pajamas i have purchased in the past have been so soft and comfortable - you don't want to take them off! did i get an off pair that just happened to not be as soft? i'm not sure, but i'm",0
"I'm a 36ddd, and have a bust about 42"" so when i tried this on in a size 12, i honestly didn't expect to be able to squeeze it on... and yet i had inches upon inches to spare in the bust. this really is built more like a tent than a dress. on the bright side though, if you belt it, and gather the extra material at the sides it'll define your waist and the skirt has lots of swing and flounce to it. i do love a line styles!! 

i found i had to roll up the sleeves otherwise the dress looked too s",1
It is a beautiful top but runs huge!!! i followed other reviews and ordered a size down hoping it would work but it was totally unflattering! i wanted so bad to love it but there was no way i could keep it!!,0
"Based on the other reviews, i sized down from my usual 6p to a 2p, but this dress was still ridiculously huge and extremely unflattering. i could tell the minute i took it out of the package it wouldn't work. i can't imagine this would flatter very many people. the front photo of the model is incredibly deceptive. very disappointed--this will be going back for sure.",0
"Larger than life in both size and personality. this one runs pretty big however the detailing in the fabric itself and embroidered collar balance that out. it's even more gorgeous in person!

"This dress is loose, unique, and super cute! you'll get noticed in this dress! i ordered down a size.",1
"I tried this shirt in a small (my usual retailer size) and it was very unflattering.   the fabric was ultra soft and it seemed it was nicely made.  however, this shirt is so unstructured and oversized, i might as well worn a brown paper bag.",0
"Based on the strength of the other reviews, i thought this sweater would be amazing, but i was disappointed. the knit is very thin, cheap looking and weak that it won't last a season undamaged. it reminds me of a duster i bought 15 years ago at a discount fast-fashion retailer when i was a student. sloppy looking with lots of creases out of the package. collar is odd and the sleeve openings have an annoying flare. the drape is not structured enough--everything about this screams over priced bath",0
"I had this on my birthday list and was really hopeful that it'd work out based on all of the good reviews. when i got it, i was happy with the fit and fabric, but i was stumped as to what i'd wear it with. it hung in the closet for a couple of weeks because i just didn't know if i could pull off the length. i took the plunge today and find it pairs nicely with a flared leg pant and simple shirt underneath. it's so stretchy, warm, and cozy! the sweater does shed as another reviewer mentioned so k",1
"I love the design of these. the laser cut outs are solid and hold up in the wash. they are great for work-outs and cute enough to wear as leggings out. i wore them to my bar method class, came home and just changed my top and continued wearing them the rest of the day as a cute outfit. they have a great snug fit and the fabric is thick and durable.",1
"I ordered the gold in size xl. it fits true to size, matching the online photos. the color & details are prettier in person. such a comfortable tee. it's washed/dried well too. i hope they make more colors for this fall. it's been a great basic!",1
Didn't notice the zipper in the back when i ordered this so it was a nice surprise,1
"I initially bought this dress to wear to an interview that required something casual, yet could be dressed up with interesting jewelry. although i ended up wearing another black dress, i kept this.  paired with interesting black booties and a great necklace, this dress is easy to wear  - and stylish. most importantly, comfortable. i could see myself wearing this on days that i feel inspired to dress up, but want to wear something that is not fussy. and, the pockets!",1
"Very pretty but runs tight - i usually wear an 8 or small/med in retailer jackets and couldn't zip up the 8 (am a 36c and thick/broad at the top) as there is no give. this is also more like a fitted shirt, made of lightweight muslin-like fabric. was looking for a summer jacket to wear over knits in a chilly, air conditioned office setting so sadly it didn't work for me. could be cute on someone with a smaller frame over a tank or cami.",0
"I am obsessed with this shirt! it's sooooo comfy and soft, like wearing a blanket! perfect for throwing over yoga clothes. comfy yet adorable.",1
"I never leave reviews for anything but this dress was such a complete miss. first off, it's about 3 sizes too big. second off, it's knitted with a metallic thread that you can't really notice in the picture. i'm usually a medium and feel an xs would be sufficient.",0
"I like this sweater very much. it's short but not too short, and soft but not fluffy. the design is a little interesting rather than plain and the colors (i ordered the tan) are great for me, a redhead. i'm 5'3"", 125 lbs and don't like clingy tops so i took a m and it's perfect. really cutewith jeans.",1
I would highly recommend this top. it is beautiful and it helps to hide problem areas. much prettier than the picture depicts. i am very happy with this purchase. can't wait to wear with black or white capris this summer.,1
Very flattering on. fitted on top with a loose swingy bottom. like most retailer tops it does run a little big. i would size down if between sizes. the material does seem a little fragile so i'm not sure how it will hold up. i like the look/fit enough that i may get a 2nd color.,1
"The jeans look so different online! the pair i got did not have the stone washed look and was completely different cut. the rise is not as stated and is actually 10.5 inches! also, i'm a true 25 and the waist is like a 27, but the legs are super skinny. i'm so disappointed and i'm not even sure if is worth swapping out for a smaller size. these look more like men's cut jeans.",0
I love this jacket. i have worn it twice and gotten compliments both times. the details on the sleeves are so unique and interesting. it fits tts. i am typically an xl and i ordered that size- i can wear a long sleeve collared shirt underneath so it is perfect for me. the pictures on the website don't do it justice. it looks much nicer in person.,1
I ordered this online and was disappointed when it arrived. it didn't look quite like it does in the photos online. it also runs small. i returned it because i did not feel it was worth the high price.,0
Only one sleeve is folded twice and sewed. meh.,0
"I really love this top. it's cute, whimsical, and comfy. i received many compliments on it. it's a really good length and good quality. happy i purchased it, especially during the tag sale.",1
"Sleepwear is always hit or miss with me. i am 5' 8"" and curvy, and typically sleep pants hit right above my foot and aren't long enough. or they stretch out after a few wearings and look baggy or unflattering. however, this pair exceeded all my expectations! first, they are just plain pretty. the pattern and colors are lovely. the blue at the ankle is a cute touch. the fabric is soft and slightly drapey - but substantial enough for warmth and not see-through at all. i also like how the waist is",1
"This shirt is amazing. it's soft, comfortable. i can't speak yet as to how well it will hold up but i plan on wearing it a lot. the cut is great, the shirt flutters away from under the empire waist line and the nylon patch in the back, creating a flattering shape without clinging anywhere. the sleeves are nice, long, and fitted.

this shirt will work great as a winter/fall basic piece but the texture, color, and contrast detail in the back make it interesting on its own. very versatile.

Does not look like the picture. lined with a cheap denim fabric inside that shows when arms are rolled up. i normally always fit in mediums and this jacket is so small in the arms as well as body that it fit like a xs.,0
Super comfortable and on trend with the embroidery and beading - wore it day after i received to the airport over tee shirt & jeans and got compliments left and right - love it!!,1
"I ordered this sweater online in a size 12. i am 5'7 170 i normally wear a 10/12, i was swimming in this one. i could have ordered an 8 and been fine. the fabric feels luxurious but the twist in the shoulder is not sewn into place, you will have to steam/press it each time you wear it or you could have it sewed into place.",1
"Well made but strange fit. the medium was long and narrow, waaay too small.",0
A fabulous light weight jacket. love the detail and fit is perfect and comfortable. the jacket was not so interesting on the display table but once tried on it became mine and i suspect this is going to sell out. i really love the light color denim trim on the lapels. a keeper!  i purchased a medium and that is my standard size in retailer jackets.  for reference: 34 dd  and 145 pounds and 5'4 height.,1
"Like a previous reviewer mentioned the jeans do not necessarily look like the one in the photo. i first ordered them in my regular size and also had to notice that they are cut like men's jeans with legs so skinny that i could only force them over my calves. the embroiding is beautiful, but it also stops the material from stretching, so the the super skinny legs are a real problem. also, they are not as intensely stone washed as shown in the picture. i decided to order them again one size bigger",0
"Although the weather is getting warm in ca, the gold color and cut of this shirt made me want to buy just one more long sleeved item--and it didn't disappoint! i'm actually looking forward to next winter so i can wear it again!",1
"Much to my surprise when i tried on this sweater i found that it was cut in a bell shape and not at all fitted or straight like in the photo. when i pulled it out of the package i thought i'd ordered the wrong size because the shoulders looked so narrow. but when i tried it on the shoulders fit perfectly, with beautiful detail and high quality material, but the sweater belling out to a very wide shape. it is very wide at the hip and looks out of proportion. it doesn't look anything like the phot",0
"This top fits like shown in the pictures. however, i bought the rose color and thought it was a little ""off"". would have loved to find the ivory in my size.",1
"I love these pants. only wish they i was a little taller, i'm 5'4"" and the small is a little long for me.",1
"This is one of my favorite retailer dresses - it's flowy and makes me feel beautiful. i loved it so much that i bought it in two colors! it does run big, so i would size down but when you find your size, you'll love it!",1
"I really liked the dress on line, but, i didn't appreciate how lovely it was until i received it. it fit perfectly, and has a lovely flare at the hemline for a flirty feel. i wear it with taupe colored booties and it is perfect for work and afterwork.",1
"I'm in love with this dress! i have seen the chevron pattern of this dress on many women and i can honestly say that i haven't seen a body that it doesn't look good on. i am a busty girl and was afraid the shape of this dress would make me look as if i was expecting and much to my surprise it didn't at all. this is such a great transitional piece to have in your closet, i highly recommend it!",1
"This is a great summer dress. i bought this dress in both l and xl because this brand varies. i kept the l because the fit was better. the xl was wider and had larger armholes the fabric and colors are beautiful. lots of compliments, it is lined, highly recommend.",1
"I order the blue and orange endora wing dress in an xxs and it was still very large. i know that this is a flow dress but there was so much excess material that i looked like i was swallowed. the colors are more muted than in the pictures, a faded blue and orange that i didn't really like. return.",0
"I love deletta and regularly search for their items here on retailer. however, this one is a miss as i think it runs small or you need to be taller and thinner then i for the gathering, opening to hit you right. i did really like the color ( ordered the brown) and material but back it goes.",0
"I wanted to love this blouse so much. but try as i might, it just fit so oddly on me. i'm usually a petite s so i purchased the xs in brown. first. the color was more gray-brown but it was still ok. but second, the fit was off. maybe i just got a bad one, but the center of the blouse was so offset, that the slit in the front laid so far to the left and the v-neck was so low that you could see my bra - there was no adjusting i could do to fix it. the material has a lovely soft silky feel to it an",0
"I was so excited about this dress. but when i got it, there were several issues i had with it. the neck is just too high for me and the skirt is too pleated and makes my hips look wide. i was hoping for more of an a-line cut. gorgeous though! wish it worked.....",1
"This dress is beautiful - it is just as pretty as it looks in the picture, if not prettier. it is a great material, the colors are beautiful, and it is perfect to throw on in the summer. i highly recommend it.",1
"This fell apart after wearing it once. for the price, it should hold up better. it's too delicate.",0
I wasn't sure about this top but i had a feeling i needed to at least try it on. it drapes so beautifully and the keyhole neck is a lovely little touch. i love the asymmetric hemline and the fabric is incredibly soft. as far as the fit goes i found that it did run slightly small.,1
"Very disappointed. ordered two sizes, the fraying of the embroidery was so bad on one of the dresses i wouldn't have worn it and the zipper was sticking. the second dress had fraying and loose threads as well and the seams at the shoulders were not properly sewn which made the lace at the neckline completely crooked. some of these issues would maybe be acceptable if the dress was under $100 but at $228 they are not. returning both sizes.",0
I love the look of this dress and i love the way it is cut. the one thing i do not love is the thickness of the material. it is just too much for a summer dress. it just felt heavy and hot. i still love this brand so i am hopeful for a few more great options to come out before summer is over.,0
"This dress is so flattering, i had wanted to try it on for awhile. when it hit sale w/ additional % off i headed to my local store. the dress fits like a dream, so darn cute for summer, in cali we have a lot of summer left. this dress pairs perfectly with the gretta espadrilles. my usual size small was perfect. hurry and get this perfect dress before it sells out!",1
"As a petite, big busted woman, i found this dress wildly unflattering. the quality and pattern of the dress itself is beautiful, though it will require a slip as it is completely transparent. the design of the bust however, i found unflattering.",0
"I was looking for an undergarment and this is more of a nightgown.
if it came in a solid color then i'd probably buy it.
i usually wear a small and this was a tad too tight.
on the upside, the fabric was soft and lightweight.",0
"I saw this in the store and decided to try it on. it is so pretty. the fit is perfect. i didn't think that i would like it due to the sequins on the front. when i put it on, i didn't mind them at all. it really is a beautiful dress with beautiful colors. dry clean only is the only drawback to this one.",1
"I understand the style of this dress is ""swing"", but there is just so much fabric, and it looked a bit like a tent on me. i ordered the s and i just found it to be too loose all over. the fabric is great and the colors are rich and lovely. this style would probably look better on someone smaller-chested, because there is no waist, it falls out from the bustline. cute dress, but i would size down.",0
"A good part of my closet is filled with retailer clothes. i mix them with my basics, scarves and jewelry. so, i immediately thought of a dozen ways this kimono could jazz up anything from skinny jeans to slip dresses, even though i felt it was pretty pricey. when it arrived, i was more than disappointed in the cheapness of the fabric. it does nothing for any of my intended clothes, so it is going back asap.",0
"This dress is gorgeous, flattering, oood quality and, in my opinion, better than the erin fetherston dress because of the black, rather than nude liner, which really brought our the beautiful embroidery. come on, practically everything in rtw is a knockoff of something. i do have to comment that the slip is quite snug, though, but at least it's stretchy. that being said, it still had a bit of a tendency to creep up. i was glad i had a black half slip on as well. the fit is tts but a bit short wa",1
Saw this in the store and just had to have it. beautiful design. fits perfectly. looks nice with a belt as well.,1
"This is one fabulous-looking dress; however, the really scratchy neckline at the lace edge was a deal-breaker for me. i even tried sizing up, to see if that would help, but it was still too scratchy for me.",0
"Count me in as a five star lover of this dress! the details are so rich and interesting, so be prepared to get noticed when wearing. i'm happy to say that getting the size medium regular (instead of petite) was a good choice for my top heavy frame. the chest is fitted but not tight, the length is a not-too-short above knee, the tiered layers swing so nicely, and the beads/sequins add a touch is whimsy to the design. my one negative is the tassels at the neck tie--soo heavy cumbersome to style. o",1
Love this tunic...and so do others! so many compliments already!! i've worn it with skinny jeans as well as flowy black pants. it needs a cami underneath since it's sheer. i also like to wear it with my long retailer necklaces!,1
"If it's a knock off, its of the ""poise"" dress, and a pretty good one at that. this is a beautiful dress that took my breath away the moment i saw it. when i saw such a poor rating i just had to see why. the erin fetherston dress is over $100 more and they look just about the same. i'd rather have the $ and the look!",1
This dress is navy and neutral stripes. not black and white. it fits true to the size width wise but is 2-3 inches shorter than the picture. to gain the length you might want to size up but it will be wider. the knot at the hip is beautiful and very flattering.,1
"I was really excited for this top to arrive and was really disappointed once i tried it on. i am sure this is a gorgeous top on someone with a straighter or more slender frame. it is good quality and looks fine on the hanger. i think the color in the picture online accurately shows the color. ladies with hips or a booty, beware...this looked horrible on me! it clung to my butt and didn't hang nice and straight like it does in this picture. i expected the fabric to have a little give to it but it",0
I had this in my cart for a while online and ended up finding it in store. the medium fit good and looked great. i can't wait to wear it with a great pair of leggings. i did have to buy some static spray as it was sticking to my leggings i had on that day buying it.,1
Loved loved loved the shirt but...the material was so thin,0
"I love these jeans. the wash is nice enough for work. they fit well around the waist and have just the right mid-rise height, to make them stylish- not mom jeans at all. i am a pilcro convert. very comfortable too.",1
"I agree with other reviewer, the material of these jeans is not the same! thin, stretches, and you end up pulling them up all the time. i am a short, curvy girl and would love to have the old jean fabric back! this seems to be the trend in jeans?nydj also uses this fabric?stretches too much.",0
"This tunic is a lighter weight knit that isn't bulky to wear under coats, etc. it has grey shades running through the natural color which gives the knit more depth. it has a flattering fit. i bought it in the petite size and the length is perfect. i like the way the knit pattern runs two different directions in the front. it adds more interest to the look.",1
"When i first saw this shirt in person i was shocked because the lines on it are sparkly and colorful.  now that i look closely at the shirt online i see that, but i did not expect it cause it wasn't as obvious in the online photos.  it is much more prominent in person.
i ordered it in my usual size and it fits perfectly - just like the model, definitely oversized but appropriately so.  the length was also great (i'm 5'8) which made me very happy.",1
"This shirt arrived today, and i was surprised how short it is. not a tunic at all. i wonder if the lengths on these vary, and if i order it again, it would be a different length. i ordered my normal size, xs petite. i'm 5-2"", so this should have been a tunic on me. perhaps if i see this shirt in the store, i'll try on the regular length. i'm returning the petite!",0
"This fits like a regular top for me. i can take petite on top most of the time. i bought this in a medium regular and it fits like my regular high low tees or tops. i think it's so cute on. it's light weight enough for warmer weather. i'm going to love it this spring/summer and into fall with a jacket or cardigan. another plus is it doesn't gape at the armpit which i get sometimes with regular cuts. it's not so low cut on me either, but i have a 32f (37-38ish inches) bust so that may be why? it",1
"I had read a few reviews on this shirt before ordering that said it ran small and was shorter than it looks. i thought it was worth finding out because i really liked how this shirt looks in the pictures on the store site. unfortunately, when i got it in the mail and opened it up i found out that all the earlier review were right.

it is much shorter than the dimensions implied in the pictures of the model. i was expecting a tunic style shirt that could be worn over leggings or skinny jeans th",0
"This dress is great! it's perfect for a casual look with a denim jacket, comfortable for traveling, and can even be dressed up for a more formal occasion. i wore it on a cross country flight (toronto-british columbia) and was so comfortable with a sweater and scarf to wrap around me if i got cold. the only con i found of this dress is the back is a bit low leaving your bra showing and being a 32-d i don't feel comfortable going without a bra. i purchased a few of the bralettes to go with it to m",1
This top is just amazing. it does run large so size down but fit and feel is wonderful especially if you would like to hide some lumps and bumps this is the perfect top.,1
"I love this top. the material is soft but good quality and not flimsy. the cut is fitted and flattering. the color of the fabric is ivory, not bright white. the embroidery is a good quality and doesn't easily fray. the fit is true to size. i highly recommend this top. i wear it with jeans and it looks really cute, always get compliments. it's very comfortable too.",1
"This blouse is sumptuous! the fabric is soooo soft, embroidery beautiful, fit flattering. sadly i returned it due to the color. i mostly shop on-line due to time restriction, and the picture looks to be a winter white to me. it is a light yellow color, most pleasing with the cobalt embroidery. alas, any shade of yellow makes my skin look jaundice - so back it had to go.",1
"Based on other reviews i had no doubt this dress would be perfect.  it truly is a work of art, however it just wasn't ""me"" when i tried it on.  i'm sure for others it will be perfect.  my biggest issues were the sheerness of the top portion, which is obvious in the photos.  i was hoping it would be less obvious in person.  also the elbows of the dress were tight, so it was difficult to bend my arms, and i have pretty slender arms.",1
"Nice jacket, good quality, flattering design. i'm 5""4"", 115 lbs, bought a size s and fits well. love the hood. a little snug in the arms if you want to wear a long sleeve underneath. overall a good buy!",1
"Got this for my daughter for christmas. she loves the ""boho peasant"" look. i thought the fabric would be white or at least cream color but it was closer to pale yellow. although the fabric quality and texture is lovely (more substantive than i expected) , she just couldn't like the top with the color being so off.
disappointing as picture makes it much prettier.",0
"I ordered a size xl. it's flowy so it could be running larger but since the fit in the shoulders/neck/sleeves matches the model, i think it's true-to-size for the design. it is so comfortable. i love the softness of the material. the problem for me is the color. on my monitor, it looks like a light ivory or white. but, the embroidered lace bib portion is a darker ivory shade that doesn't work for my complexion so i'll be returning mine. everything is well-made though, especially the vintage-styl",1
"The floral pattern on this tank tranforms it to a beautiful piece.  i usually tend to avoid top with full pattern because it tends to look busy, but not with this top.  i'm usually wear s/m with retailer brand depending with the design.  this tank has loose bottom section, so the s is tts for me.",1
"This top is cut too short & wide with too much light material in between. to be truly slimming & flattering, it needs to have more of the rayon/spandex blend, to make it heavier & bouncier. then it would ""hang"" appropriately and ""swing"" and (hopefully) not add pounds to the wearer. unfortunately this top is too lightweight & has too much material. pass.",0
I purchased this top over the weekend and absolutely love it. i am currently 9 months pregnant (due in a week) and this top is perfect bc it has plenty of length. it is super soft and comfortable for the texas heat. i am 5'6'' usually 115 lbs currently closer to 140 lbs.,1
I really wanted to like this shirt the quality is amazing and much prettier in person but it is hard to take care of. if you wash it the wrinkles are horrible so it has to be dry clean only. also the back is ridiculously long it looks very odd from the side view.,0
"I originally bought this in medium, my normal size. when it arrived, it was absolutely huge, like wearing teepee. i took it back to the store, and re ordered a small, in the black, and now it fits great. this is a great shirt, but giving four stars due to the inconvenience.",1
"This piece is lovely if you do not plan to use your arms, or if you are a t-rex. if you are not a mannequin or a dinosaur and actually plan to use your arms, this top may not be for you.",0
"I'm a teacher and am always looking for easy to wear pieces that will also work for my job. i also walk in to campus with my backpack, so i need something that looks good but is comfortable. 
this dress drapes beautifully, is really soft, and has a wide, flattering neckline. i'm short and chose the regular size instead of petite so that it would hit right at the knee. it's definitely on the generous side: i usually wear an s and i sized down to an xs.
i can definitely see getting a lot of wear",1
"I came to retailer just to browse and came across this dress. i almost didn't get it because it looked very big. however, i tried it on, and fell in love with it. it does run a little wide, but the length is good, and it is very comfortable. it is perfect for the summer months.",1
"This is such a beautiful top. i sized down from a large to medium and it fits but too long and full for my shape. also found the armholes too deep and revealing for my large bust. sadly, returning.",1
This top is soft and comfortable without being some shapeless drag with too much fabric. i did size down as did the other woman in the store with me. i can see many more wears out of this top. wish it had been made in other colors or white would be beautiful!,1
"I loved the colors (especially the pink) and thought this would be really pretty. however, when i received it, its much shinier with is a very thin material and is a bit of a retro in a not nice way feel to it. i also found it huge. normally, i wear an xxsp or a 00p (for reference i am 5'2, 30e and 24 in waist. i tried both the xxsp (fit better but was too short) and the xxs (too large). i had hoped this would have more shape and would be more fitted, but its definitely not.",0
The print is beautiful and the detail on the chest is so pretty. th fabric is a soft t-shirt martial. i ordered a medium and it fits like a large. it is supposed to be flowy and loose though. overall i feel beautiful in it. great for our hot humid charleston summers!,1
"I tried this shirt on on a whim in my local store when i was there to shop the sale items an to my surprise, it was very flattering and comfortable. it had a unique fit and design; i tried on the black in an xs (my usual size) and surprisingly, i didn't find it to be too big at all. it fit just like it did on the model. you could almost wear it as a mini dress over leggings/shorts based on the length. like one of the previous reviewers, it would be great if it came in other colors. this top woul",1
"This is so beautiful! i loved it online, but it's even prettier in person. it's a little greener than it appears in the photo. the straps are actually a green rather than white. i'm 5' 6'' 123 lbs and the xs fits perfectly. worth the money!",1
"The fabric and style on this swing tee are really nice but be aware it runs really, really large. i downsized on my order because of the style but it wasn't enough. like wearing a tent. i would recommend it but know its very full. i did return it.",1
"This top is super comfortable and has a great preppy casual look. i have been wearing it on weekends with jeans, but could also pair it with a skirt and tights to have a more work type look. i don't usually like the shorter length shirts, but the fit on this works for me.",1
"Saw this online and didn't catch my attention, but saw it in store and decided to try it on. really cute and comfy on. the fabric feels so soft. it runs very big.",1
"The body is huge, while the arms fit. being returned!",0
"This is the reason i doggedly fight for items at retailer as there are often maybe 6 made in my xxsp.

you really have to see this in person. even the slip could be worn as a chemise alone with the double layer and dots. the colors are gorgeous. i wanted this to try with my burgundy velvet blazer (and it works withe the copper color - too).

"I have always had a thing for velvet, and velvet pants are hard to come by so i was so pleased to see these and i rushed to order a pair in the dark turquoise. they are beautiful; exactly as pictured, but a bit longer in length on me. i am 5'3"". they can be dressed up, but what is so fun about them is that they can easily be dressed down as well. i am wearing them with a heather-grey t-shirt. they also pair well with the metallic linen tees. my one and only criticism is that they are a bit wide",1
This is one of my favorite retailer dresses of all time. it is soo much better in person and on than the stock photos. very romantic and fun.,1
"Frustrated that the details don't mention there's a side zip. for whatever reason, i have the hardest time fitting into dresses with side zips and so i was annoyed that the details say it's a pull-on style when that's not the case. there's also no give in the waist. besides the fit not working for me, it was a pretty dress but overall a little too much going on.",0
"This is figure featuring without being too tight. it fits exactly like the picture. it is a bit pricey, but can be dressed up or dressed down and is perfect for hot summer days as well as worn with a cardigan. i love it!",1
"I bought this in size xl. it ran much shorter & smaller than is typical for this brand. i found the arms tighter on me compared to the model's photos. the lace itself was pretty, intricate and washed well. i wish this shirt had worked but i ended up donating it after wearing it a couple times. the cropped length and close-fit just didn't work on me. i thought the sleeve shape was pretty. with just a little more material, this would have been a favorite. i hope it works well on whoever receives i",0
"I don't have anything like it in my closet, really excited to wear it",1

yes!",1
"These pants look beautiful when you first see them. it goes downhill from there. the waist is very small in relation to the rest of the pants. it felt fine when pulled up, but it is a struggle. i could get past that, but when i looked in the mirror, i could see right through them. no lining and not very thick material for this price!!! a real bummer, especially since it was a birthday gift.",0
"This skirt could not be more comfortable. and the colors are great--nice and vibrant. i got compliments on it the first day i wore it. the only problem is it fits larger than i thought it would--it's really stretchy fabric too. i'm a little curvy on the bottom and am short waisted, so i opted for a medium. i should have ordered the small. but it still works.

the other thing that's nice is that for short people like me (i""m between 5'2"" and 5'3"") it doesn't drag on the ground; in fact it fits me",1
"This dress has beautiful lines. i loved the design on the material, but the fabric looked very cheap & even was already snagged when it arrived. unfortunately, i must return it.",0
Classy pants that can look casual or sophisticated. my husband loves them on me. for a dinner out i dressed them up with a top from retailer. i think these will be a must on my trip to florida this winter since the pants will look great with a t.,1
"I really wanted to love this cardigan and did until i tried it on. the arms are so tight! i ordered in a m, which is my normal retailer size, but couldn't move my arms. took it back, was going to try in a l, but store didn't have any. for the price, i need to be able to move my arms!",0
"I bought this dress online last week (in large part based on all the positive reviews), then i saw it in the store. i didn't try it on because it was already on the way to me and i had ordered a petite anyway and the store didn't carry petites. i have to say when i saw it hanging in the store i was disappointed! for some reason i didn't realize it was a sweater dress and it looked frumpy on the hanger. so i had resigned myself to returning it once i received it. well it came today and i figured",1
"This is a beautiful cardigan. its effortless, lightweight, with some cool detail to keep that low key look extra stylish. the moss color is very subtle with a small lined print. i wanted to love this...the detail, the length, the weight and the color are all so dreamy...but for me, the arms were super tight. normally i'm a l or xl in all retailer tops and sweaters...and i do have larger arms which is always a struggle for me when shopping. i couldn't even get the cardigan on my arms. there is no s",1
I was very excited about this dress but when it came i saw it had too much going on. it either needs the ruffle taken away ( my first choice) or the halter part taken away. in the end i think it needs to go back.,0
I was excited to order this dress based on the reviews. it was better than i expected. the fit is perfect and one of the most comfortable dresses i own. the fit is flattering and i will get plenty of use out of this one!,1
"The color is a nice cool red and the material is very soft. but the dress left me feeling shapeless and the bell sleeve overtook it. i wanted to love it, but it just wasn't working for me. i'm 5'8"" and purchased a s. it fits true to size, however it was loose around the waist and just wasn't complimentary on me. this will have to go back.",0
"Overall a very nice and unique dress. it does have too much going on, but can be worn in a versatile way, and if you are small chested, without a bra. i am not a big fan of the material, i wish it was softer. it definitely has a gypsie/bohemian look if that is what you are looking for!",1
"I know i will be wearing this a lot! i wore it on tuesday for work with some dressier pants and opened, i wore it on sat and sun for long walks :) great piece",1
"This is a lovely dress and exceeded all of my expectations. very unique and well-made. swing dresses can be a hit or miss, sometimes, but this one is perfect. couldn't be happier!",1
I love the quality and colors of this romper; however i have a long torso and the top part was just too short for my body style. it made the bottom part pull as well. overall the fit just wasn't right for me. i did love the material and it is a very nice piece.,0
"Everyone should have this blouse, amazing! simply love it! it does run large, so purchase down 1-2 sizes.",1
This shirt fits really well- i ordered a size small and it's definitely a bit form fitting. i was a little bit hesitant to purchase this at first- for a tshirt it's a pretty hefty price. but the quality and cut are really quite attractive and worth every penny.,1
"This dress looked adorable online, but unfortunately, it's not flattering at all, and it's completely see-through. completely. the material is so thin that i can't imagine it would hold up very well over time. this one is definitely going back.",0
"As another reviewer noted, the upper portion (back, chest, shoulders, etc.) fit nicely. however, the body of the dress was enormous and did, indeed, make me look much heavier throughout the middle. back to the store it goes.",0
I ordered this in size xl in the multi combo. the fit matches the photos. it's a strange sweater but i like it. i'm glad i got in on sale though. i'm pear-shaped and the curved hem fits me oddly. i like the longer length and the mix of blues/whites/peaches so i'm keeping it. it's not scratchy but also not soft. this is one of those purchases that i probably should return because i don't love it but i know i'll get enough use out of it to justify the sale price.,1
"Sometimes you have those days where you feel overweight and unattractive. this shirt is perfect for that. it has a chic cut, and it doesn't look like you are having an off day at all. so cute. and i really like the length as well. i usually wait until items go on sale, but this i had to buy right away.",1
I saw this dress in the window in the santa barbara store and fell in love with it! it is described as a robe in one post i saw but i think it looks so much more like a great fall/winter maxi. in the window display it was paired with a cognac leather belt which made it look even better.,1
"I'm a rather small person--5'2"", about 100 lbs, 32a bust. i typically take a 24p/00p/xxs. knowing how retailer's sizing is a bit all over the place, i ordered this tee in both xxs and xs, planning to return the size that was less preferred. imagine my surprise when i try on one of the tees and i barely can get it on; imagine my further surprise when i realize that the xs is the tee that was so clingy. now i realize that this is supposed to be a body-skimming tee, but even as petite as i am, i coul",0
"This unit is gorgeous as a dress or as a top with a cami, skinny jeans and boots. i'm wearing it to my cousins wedding and obsessed. i bought a long delicate necklace at retailer with a gold pendant and it falls perfectly with the neckline. my only slightly negative comment is about the quality. the material is beautiful but i noticed the elastic coming through the ends of the waistband where it snaps shut. still keeping it though!",1
"I purchased this shirt in blue hoping it would be a basic add-on to my wardrobe. it's been about a month and i have since washed and worn it twice. the color is now fading and i found a hole in the front of the shirt! i'm not sure if its the fine fabric that caused it to tear, but i washed it on gentle cycle and didn't do anything that would have warranted a tear. sadly this did not serve up to its purpose. i wouldn't suggest paying the price tag or even sale price for an item that i don't expec",0
I was so excited to get this dress since it look so pretty on line but unfortunately the it was horrendous on. the model must have the dress tailored because it looks like a huge tent on me. it was very wide bust down and made me look 30 lbs heavier. i'm 5'4 and 125 lbs- ordered extra small and it fits bust up and arms so i say it's tts up top.,0
"The pictures online do not do this justice. i did not even recognize it as the same dress at first. i went a size down and that way it flatters my curves beautifully instead of looking like a robe. it can actually be worn 3 ways- i like closing the closest snap(there's two) in the middle with a skinny belt over it, and a slip dress underneath. this way, the dress has a deep v neck and opens out in front when walking. think 1940's glam. it can also be fully closed like in the picture, or left ope",1
"This dress looked great on the hanger, but once on, it did absolutely nothing for me.

navy is one of my most flattering colors, but the navy in the dress did not make up for the yucky second color that was so blah it just reminded me of dirt. that second color made me look drab.

i am 5'8"" with a long torso and wear a size 12 in tts tops and dresses, but the waist on this dress hit at an uncomfortable spot between by waist and ribs. i really needed the waist to be dropped further. or higher",0
"I bought this blouse at the store today and i love it! they stylist brought it for me to try on with the green chinos and it was perfect. it will go with jeans or dark pants as well. very unique and flattering! i got a size 2. i'm 5'7'"" and 130 pounds.",1
"Dress is very flattering on, not tent-like at all!",1
This is my new favorite shirt. i'm actually wearing it today! i had to order another in white too. grab it while you can!,1
"I loved the cut and style of this shirt, so was very disappointed when i put it on and it was very tight and slightly see-through. if you do order it, get it in a size larger.",0
"This white shirt is a perfect canvas. i can dress it up with a scarf for work or wear it with my favorite jeans. it's perfect for all body shapes with the a-line. i love how comfortable this shirt feels. i like wearing this shirt with my black knit pants, and my retailers braided collar vest.",1
"I ordered this dress in a xs petite. i am 5'0"" 105 lbs. the plaid looks more drab in person and the fit was very frumpy. the wrap style is typically flattering but on this dress, the dress tied above my natural waist and the fit made my hips appear larger. i was pretty disappointed in this little number and will be sending it back. it might work on taller people, like the model, but i would steer clear if you are a petite.",0
The shirt is very big. it would be cute as a maternity shirt.,0
"This lounge robe is the most fantastic, dramatic and comfortable wrap dress!  to the reviewers who posted pictures--you styled this to perfection.   a slip dress underneath is a must have since the opening basically unsecured.  i purchased the medium petite and i am 5'3"" 36dd and 140#.",1
"Appears much more sleek in the photograph. in real life, this shirt looks more like a pajama top. thin, extremely casual, not worth the price i paid- even in black. will be exchanging it tomorrow.",0
"I could live in this top: it's versatile enough to be dressed up or down or worn as a bottom layer; the color offerings are basic enough to match anything; and it's comfortable enough to wear around the clock. note that it runs small. i had to size up to a medium, even though 80% of everything else i wear is size small.",1
I wish this fit me better. i love the inside fur. it is extremely soft but it doesn't look flattering at all. it makes my shoulders look really broad and it was shorter in the length than i wanted. it wanted it fit over my butt (or cover half) and it sits a little below my waist. unfortunately i am taking it back. great idea though.,0
"I wanted to like this and even considered getting it altered, but just decided to return. it runs big and from the front it looks good, but the back just looked like a big oversized, stretched out tank. it was so comfy on though and not sheer or revealing. so if you're tall, go for it!!",0
"Good quality; casual feel good dress. it can be worn as dress, or as tunic over the pants.",1
"Unfortunately, the other reviews were accurate. i thought i could still make it work because i loved the design. but alas the dress is incredibly see-through. i tried using it like a bathing suit cover up, unbuttoned, like one of the models shows - but it looked very strange. would have definitely kept this dress for the beach if it weren't completely see-through.",0
"I saw this jacket and loved the plaid and the idea of a soft sherpa material as a lining was hard to pass up1it was true to size and the material was very nice. however, the button closure was difficult as the buttonholes seemed a bit too small. also, the back of the jacket did not lay flat and it kept rolling.... i had to return this jacket.",0
"This was long on me (i'm 5'1"") but it could easily be cinched up using the drawstring waist. very soft material, this will be a super comfy dress in hot weather. didn't seem too see-through.",1
"Really pretty for summer, especially beach and pool wear. but i'm only 5'1 and even the petite is i think a tad long for flats (which is my preferred shoe for this dress). i'm also ""curvy and busty on top, so unless you are blessed with a nice thin waist it's not as flattering as the tall thin model shows. but still it looks nice on, and i though it might look good also with white footless tights i have too. so i'm on the fence about keeping it, since it's really pretty for a summer party.",1
"The material and design of this beach dress is so pretty. i was hoping that this could be worn as both a dress and a swim suit cover-up, but it is only the latter. you can't see it from the photos (the model or mine), but it is very sheer.... it can really only be worn over a swimsuit. whatever you wear (or don't) will be completely visible. so if you are looking for just a lovely, unique beach dress, this is it! unfortunately for the price i need more versatility! i will consider it on sale!",1
"I love the color, the fabric and the style (especially in the model shots) but in reality, the cut is disproportionate. the hips and hip pockets flare out creating a saddlebag look. it is not smooth and fitted as shown on the model. overall you need to size down since i could pullover the dress without unzipping. i think the felted boiled wool is great quality but a tiny bit itchy. i still recommend the dress because i will be wearing it with a long sweater coat which will hide the weird hip act",1
"I'm 5'3 and ordered the small. as soon as i saw it in person, i knew it was an item to return. the material is too transparent, and designed to wear with undergarments or swim gear that you want people to see. it was way too long for me. i think it would work for a taller person. i just didn't feel it was worth the money for the quality and transparency.",0
"This is the most comfortable beautiful dress/cover up. i can't believe the sale price. when i ordered, my reg m was not available so i ordered a small. it fits except the top button (36c). i just called and got a m since there was one available today online. hoping it ships! so impressed with this! i'll wear in summer and spring with a white slip underneath.",1
"This is a beautiful dress. it's a great weight, unique pattern, and has gorgeous colors. it's fairly forgiving because of the heavy fabric but may run small on bottom. i am a 10 or 12 in pants, 10 dress right now and i bought the 12. i am 5'8"" and 175 lbs, and 36c - also in the last stretch of a weight loss journey so if that helps anyone choose sizing... also i have to buy long or tall pants and this dress was not too short and did not show my smooth wear underneath. i love it and bought it at",1
"I was disappointed in this shirt. the color was not the pretty blue pictured, but rather a grayish blue which may look good on a brunette, but not on a blonde. the fabric felt like linen and wrinkled easily. normally, the quality of the fabric is one of my main reasons to buy holding horses, but this one felt cheap. the detail and craftsmanship was beautiful, and i wish this shirt would have worked for me. i waited for it to go on sale and was very excited to receive it. holding horses is one of",0
"This top looked so cute on! i loved the color and the way it looked on my body. as cute as this looked tied, it could also be worn open as well with a tank top. loved it!",1
"This does run a little large, but it's light and flattering for me. the material is a very light/thin chambray, but it's also lined.",1
White and silver threads made fabric look grey. almost dirty. fit was nice and price is great. villa to pool to restaurant would be great. colored fabric would be better.,0
"I think this fits to true to size. i am 5""2 and 107 lbs. i always wear a xs. it was a tiny bit tight in the bust if i wore a big padded bra (34b). if i wore a normal very little padding bra, it did not pull much across the bust.",1
Dress is actually very cute - i like it better in person than online. the color is a very pretty deep denim blue color. it is cut very roomy/swingy. length is a bit too long in the back for my taste but still like the way it flows. i am very slight of frame and on me there is a lot of extra material but nothing a good tailor can't fix in a jiffy. perfect for a summer day/bbq or casual party.,1
"The softest cotton gauze but, not see through. relaxed but, the sleeves & neckline make it flattering. a gorgeous blue in person. so in love with this dress, going back for it in white!",1
Unique jacket..... but when i put it on i felt and looked like charlie brown. this will be going back.,0
"I thought this dress would be a cute beach cover up so i was excited to order it but i was very disappointed. i am 5'7 and i usually wear a size small top and 4 dress so i ordered a small in this dress but it was huge!! i understand that it is not meant to be form fitting and i wasn't expecting it to be but when i tried this on i felt like i was wearing a potato sack. i feel like an extra small would have been just as bad. i was so upset. it also has thin silver lines through it which, for me, m",0
I'm too tall for this. back goes halfway up my back. cannot do much with it other than front tie. fabric is not soft at all. not impressed. returned it.,0
"This is truly a lovely dress. the colors are beautiful and i love the contrasting but complimentary fabrics which add interest to an already elegant dress. the material is substantial without being stiff so that it flows gracefully and it flatters the figure.
in my opinion if fits true to size, i'm 32b, 5' and 103lbs and i got it in a 2p which is the size i normally get in dresses. it is slightly more loose than other retailer dresses in the same size but it still follows your curves without being",1
Easy to take this dress from casual to dressy! super comfortable and cute!,1
I love this dress but when i put it on i was aghast! the chest was tight and the body was voluminous!! added the pounds which no wants! best left to the waify girls.,0
"I don't like how short it is in the back.
i also prefer a solid vs. slubby material, 
back it goes.",1
"These pants were wonderful...for 2 seasons. yes, for almost $200 a pop they don't even last a full year! loved them so much, i bit the bullet & bought 4 pair. all 4 started to rip in the same spot! i tried to contact ag directly & they do not back up their products after 30 days. fortunately, retailer was wonderful (as always!) i will buy pilcro from now on - much better product for the money.",0
"I&#39;m 5&#39;3&quot; 118 lbs and the 26 navy fit great.  the gray i can hardly button and are less flattering.  i will order another size 26 in gray to see if it will fit better, but also try a 27.",1
"The materical is wonderful and light and the color is gorgeous, but the large was absolute gigantic. i'm returning it and sizing down possible to a small, which is unreal, since i wear a size ten normally! i am petite, height-wise, but more than length, there was just so much room width-wise. it swallowed me! the dress itself is lovely, though, so i'm definitely exchanging for a more reasonable size. but definitely size down!",1
"I typically wear xs or s, or zeros but i got this in a m.  it doesn't look big, it looks like a regular fit to me i think a small or xs would have looked and felt small.  it's soft beautiful and warm.  the hood is so cute.  the detail is just so good.  i love it over top of 2 long sleeve blouses i got there and one of the cloth and stone button downs.",1
"Very cute, and well made. fits true to size.",1
"Following another reviewer's advice, i ordered up to an xl. it's huge. stick with your normal size or go down one. it's a one of a kind piece. soft, lightweight, yet cozy and adorable. sadly have to return mine.",1
"This dress is fabulous with attention to most details. 5'4"" 103 lbs the 00 fits perfectly. overall fit is excellent, sleek, but not form fitting so very appropriate for work. length is also great, another plus.for work, many times the dresses are just a tad short, but this is great. arm holes are also great, not overly long as they often are. very nicely lined, substantial fabric. the only lack of attention to detail is they did not include the bra strap holders. why can't more dresses be made t",1
"I really loved the pattern and style of this dress! unfortunately, i had to return it because i have broad shoulders and it is a pretty stiff top that cut into the flabby area near my armpits. for most people it's probably perfect! but if you have wide shoulders or any concerns about the armpit flab, this might not be a great choice for you.",0
"These were great pants that fit well, had good rise, perfect stretch for my curves, and i was really happy to get them on sale. (i'm 5'10"", 165lbs, with a pear shape). 

after only three months of occasional wear (about once a week, at most), and following wash instructions perfectly, they started deteriorating. the pockets are becoming unsewn, the fabric has over-stretched in little sections that bunch, and the bottom hem is coming unraveled. these are the most low-quality horrible pants i've",0
I bought these cords in another color last year and they are my favorite pants. they are so comfy and keep their shape very well. when i saw they were back i had to buy another pair. i purchased navy and the color is beautiful.,1

"This dress is everything everyone said it was in the reviews. so cute and beautifully made. fully lined.
i felt it ran a bit small as i had to return it for the next size up, more so in the bust area. but the fit and length was perfect in the size 6. 5""10, 125lbs. i will say that all the raving reviews made me purchase
the dress without hesitation and i'm sure glad i did!",1
"How could this not be flattering to every figure? bunching of fabric is awesome at hiding imperfections (i know, i have become a master at hiding some of my residual baby weight for years now). this, paired with a darker color (and not black, yay!) makes for a perfect combination in a dress. i love that this is a deep purple, it is a dark color which is slimming, but in addition it has more appeal being colored. and it is so versatile! wear it along or with a cardigan/jacket on top. heels or boo",1
"I tried this jacket on in store, both m & l. both seemed to pull a little at waist/pocket (notice the raised pleat on the closeup. i ordered xl on line. it fits better but still seems to fit like the other two when fastened. snaps seem to be misplaced. on the plus side, the style is cute and there is brown (taupe) mixed in with the grey which is more flattering to brownettes. there isn't much difference in sizing of all three. i am not sure whether this is a keeper. open, it is fine and casual;",0
This is a tts cami that should be a staple in everyone's closet. great for layering.,1
Searching for blazers that don't look stuffy? this one fits the bill! mine is at alterations right now getting the sleeves shortened. other than the long sleeves the fit is very nice. this will be a versatile addition to my wardrobe. can't wait to get it back from the seamstress so i can wear it!,1
"Pretty much awesome... i tried it on in regualr size jsut to see, and i could almost get away with it... too bad i dind't try it on before hte 25% of f dresses... (also, i don't have an occasion to wear this).

length is midi, but since it is gathered, i could pull it up a little so it falls in the right spot on me.

color is very nice, overall sexy dress.

material is soft and comfortable, nothing wrong except i missed out on the sale! :-)",1
This blouse has such a beautiful print but then it just goes down from there and can't be saved. the fabric is a sheer silk so it comes with an attached camisole that just doesn't lay right underneath. the sleeves are all gathered up and they have a puffy gather at the top that just ruins the whole blouse. i wish it was just a simple popover type blouse because it really is a lovely print. definitely not worth the money even at 1/2 off plus 25-%.,0

"I can always count on retailer to sell unique pieces, so when i saw this sweatshirt online, i ordered it right away.  it&#39;s adorable and quirky, however, when i received it in the mail, it reminded me of something my grandma would wear.  the sleeves are puff sleeves and are really long, while the bottom of the sweatshirt hit pretty high on my waist that when i raised my arms my stomach was showing.  if this was a more tailored sweatshirt, i would be keeping it, but sadly it&#39;s going back.",0

"This is a very awkward and unflattering shirt. i am very petite--90 pounds and 5'2"". the arms fit--length and width, but nothing else about this fit. the scoop was so low and wide that i would require a shirt underneath. it fell exactly like a tent and made a bell shape around my thighs. yikes! it looks cute on the model, but not on me. the material is also very thin and felt sort of like it should be a pajama top.",0
"I wasn't planning on loving this dress when i tried it on. i loved the the color which is what prompted me to buy it. this dress fit perfectly. it hugs my body without feeling tight. the ruching is perfect. i didn't want to take it off! it's also very comfortable.
i'm 5'1"" , 107lbs and the xs petite fit perfectly. the dress hits me at the same length that is pictured. i think it would be easy to hem if you wanted it to be shorter. i have a short torso and saw no issues with that as some reviewer",1
"The material is super soft and i could see how this could be a great fall sweater, but the furry portion made the top too bulky. i should've sized down, but even then i think it still would've been a touch boxy. if it was boxy all the way through it'd be fine, but it feels like just the top was bulky while the bottom half was fine. perhaps good for more broad shouldered people. i have very small shoulders. also reminded me too much of a sheepskin rug.",0
"True to size and lovely dress, except the arm pit area is tight and pinches. had to return.",0

"This blazer is really well made, it has a nice weight and stretch to it. i think it might run a bit on the large size, i am sometimes a small and sometimes an xs and the xs is perfect. it's a great blazer to throw on to cinch together a casual yet put together look. i don't think the picture here does it justice. it will be getting a ton of wear in my work wardrobe. i love it!",1
Love this skirt. it was on my wish list from the first time i saw it in the catalog. so glad i was able to get it when it hit sales. i love it. thr color is more subdued than pictured but very nice anyway. the cut is awesome and flatering pretty true to size for me (petite) winner,1
"I love this skirt, in theory. the style is fun and original and the quality was excellent. however, being suede, the skirt was very bulky. also, at 5'8"" and liking skirts to be long enough for work, i typically don't have problems with long length. however, i thought this skirt fit too long on me such that it distracted from the style. i really wanted to love this skirt - hopefully they'll make some updates in future styles.",0
"I was so glad to find such a beautiful item made in the usa. i knew the workmanship would be above average. the embroidery is gorgeous and makes these jeans so unique. i am usually a 24 in pilcro slouchy chinos, size 0 in most pants , 25 in jeans so i ordered these in xs. the waist was at least 7-8 inches too large. they were enormous in every aspect of fit. no belt could possibly make these stay up. very disappointed . i would recommend an xs if you are a size 6 to 8.",0
"I'd been eyeing this for a long time but couldn't afford the full price. when it came on sale, my size -- regular 8 -- was sold out. so i took a chance and went with the petite 8 (only difference is length). and am i glad i did!

it fits beautifully, even a little roomy. but the length is perfect. the longer pieces are at/barely below the knee, and the shorter flap is about two inches above. (for reference, i'm 5'7"", 135 pounds, measurements 38-30-38.)

the skirt is substantial, with high-qualit",1
"Like most people here, i wanted this beautiful dress to fit. so, i decided to see for myself if maybe, just maybe the negative reviews were wrong. they weren't. if you have any sort of breasts at all, the top probably won't fit properly. i imagine a narrow upper torso, like a 32 or 33, possibly a 34 might find the top part of the dress closes properly, but with a 36 c, i could not get a size 12 to button up. the waist hit at a strange spot, and despite the picture showing a narrow waist and grad",0

"I loved this top, and i normally order petites when i'm able to, but this wasn't offered in a petite size so i took a chance and ordered it in regular. just got it in the mail and when i pulled it out i thought wow, it is a petite! but its not, just runs small. i got the xs size and it was tight under the arms, and the peplum bottom came up a bit high and felt slightly maternity-ish the way the bottom part flared out. i actually thought it was a bit too short too, even on me (5'2"", about 118 lbs",1
"I loved this dress and was hoping to keep it. but, for an a-lign dress it was not roomy enough in the hips and the waist was baggy. i think this dress would look great on a very very slim build with straight hips.",0
"I ordered this in the pink color. the fit was fine, but i didn't care for how thin it was. there is lining, which i suppose is there to combat the thinness, but it's only in certain places. the lining should have been all over. maybe if i had gotten this in blue, it wouldn't have been so bad.",0
"I thought this top would be a nice addition to my fall wardrobe, and while the color didn't disappoint, everything else did. it's a very loose slub so it's very see through and thin, i'd have to wear a cami under it. also the tie front has a very high slit! like it went almost halfway up the shirt and definitely would have shown skin unless you layered the shirt. i do think this top would be a cute throw on top for yoga/ gym wear, but definitely not at this price. pass for me sadly...",0
This hoodie was too thin. you can see right through it. i returned it.,0
"This dress is beautiful in person, the details on it are amazing. the only problem i had was that it ran small. i am usually an 8 or 10 in retailer dresses, but had to size up to a 12 just to be able to breath. the top on the 10 was tight in the chest and arms. when i sized up to the 12 there was more room, but not by much. the embroidery detail on the dress is the best part, it is exactly as shown in the picture. plus it has pockets which is always a plus for me. lightweight and great for warm we",1
I ordered the peach version in size xl. it fit true to size--matched the photos online. i hand washed it and it did shrink a bit. the fabric & knit used are so soft. the color is so pretty too.,1
"I'm 5'-4"", 130lbs with a 32f chest. this dress looked like a cross between little house on the prairie and a mu mu. i can't imagine this looking good on anyone who isn't 7' tall. also, the straight across, rather high neck line wasn't flattering to a large chest and then the arm holes are huge. the fabric was a bit shiny and felt cheap. it wasn't see through but it had the feel of a nightgown, not a hundred dollar dress.",0
"I tried this sweater on in the store. i wanted to love it so badly as it is soft and feminine, and would be a great causal layering piece. however, there are pockets in the sweater that are right on seam, and they actually bubble out from the natural drape of the sweater. not to mention, unless you're built very narrow, the pockets will fall at, and accentuate hips, and not in a flattering way. the nice details are the feel of the knit, the layered style, with a cottony lined hood and ""faux"" lay",0
I love this dress. the design is gorgeous. however the bust is extremely small. only someone in the a or b range will fit into their appropriate size. i am disappointed.,0
"This dress fit so oddly. i tried on two different sizes and both did this super unflattering poochy thing at the belly. the dress wasn't tight at my hips in either size, it was just that there was weird extra fabri right around the midsection that stuck out. maybe i was too short? couldn't figure it out. 

the color and detailing are beautiful though! a little tight in the bust.",0
"I would have kept this dress if it weren't for the giant arm holes and reveal my entire bra on both sides. other than that, it looks just like it does on the model and is a nice, substantial material.",0
"I have been eyeing this top for a couple weeks and finally found it in my store. it was a good sign when i saw our stores in-house stylist wearing it! i absolutely love the fit--it's soft and stretchy and fabric is nice quality. i'm typically a medium, sometimes large--i bought the medium and it's perfect. i could have gone down to a small as well. the large was way too big (for reference i'm 5'8"", athletic, 150lbs). this top is going to take me everywhere this summer! worth a try!",1
"I really was surprised at how much i liked this top. it is, as others pointed out, a poncho type overlay with a tank connected underneath. it is very comfortable and forgiving of any body boo boos. looks great with skinny white pants.",1
I wasn't sure how this top would look on me but i tried it on and i love it. plus it is very comfortable. i would highly recommend it!,1
"Perfect cozy sweater, nice details. exactly what i wanted to upgrade from sweatshirts.",1
"I am very disappointed with this order. the shirt looks and feels cheap, is not flattering in any way. i am sending it back right away.",0
Loved this jacket so much i bought both colors! this jacket is simple yet adds so much to an outfit. the lightweight material makes it perfect for the florida seasons. as for the snaps mine work perfectly i usually just keep them undone for my hands. the sizing i think runs a bit large. i usually am a medium but ordered smalls and they fit perfectly even with the perfect amount of breathing room. highly recommend,1
"I typically wear a size xl in retailer clothes. i'm a size 16 in tops and this sweater in xl fit really baggy with no form fitting. it's super soft and i love the color, but it was just unflattering on me.",1
Loved this so much i bought it in black and in grey. it fits perfectly and it lays awesomely!! i ended up buying the black in medium and the grey in large for a bit of a different look for each. i usually wear a medium or large so i'd say it fits super true to size - just depends on how you want it to fit!,1
Thought i would try this as other reviewers loved it and it's out of my comfort zone. it looked like a poncho with a baggy tank underneath. not worth the price. the tassels looked a bit worn as well.,0
"Very soft, clean feel. i got this in pink and received so many compliments. perfect to layer on top of your favorite tee or tank. i wish they had it in navy as well.",1
"I tried this dress on in the store, and nearly bought it. other reviewers commented on the tight chest, but i must admit, this was the one part of the dress that fit like a dream on me. however, i am very small busted (34a). the waist is very flattering, as well. but, the skirt seemed to poof out at the wrong spots (namely, where the pockets are- i love pockets, but not when they create extra bulk at my widest points) and the skirt was about two or three inches longer than i would've liked. anyt",1
"This is a very lightweight, comfy sweater jacket. i wanted to love but didn't find it ""special"" enough for the price. i am usually between a small and medium and tried on both sizes in the gray and the navy. the small fit snug in the shoulder but i liked how the layering showed at the bottom of the front. that look was lost on the medium, though the general fit was better. in the end, the looked medium too sloppy for my taste, and the small felt too small.",1
"I originally bought this dress in the store. however, it ended being a size too big. so, i reordered the smaller size online (although it was backordered for a month). when it arrived, i noticed the sleeves were not cinched (like they are in the picture as well as the original dress i had purchased in-store). i thought maybe it had been a fluke so i returned the dress and reordered it again because it is a great dress. the second one just arrived and the sleeves are not cinched as well. this may",0
"I ordered the pink, and it was gorgeous. the color and feel were so soft, i would have kept it if it were a blanket. but i did send it back because as a sweater, it just didn't lay right. it has a sort of inside layer that just didn't fit right with the outside sweater layer, so it ended up puffing up on the sides at the waist. that was not flattering. and the hood was too large and floppy looking. too bad.",0
"This was was a great buy! i got in on sale and the quality is really excellent. the material is thick and stretchy. there is a spanx like liner which is really nice as well for smoothing out the bumps. the dress style and cut is very slimming. i am more a size 14 (at 5'10"") and the 12 fit well. i agree with the other reviewer regarding the twisted shoulder. it doesn't lay on me either like it does on the model, but it doesn't detract from the dress so its a keeper given the other positives.",1
Cute top but does stretch out a bit throughout the day.,1
"This just did not sit well on me. while the length was fine and the fabric was a nice thick weave with a flattering amount of stretch, the twist at the shoulder just looked odd. it did not sit flat at all, so it just looked like i had gotten dressed in the dark and had not managed to sort out my sleeves. given the spot-on quality, i would definitely look into other items from this brand, but back this dress went.",0
"This hoodie has a lovely, flattering drape and fits true-to-size (m for me), and is light but quite warm. the cottony nylon layers along the front panels and hood add style. it will be warm enough as an outer layer on a slightly brisk day or indoors in cooler weather. i was going to opt for the blue, but in the store, the light gray ~ which is a bit darker and more marled than online (at least on my monitor) ~ looked really lovely and seemed more versatile.",1
"I love the dress, fits as pictured , i'm a size 4 and fits just right. it is a keeper, well made.",1
Very comfortable and looks really good on me. that's very important!,1
I have many sweaters but i bought this during the sale and it is very soft and comfortable.,1
I'm normally between a 4-6 in retailer dresses. i had to go up to a size 10 just to get the buttons across the chest to close and lay properly without feeling like i would bust out. definitely not for those with any kind of chest.,0
"I really like the look of these socks, and have become obsessed we over-the-knee socks for winter this year. they are very tick which is nice for keeping warm and for durability for a long lasting product. my only complaint is that they are very difficult to get over the knee. this can be a great thing, because they certainly do stay put-which is a huge problem with over-the-knee socks. however, by the end of the day i was pretty sure i was going to lose a leg from poor circulation.

i am still",0
I'll start this by saying i usually wear a m or l depending on the shirt. i'm 20 weeks pregnant and ordered a medium. it's huge! i was thinking i would be able to wear this for a bit while preggo and then would be able to wear it after baby with no problem. i'm going to order a small because the fabric is so soft and i love the design and color.,1
"I ordered the navy/gray version in size xl. it fits me true to size, matching the online photos. the colors matched too. the fabric is so soft. it's warm while being lighter in weight. very comfortable. the collar wasn't bulky either. it's made to last. one of my retailer favorites.",1
"The embroidery on the side is cute, and they're nice and airy for hot days. however, the stitching on the legs unraveled after only two washes. also, they're extremely long; i'm 5'7 and had to take them up around 3 inches.",0
Just not as long as in the picture. it hit me at my hips not good!,0
"As soon as i saw this dress online i loved it and ordered it! unfortunately it just didn't work for me, i tried it in a small, medium and large. for reference i'm 5'2"", 145lbs, 36d. the dress is really pretty in person, but i looked like a little girl in it. my daughter who is 4'9"", 100lbs, 34a, also tried it on and she too looked like a little girl in it. the material is beautiful along with the detail at the neckline, however the neckline is not open like in the picture, it's more pushed toget",0
These socks were very thin and the elastic at the top was very rigid. i could not get these socks to go any higher than half-way up my calf. i would not recommend this product. it felt very cheap and not of good quality.,0
"Beautiful and soft and so well made cropped cardigan by the in house retailer branding. the color is more muted in person but will work with many different skirts and pants including jeans. i have many ideas for this lovely cardigan ! the size medium for my 34 dd chest, 145 lbs and 5 '4 inches is perfect and the sleeves bellow out a bit which gives this cardigan a nice sharp look. i agree with the other reviewer--- more colors and more of type of quality  and character please for seasons ahead! lo",1
"These socks were so narrow, especially on top, that they pinched my thighs and we're almost painful to wear all day. my thighs are pretty narrow, i'm only five feet tall and my legs and hips are the thinnest part of my body. i understand that they need to be reinforced on top so that they don't slip down but these are definitely made for a person who is unhealthily skinny. ""one size"" is definitely not true. they also snag easily.",0
"This is such a great top! it runs huge though. i normally wear a small but bought the xs. it fits ok. i would prefer the xxs, but i bought it on sale and retailer is sold out. for reference, i am 5`6 and about 138 lbs. very flowy soft fabric, great purchase.",1
"This dress is stunning in person, though the pictures do it no justice. it was overall a very clingy fit. i'm 5'3 with long legs and it was too short for me so i did not purchase, but would recommend it for those with short legs.",1
"I was afraid the twist at the front would be too bulky, but it adds a nice extra touch to an otherwise simple shirt. i got it in the blue and the color is beautiful. a basic piece with a little bit more; very happy",1
"Although i bought 2 sizes down from my regular size, they were still big and, made my derriere look flat. i would have kept them as weekend kick-around jeans, but the flat behind just made them a must return.",0
"I finally tried this on now that it went on sale, and it was surprisingly flattereing. love the blue color, and i assume the purple was equally nice. fit is true to size as in i tried on the regular xs and it was great, long but ok for me,",1
"Great shirt that runs true to size. i got the turqouise color which is very pretty. it cuts lower, but doesn't show much cleavage.",1
"This is such a fun dress. the linen and cotton mixture is very unique and comfortable. for reference, i am 5'3"" and about 110 pounds. the regular xs hits me exactly the way it is shown in the photo. the color is a true oatmeal which is so nice for fall and even though i am fair with strawberry blonde hair, it doesn't wash me out. the sleeves are a little long but i rolled them once and it is perfect. i love this dress and it will look great with booties or boots for the fall.",1
Beautiful top. works wonderful on hourglass figures.,1
"I was so excited to find this dress in the store! i immediately headed for the dressing room to try this beauty on....what a disappointment. the fabric is stunning, but the fit is extremely voluminous . i am normally a small to medium, so i grabbed a small......the only way to describe this dress is tentlike!  it was huge from the waist down. i don't think i could size to an xs because i am a 34d and the top half of the dress fit perfect!  i was sad to leave the store without this dress.",0
"I'm always weary of v necks but this shirt is great. the fit is true to size and while it is a v neck, it's not such a deep plunge that you need a cami underneath. great material too and perfect for dressing up a bit. i bought the blue color and love it!",1
"Overall: soft material, cute pattern - but definitely a return as just didn't fit right. 

fit: i am a six in most tops and based on the size chart - i ordered the size small. it fit comfortably around my bust - but the cup placement was basically at the center of my chest - so that my breasts were squished uncomfortably and unflattering in the middle. i've lost a bit of weight recently - so i'm more of a 36a, than 36b these days - but this wouldn't work for me or i imagine anyone with a broad",1
"The color and embellishment of this top are beautiful. this would look great on anyone super lean, otherwise you just look really wide as there is no frame in the torso of this top at all. the back picture shows it well. i am 5'9, 142 lbs and i ordered the small and medium and both were huge! with regrets going back.",0
"If you are thinking about purchasing this dress without trying on in person, i bet you aren't going to be happy with it. for a phisique that is 5' 3"" and 115lbs, this dress is not too short. however, the back key hole design is just not flattering. i felt like clothes in the back shoulder area is not fitted well and the zip up closure is not all the way zipped up even though it was so.",0
"I tried this on in a different retailer a couple of weeks ago... ....tried on a different one last night..same size and it looked baggy, sleeves way too long, etc.  let me add that i am usually a xs/s petite but some regular extra smalls will work also.  this was a xs reg.  even the sa could see that one looked like it fit smaller ( i showed her the photo in my phone) while this one swallowed me.  bottom line, you will need to try this one on as the sizes seem to vary.",1
Love the wash and fit of this jean. the perfect summer go to for me.,1
"This top is spectacular. intense and color soaked. i got bleu. super stretchy and comfy. the twisty part hugs and emphasizes your curves...even size 34a like me. the v neck is not too wide and low cut. it is narrower, close fitting and attractive. the seam in the middle thorax is a tad strange but it needs to exist due to the twist design. overall this top is cute, long and let's say men and women of all ages will enjoy it. it will make you beautiful on the outside and inside. it is not my usual",1
"I truly cannot understand the great reviews on this dress!  i purchased in both a sp and a mp.  i am 5'2"" 120#.  the mp fit perfectly.  i definitely wouldn't keep it though because it looks like someone sewed a bunch of old sweatshirts together.  it's not super soft, coarse on the inside, and feels old.  the back is longer than the front, it just looks like something my daughter would make in sewing class out of scraps.  even with leggings and great boots, it looks worn.",0
"Overall, it's a beautiful dress, and i really wanted it to work. but the material feels cheap (at least not what you'd expect for the price), and as other reviewers have mentioned, it's just a tad too short. for reference, i'm 5'5, 125 lbs and the 2 fit well, but hung well above my knees. there's no way i could wear this without unintentionally flashing a few people. sadly this dress will be returned.",0
"A little thin, but overall very cute. i like it with waist high skirts.",1
"This shirt appears nice in the pictures. it appears to have a bit of style. wrong. the shirt is one of the thinnest fabrics i've ever purchased. i live in warmer climate and its nice to have different cotton shirts with some style. this shirt has no style, and i thought it would. i have purchased this brand before, and thought this fabric would be similar. the other shirts were way nicer, softer, and had a different level of construction. i wanted to wear this shirt out and when i put it on it w",0
"I have a few pairs of the stevie ankle, so i thought i try these. they have very little stretch and feel tight in the waist. the distressing near the front pockets is really apparent...like white stripes. they make the jean look overall cheap. not worth $198, in my opinion.",0
"Love this top! i was worried it would plunge too deep, especially because i'm quite flat chested - but it is perfect. i think it would look gorgeous on a volumptuous woman too. that's the beauty of it. and the color is my absolute favorite right now ... :)",1
"I bought this impulsively to wear to a wedding, and i&#39;m so glad i did. it is so soft and comfy and gorgeous--and has pockets. it&#39;s loose but really really flattering somehow. i would typically get a size 12 in a fitted dress but the medium was perfect for me.",1
"A very pretty pair of over-the-knee socks. i purchased the dark grey color, which has a metallic silver thread running through it. a nice subtle but glitzy touch. the knitted pattern is intricate and nicely done. i'm 5' 4"" and they do come up well above the knee. if you are walking quite a bit, they don't stay above the knee, but they do seem to stay just below the knee. because the yarn is fairly thin they don't look bunchy even if they come down a bit. i have very sensitive skin, and metallics",1
I'd hoped these would be cozy and warm. the fabric is thin and slinky. it grabs and emphasizes every bump and roll. couldn't wait to get them off. just horrible. and that price is very steep. can't recommend.,0
"This sweater just arrived in my mailbox and it's already my favorite piece of clothing. it is the softest thing i own... and it feels so luxe. as the reviewer below noted: yes, it has pockets. they are slit-style pockets (probably why you can't see them in the photo) and the opening is trimmed with the same cable detail featured on the front of the sweater.

i'm also a professor... but i still get mistaken for a grad student so i don't mind appearing ""professorial.""
i'll probably wear this to th",1
"Tried this in store today and id say it is exactly as pictured (length is similar on me at 5'7"", colors as shown, cut is loose but not overly sacklike). my normal size s fit loosely, but not in an unflattering way. sizing down might have been too narrow in the shoulders. the embroidery seemed to be good quality, but the fabric itself was on the thinner side with no lining. i would have liked to see a liner at this price (and probably would have bought), but i think i'll wait for a promo or sale",1
"First of all i need to state that i am 5,1"". i usually get the petite size small but they were out so i took a risk and ordered the regular small which i can sometimes get away with. upon opening the parcel, it seemed bigger than i expected. the knit is very chunky (not a bad thing) but thicker than i expected. the fit was way too large for me. the shoulders were bulky and because it is a cocoon shaped cardigan, there was just too much excess fabric draping around my petite frame. i think if i c",0
"I love this dress. i think the cut, fabric and embroidery are all flattering. this dress is comfortable and can be dressed up or down. i am 5'1 and weigh anywhere from 108-113 lbs. i at first tried on the xxs petite and liked the look but found it to be tight in the arm area. they didn't have an xs petite so i tried on the s petite to see if there was any major difference. there totally was! so i ordered the xs petite online and can't wait to get it!!",1
"Oh wow no.
as the previous reviewer said, much lighter than the picture!
rise and inseam are as described but with the light denim they combined to make a bad look for this 40something. maybe for a younger audience who like the 90s retro vibe?
the fit is true to size, i tried the 27 and it was a nice snug fit around the bum (waist 28/29, hips 36, usually a 27 or 28 in jeans, sometimes even a 29 if they're super skinny).",0
I bought this dress on sale and it is perfect! i wish that i would've invested sooner and picked it up in a number of different colors. the cut is amazing and the cutout on the back is sexy without exposing too much skin.,1
"I ordered this on line first, but i really recommend getting to a store to look at them closely! due to the fact that the first dress, the embroidered lines were not sewn level on the bottom horizontal stripe areas, and the fact that they didn't meet made me feel it wasn't worth anywhere near the price! i feel you can sort of see this in the stock photo, although it may be just the way it's hanging. also, many of the center areas of the embroidered flowers and designs have a loose, unfinished th",1
Bought this based off the reviews here but this was a miss for me. the colors weren't as vibrant as pictured and the waist in this dress is huge. not flattering and it went back. i buy an retailer dress every week so i just exchanged this one for another one i loved. not hard to do at all,0
"This dress is gorgeous. it swings beautifully, it's soft, it's incredibly flattering! i would say it runs big. i ordered an xxs petite, normally i would wear xs petite, and it fits great. for reference, i'm 5'1"" and a 32dd. finally a loose fitting dress that doesn't make me look pregnant!",1
"Adore the bright embroidery against the black background!  mine was well done and no loose threads.  although this is all synthetic fabric (which i hate paying for!) but i couldn't help myself once i tried it on.  it's very roomy and if you're slender, size down unless you prefer the breezy swingy look like i do.  this is a three season dress that will do well with layers and without.  i picked regular hem instead of petite and it actually looks slimmer on me than the shorter version.",1
"I'm glad i saw this item in stores, otherwise i would have passed it right by online. the embroidery is intricately detailed and sharp, and the fabric quality is great. i had to size down for this dress. it's comfortable, and can be dressed up or down. its a great versatile piece!",1
"This sweater/jacket looks just like the photo in real life, but the inside is so scratchy. i physically recoiled when trying it on as the interior of the sleeves feels like sandpaper. unlined and uncomfortable. no thank you!

should you choose to proceed, i found the fit tts. i'm 5'8, wear an 8/10 and the medium worked for me.",0
"Maybe it's my curves or the way i'm only 5'4"" but this was a hot mess on me! it is soooo long and cut to low for my 36d chest. it is slim and the cut usually is flattering but somehow this dress was anything but! it is really shiny and the material is heavier than anticipated for warm weather. if you are super tall and skinny with no boobs, go for it! had to send back!",0
"Was excited about this sweater but it really didn't wow me when i put it on. the v-neck is quite low and the sweater is a bit short. loved the ideas of the fringe but in the end, it went back.",0
This dress is beautiful on so many levels. the colors and print are amazing and the maxi sweater dress idea is unique. it fits true to size and is very flattering. my only issue is the amount of shine that it has from the metallic threads running through it. i would have preferred less shine which would make the dress more versatile.,1
"I wanted to love this shirt so much! i got this as a gift for christmas in the black. the first time i wore the shirt 3 of the buttons on the back fell off. keep in mind that they are not decorative and they held the shirt together. needless to say i was not so pleased to have my shirt fly open from the back. retailer and their amazing customer service took this shirt back no problem, but i wanted to give the fair warning!",0
"I tried this on at the store, and though it was pretty, i was a little underwhelmed. it fit but had no give so it might not have been too comfortable for movement unless sized up. the embroidered polka dots were a lovely idea, but the quality was not great - they were already fraying and pretty irregular looking. the idea of the top was better than the execution.",1
"Love the design and style of this dress when i saw it online, however, it falls a little short once in person. it was a bit boxier than i wanted and the lines didn't make it appear as a swing dress, highlighting your figure.

i wish this could have worked, however, it felt a little too unshapely.",0
"I was looking for a dress for playing cello at my friend's wedding. the colors looked perfect, the cut was great, etc. very disappointed to find out how sparkly and scratchy the dress was in person, and sad that the slit came right to my knee, which is a really weird height. sadly returning - might purchase again if it goes on sale and i can't find anything better before the wedding :(",0
"This top is true to size for me, i'm 5'8'' 128lbs, and i ordered both a size 4 and 6. the six was too big, i could tell because the shoulder seem was in the wrong spot and i couldn't lift my arms, the shoulder seem hung too low. the 4 was perfect, i had full range of motion for my arms and was easily able to bend down and touch my toes without any pulling on the buttons of the shirt. i always order a small or size 4 in tops. the bigger size didn't add any length in front just added a boxier feel",1
"This is a great casual top for spring! i loved the covered buttons in the back, and the longer back peplum too. the peplum in the front covers the top of pants. i am 5'9"" tall and often times have difficulty finding sleeves that are long enough, so the 3/4 length sleeves are perfect. the fabric is light weight but not sheer, and the embroidered dots are well done.",1

"Fit is perfect! very flattering. they are very long, so i will need to shorten.",1
"I am in love with this dress. not too dressy, not too casual and hugs the body in all the right spots. i am 5'7 with curves and this flatters well. i also bought (and adore) the velvet taupe ankle strap shoes they show with them, super in-love with the whole look. dress will look great with booties too. just hope i don't snag the sweater dress, which looks easy to do, because i want to wear this all fall and winter long.",1
"This is a beautiful shirt. the back is a few inches longer than the front which makes for a cool effect.
the only thing that i didn't like about this shirt was how fragile the buttons on the back are. i was taking this shirt off and one popped off. when i went to hang it, another one popped off! so i had to return it. such a shame.",0

"I love rifle paper, and when i saw this dress online, i knew that i had to have it. this dress is even prettier in person than it is in the picture. it's pretty and delicate, and can easily be dressed up or down. i found this dress to fit true to size. it definitely has that ""baby doll dress"" fit to it, but i love it! this is a dress that i'll feel beautiful in and pull out of my closet over and over again.",1
"This romper is sooo comfortable and cute! it is definitely pretty casual, and probably best used as a beach cover up, as it exposes a lot of skin. that being said, i have worn it out and about on very hot days and felt totally fine. as far as sizing, i usually order a small, and got this in a small and it fit perfectly.",1
"This is the most unflattering peplum top i have ever tried on. fit perfectly as a size 6 should in the arms, shoulder, chest... then the waist was huge! just hung off of me like a flour sack. it was wider than the chest measurements, which made me appear frumpy instead of tailored and classic. combine that with the high-low hemline and it looked like a project runway reject. sent back immediately, do not buy this if you have (or want to appear to have) an hourglass figure, it will do nothing for",0
"This top is extremely well done. it looks classy and timeless. i tried on the white version in store, but chose to order the black as the white was too sheer.",1
"Stylist in store warned be about issues with buttons falling of easily. loved the look, so bought it anyway. lost 2 buttons on the first wear. it did not feel snug on me, but i guess i could try a size up and see if the buttons hold a bit better. either way i will return or exchange.",0
"I love love love this swimsuit! yes it's a bit pricey for a bathing suit, but i love the design and colors and the back detailing is sexy yet not all that revealing. i can't wait to wear it in hawaii next month! the only part to be careful about is not to stretch it too much when putting it on and taking it off, i can see the diamond cutouts stretching or even ripping if pulled too hard by accident. overall a great swimsuit for the summer!",1
A very versatile and cozy top. would look great dressed up or down for a casual comfy fall day. what a fun piece for my wardrobe!,1
"Sctrachy, short, boxy, stiff.
loved the idea of this sweater, but this was not what i was hoping for",0
"I love everything about this except the length. i am short and usually order a petite and even this is really cropped on me. the quality is good, thick and substantial, color is great but very cropped and sleeves are long on me as well. just weird proportions so sadly, going back.",0
"Material is heavier so maybe not for summer months, but fit & feel great. love that they fall beyond the knee where other leggings can fall just below the knees and be uncomfortable and restricting which makes no sense for ""active"" wear.",1
"I was pleasantly surprised by how well this dress skims over the body. definitely needs the belt that comes with the dress to add some shape. the color is gorgeous, great print and very light fabric - perfect for summer.",1
"The minute i put this sweater on, i couldn't wait to take it off. it was way too scratchy for me. so, for those with any type of sensitivity to wool, this is not the sweater for you. otherwise, i thought the design was quite cute.",0
"I love this dress, but have found that this brand runs large. i'd order a size down.",1
Beautiful maxi fits tts. i normally wear a 10/12 and took a 12. it is flattering to the waist and makes me feel girly. the colors are so beautiful and the length is good for my 5'9 frame.,1
"I ordered my usual sz s during the promo. arrived yesterday & the fit is perfect w/ a little room to spare for layering. it's a snap front closure, front patch pockets, & attached hood that is small to med size-not huge or overwhelming. it's 100% acrylic which isn't my 1st choice, but soft, comfy & seems good quality. length falls abt 3"" below my knees. arm length is fine. pretty much looks as in the pic including the marled color. if you are in need of a great functional long swtr w/ good looks",0
"This vest doesn't have a button, so i thought i could put my own. but when it arrived, it just didn't fit that well. the opening in the front is too big, the vest itself while nice and warm is not functional at all due to openings everywhere. i don't know, why even make a vest like this with no front button and such a wide opening, how is one supposed to keep warm at all?",0
"Note the sleeves on the model. that is how your regular size will fit your arms. however, even if you have skinny arms like i do, the sleeves will be tight. i bought my regular size xs and it was clingy with an odd flair and the length seems as though i ordered a petite and i am only 5 ft 2 in.
i advise to try a few sizes on if you really are interested. the red is truly a red which is a good thing because so often it is hard to find a red that is not neon.",0
I have been living in mine since i bought it! so comfy and dressier than a plain sweatshirt!,1
"Nice lines and texture but fit is very tight and i experienced the sizing to run small. i am 5'6"" and 115# with small frame. i usually wear xs or s from retailer, so ordered the turtleneck in small. the size small was super tight. i love the design so exchanging my order for a medium.",1
Wore my new red cardigan for the first time today to work. fit is tts. this is a true red and not neon or orange tinted. it wraps nicely in front and has a nice flair at the hips.. i also like the detail in the knit. i like to push my sleeves up and love the fact that they don't slide down my arms all day. i'll wear this cardigan a lot.,1
This top is really cute. my daughter tried it on and tried to take it.,1
"I like it a lot - very soft, just enough detail to keep it interesting, but still a classic look. i got this in a small and it's a little short on me compared to the model. i'm 5'6"", long-waisted, 34b (small side), 145lbs (carry bulk of my weight in legs.so trim on top). i will keep the small but also get a medium; the small ties a little high and i also want a sweater that can cover my shirt tails when i don't tuck them in.. i got it in black, so can't comment on the orange or red.",1
"I bought the red cardigan because i didn't have anything similar and was so pleasantly surprised by the fit and design that i'm going have to buy it in whatever other colors are available. it's very versatile - looks great tied in front, in back, at the side - and has a tiny bit of flare at the bottom so it's more feminine and flirty than your average cardigan. i have a few tops by this brand and have been really happy with the quality and design.",1
"This is a very nice turtleneck. the variations in the ribbing are a modern (and flattering) touch. in some of the photos online it almost looked to me like there are color variations - fyi there are not. all the ribbing areas are the same shade of black.

unless you are very small framed, i would recommend sizing up; or, if you typically wear a m or a l, go with the l. as reference i have wide shoulders (wider than my hips), large biceps, and a 34b chest, and i went with the l because",1
"I never would have thought to choose this, but an retailer associate suggested the black sweater as a topper while i was trying on the camellia dropwaist dress, and it made a sale, i bought them both! the sweater, while not decked with beads or embroidery, adds an incredible definition to any outfit that is overly flowy. i would say the photo above showing the grey sweater says it all. usually a size 6 in retailer dresses, the small fit well. i appreciate the cotton fiber content, as well as the ver",1
This top is exactly what i was expecting. super comfortable while still looking stylish. just covers your bum so you can wear it with leggings or jeans!,1
"Quite cute, it feels good on. the fit is tts and the colors are bright and just as depicted. i am a medium in most of retailer clothes and this fit nicely.",1
"This is a beautiful sweater that i wanted to love but i couldn't for a few reasons i thought i'd share: the color is bright orange. it is not softer like peach in the picture. it also was more clingy than a curvy woman like me can wear. i thought'd be more swingy but it was more structured. very pretty and good quality,tho.",0
"I feel that for this price, i should love this top (and i wanted to). however, the price is on the high side for a relatively basic top, and there were a few things about it that could be improved.
pros: i ordered a medium and feel that it's pretty true to size. additionally, the fabric is nice and light (but also *sheer*) and, generally speaking, has a nice pattern. overall, it's a very pretty top.
cons: there's a cute criss-cross ruffle thing happening in the back but the model has cleverly",0
Much lower quality than other robes i have purchased,0
"I wish i had read the other reviews before purchasing this product. label says that you can wash and dry normally. however, upon washing, the outer layer shrunk and the inner lining did not. the robe will now not lay flat; the fabric pulls at the edges, and results in the inner lining being revealed when the robe is tied shut. extremely disappointed. for a $100 garment, i expected much more. i wish i could return this.",0
I ordered this as a gift and may order myself one. it is so comfortable and pretty.,1
"Loved these culottes! flattering fit and nice drape. the fabric, though poly, is of a nice weight and swishes nicely as you walk. the length (just below knee length) works for me too. the color is lovely for the fall - rich copper and easy to pair . i'd say these are tts but if in doubt, size down. i""m between a size 8-10 and the 8 works best for me.",1
I ordered these culottes because they looked comfortable yet elegant. they are indeed both!,1
"So bummed. i was really hoping this top would work for me. i got the black in regular size 4 and the pink in petite size 4. both hit my breast too high and were too bulky in the mid section. i have a sort of short torso, wear a small 34c, and am have a defined waist. when tops are bulky, it gives me no shape and just looks terrible. i am having the hardest time finding pretty tops that suit my figure. they did not lie flat like on the model but had so much extra fabric they stuck out.
the constr",0
"I have been looking for a tan color skirt so i ordered this as soon as i saw it. so glad i did the deep camel color can still be worn in late summer as styled in the product photos and transition to fall staple. the material is nice weight , and has a stretch. the cut has a little 60's vibe that i love. i think it should keep it's shape hopefully launders well. i think it runs slightly large, as my waist is large in comparison to my hip proportion and there is no pinch for me. i will rebuy this",1
"This is a beautiful piece but the cut is not flattering. i ordered my usual small and while the top fit, the fringed part was huge, kind of ""maternity."" i can only imagine there was some clothes-pinning going on for the photo. this would have been great if it had about 4 inches of fabric removed from the lower part. obviously, it cannot be altered. so sad, must return.",0
"Cute and comfy. if you don't throw a leg out like the model above, it mostly reads as a skirt because the legs are so full. but it's really comfortable, and pairs well with a surprising number of tops",1
"Love this vest! saw it and bought it instantly. i'm 5'8"" and slim and got the xs. it fits perfectly. there is a lot of ""puff"" to it, but it's really warm and soft.",1
This skirt is stretchy and really comfortable. i love the color. the only complain is it gives a little magnification to the low belly- on me at least. very flattering for the behind though.,1
"This style of shirtdress usually fits me perfectly, however, this did not fit me one bit. the waist was too large, the length too short, and the hips too small. i was really hoping this would fit, since it's a unique color and the material is substantial but soft. i will be returning this.",0
"Tried these on out of sheer curiosity -- i've got a long torso & was pleasantly surprised how flattering they are! they manage to look flowing & sleek without shortening the legs. took a size 6 with my 27"" waist, 37"" hips. it's a bit of a generous fit, especially around the waist, but they're extremely comfortable & have room to tuck tops into. i have the cowled sweater tank in gray & it looks fantastic over these! couldn't resist getting both the rust and black. perfect for a dressy casual look",1
"Not a huge fan of this dress, will be returning it.
fits too big and not flattering.
fabric is thin and shows any lumps and bumps you may have.
color is not as pretty in person as in the photo - the photo looks like a nice rust color but the dress is actually a boring brownish olive.",0
"Well made. color is great, goes from summer right into fall. looks good with sandles and will wear with boots later on. goes well with classic tee, denim shirt or plaid blouse. has a retro/ classic look.",1
"Love this skirt. super comfortable, yet nicely tailored. roomy pockets always come in handy. the dark mustard looks great with the black and white tops that dominate my closet. this will be my go-to skirt for the fall for both my business-casual office environment and weekends out and about running errands, etc. i agree with the other reviewers re: sizing: because of the stretch, if you?re between sizes, you should size down. i'm usually a medium, or size 8 or 10, so i got the 8. i may have been",1
I tried this skirt on because i liked the green color thinking that the pockets would not be flattering to my size 12 figure. i was wrong. the pockets are flattering to a round tummy. the pocket flap is stitched down on the side and button near the center so they don't stick out. a good skirt for fall.,1
"Fabric is a little thinner than i expected, but just wore a camisole. the waist is a little short. nice batik-like pattern and feel.",1
"This is the worst shirt i have ever tried on from retailer. it is basically a big shaggy box from the front, and from the side it looks like a tent. it is also short.",0
"I have a few evening functions this month and the next few months and i thought this dress would be different and fun. i really wanted to like it, but i could not. there were spots missing sequence, some fell off as i tried the dress on, and i did try it on twice. each time there were some on the floor. they are sewed on so poorly, for the price of this dress. i fear it would be a dress for one season and i'd have to throw it out. not for that price. so back it goes.",0
"I ordered the white in this. i found it to be so much prettier in person than the photos. i don't think they do this piece justice. i am normally a medium and that is what i ordered. i found it fit true to size. love the three ties in the back. it's a tad baggy, but looks great. i can see that this might snag easily though.",1
"I loved this tunic the first time i wore it. i ordered it in the red and it was very flattering on my post-pregnancy figure and extremely cute with leggings and boots - just what i wanted. it fit true to size, even with a few extra pounds around the chest area. imagine my horror when i pulled it out of the wash - having followed the directions on the tag exactly - and discovered it had shrunk and no longer fit properly. in particular the sleeves became incredibly, uncomfortably tight and much sh",0
"I really liked the look of the orange so ordered an xs. i prefer a s petite but it is sold out. the xs arrives and while i still like the color, the fit is really weird. the cowl is very high up but the sleeves are still long. it looks nothing like the photo. i cannot see how the cowl sits on the model's collar bone. despite eliding the color, the design is off so have to return.",0
This sweater was so itchy i immediately was turned off. it looks cute in pictures but another problem was that the knitting in the shoulders looks like a kid made it. it was uneven and stretched out. it looked like it was not well made to me. it also shed so much that just from me trying it on my pants were covered in orange fuzz. i returned this one.,0
"This sweater was just okay. i am happy to pay $100 or more for a sweater but this one was somewhat itchy, and not the quality i expected for that price. i may have kept it if it were at about half the price, but it just was not worth it. retailer prices seem to be going up and up and the quality less and less. i had similar experiences with a couple of shirts that i ordered over the summer. looked great in the photos, but unfortunately in person were not quality garments.",0
"This sweater is absolutely lovely. i bought it in the sky color which is so pretty, the picture just doesn't do it justice! the yarn is super soft and it seems as though it will be plenty warm this winter. i also love the retro 70's look. a definite keeper.",1
"I wanted so badly to love this sweater. the colors in the blue motif are fabulous and the yarn is soft and warm. but it does not fit me in a flattering way. i can't recommend a size, because the s and the m were exactly the same size and fit. the neck is broad and bulky and overwhelming, the sleeves have bulky cuffs that come down to my fingers, and the sweater slides across my shoulders. i'm 5'6"". it appeared overstretched, and i feared it would only stretch out more over time and not be worth",0
"Omg i love this sweater. it is minimalistic yet romantic. my mother in-law bought this for me last may when she was visiting and one for herself. i saw it today at the store in white and i snatched it up. i will wear this for years. i did not see until now that is is meant to be worn with the ties in the back. i've been wearing it with the ties in the front. what a bonus that there are 2 ways to wear this wonderful sweater. i will wear these 2 pieces for many, many years.",1
The sweater is beautiful. i loved the tweed design. but the fit was boxy and the collar sat funny. so i had to send it back.,0
"I'm glad i checked out the reviews before purchasing - i went a size smaller and the sweater fit perfectly! i love the taupe color - it's feminine (not overtly so) and i can still use it as a neutral. the quality is really quite good, though i would still suggest keeping metal accessories (without smooth edges) away from the fabric. it's also not too heavy so i can still wear this despite the heat and humidity in honolulu. 

i think the only thing i would consider changing would be the materia",1
"This sweater is a lovely color and very soft. however, the sweater 'sheds' terribly and the color is very large distracting from the overall appearance. it's also thin and whatever shirt is worn underneath will show through.",0
"Beautiful, comfortable and attractive sweater! my neckline doesn't stay flat as the one in the photo does, but i love the sweater anyway. great quality, attractive, and comfortable.",1
"I liked the look of this online, but it's even nicer in person. just the right length on the hips, a medium weight, and with enough interest and exposure on the shoulders to make it feel like a stylish option for a slightly cool night without falling into the too-heavy and makes-you-feel-dumpy category of sweater. like the slightly short sleeves too.",1
This has a classic tunic style silhouette with delicate gold threads. it looks even better in person than online.,1
The material is very nice. not flimsy at all which is nice. the problem was the fit around the arms. i am a petite person with a small chest but it still didn't cover me bra. i'll be returning it.,0
"I really like both colors in this top. i love the way it lays, the length, the material, etc. what i don't like is that the arm holes are very large and shows the entire side of your bra. this is definitely a summer top so why would someone want to have to wear a cami when it's warm enough to go sleeveless? too bad, i would have bought it for sure.",0
"I liked the quality of the top and the design. but when i got a top that fit well across the chest, it was shorter than i usually like my tops, so i will be returning it.",0
"I was so excited to buy it online, but it come in a small plastic bag, and lot of pieces are missing on the one i got, so i had to return it",0
"This top is very nice. i ordered it in black, it looked very good. the embroidery and pleated details give it a very nice look. the fabric, however, feels like heavy cotton. it didn't feel very soft and comfortable, it was a bit hard for me to wear because i usually prefer soft cotton. while i think this will retain it's shape and not stretch like softer cotton, i am sending it back. it felt a bit heavy to wear.",0
"Love this blouse, however upon every time i wear it, a new button pops off. i have had to replace every button!",0
"Great looking shirt that i bought for my wife, but poor quality. the fit is great but the buttons literally keep falling off. first time my wife wore it two buttons just fell off. when she was sewing them back on she showed me and another button just came off with the slightest tug. its really too bad because it looks great otherwise.",0
I picked this dress up to take into the dressing room to try on without looking at the price tag. im typically a small and he dress in store was an xs but because of the wrap i figured i'd try it anyway. this dress is to die for! the xs fit me just fine (though the snap at the chest wouldn't stay closed but i thought it looked ok). i looked at the tag after falling in love with the dress but left the store without it. i'm contemplating purchasing it still because i can't stop thinking about it!!,1
"I ordered this top on line. i wanted to love it, but unfortunately the fit was not for me. i am 5'9 with a long torso. this top was cut very wide and looks like a maternity top.",0
This style is very pretty and flattering. i love the flow of the material and the open shoulders are nice for the design,1
I usually wear a 27 in pilcro and for these i have to size down to a 26. the 27 was very large in the waist. they are a great dark denim color and look cute with the bottoms rolled up a little.,1
"I'm 5'7"", 135 lbs, slender bone structure. the medium fit well in the front but hung to the back of knees in back...just way too long. it would work best on someone closer to 6' tall.",0
"I love the way this top looks in the picture and the embroidery is as lovely as it appears--very detailed. it is both subtle (not cheap looking) and special.

as an earlier reviewer noted, the top is not see-through, a plus.

the drawbacks, though, mean that i will be returning this top. 

1. the fabric is very heavy and does not drape well. i am a small woman with a large chest and ordered a size 0. the top is still loose, even in that size, and the relative stiffness of the fabric gives",0
"I was so looking forward to receiving this in the mail! when it arrived, i was very disappointed. the color is more mauve than dusty pink, and the fabric is stiff and wrinkled.....not at all what i expect velvet to be (flowy and soft). the fabric seems very cheap for the price point.  i usually like floreat, but this one is headed right back to the store!",0
"The positive: light-weight fabric, interesting drape

the negative: i'm tall and would have preferred if it was longer. the big drawback is the ridiculous buttons--three fell off the first time i wore it...and it fits loosely! they're held on by a single loop...ugh.",0
"I'm wearing this top today at work and i feel very cute walking through the hallways. it's a little long in the back, because i'm short, but overall i enjoy wearing it. it's comfortable, casual, girly, and well made. i'm happy with it.",1
"Beautiful print, however as the previous reviewer mentioned it is very sheer, much sheerer than the product shot shows. i was expecting to be able to wear a nude bra under this without a cami, however my nude bra was completely visible.
the top also ended at the middle of the zipper of my jeans, so much shorter than the tunic length shown, and the bottom half of the sleeves ballooned out much more noticeably in person (the top half of the sleeves are slim, and the bottom half are looser).

"This is a beautiful top if you size way down. i normally wear a small in tiny tops. i had to buy an xxs petite in this top. even still there is a little extra material around the sides, but i've received a ton of compliments on the top.",1
I personally didn't like it enough to purchase but it is a well made top. in the photos i am wearing a medium and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40.,1
"This shirt is adorable.
but...it didn't work for me!
i'm a smaller gal with a large chest (5'4"", 34g). i tried on the small, since it seemed so flowy and large. the sleeves were tight, yet the back of the shirt flowed way too much, making the shirt look huge on me. perhaps a more fitted back, and i would have been in love.
love the blue color!",0
"Love this top, it looks just as pictured. the lilac color is just as it looks, which i am happy about. sometimes this shade ends up darker than it appears online, but not with this top. it is soft velvet, silky lining and hits right where it does on model. i got a pxs my usual size. i am 5'3. the neck is a bit tight once buttons are buttoned up, but again this is pictured. well made and very pretty. can dress up or down.",1
"I love belted sweaters, but this was way too low in front. it hung almost to my knees in front. i'm not a fan of that look.",0
"I do not think i could express how much i love this top! it is so flattering and soft. i love that the bottom half is slightly sheer and a different fabric than the top. it is stretchy, which for me is a wonderful thing. i purchased the day it came in store. it is quickly prone to pilling though!! with the style of shirt it's not so bad, but kind of unfortunate for a top that is almost $100.",1
"I reserve my 5 star reviews for products that are made well, are a good value and have great style. this is one of those rare gems!

the top is just beautiful in person. very lightweight, almost voile-like cotton, so soft and drapey (and yes, you will need a base layer, it's meant to be very sheer) and the crochet and lace insets all over the top are stunning. 

the fit is somewhere between tts and slightly oversized, but the shoulders are pretty tts which means it avoids looking like you're",1
"I feel like i have a lot of blouses like this so it really needed to wow me to keep it. and while it is lovely, well made and very pretty and delicate...i just didn't feel like it was anything special. if you don't have a blouse like this, then it is a great find. but it is nothing super out of the ordinary... fit i feel is tts...i am in between a m and l...i ordered the l. lots of room in the body although i didn't like where the arms hit on me. they aren't wrist length but they aren't mid-fore",1
"The top on the model in the photo is a true ivory, but the top in reality is more beige. well, i'm blonde with fair skin, so i'm not sure this is going to work. it also looks more dressy in the photo than it does in reality -- i think the ivory color on the model and the pleats only down the front make it look more dressy -- but in reality, with it really being beige, having pleats everywhere, and being a crinkly fabric, it looks more casual. i had wanted it to be more dressy to pair with skirts",0
"This sweater looks exactly as represented in the picture. the detail on the cuffs, neckline and hemline make it unique and set it apart from the typical patterned sweater. i've worn it twice already and i'm very pleased.",1
"I was so excited for this to arrive. at the end of last summer, my favorite shirt (you know the kind - dresses up or down with ease - it's your go to for work or a night out with friends) was ruined and i have been searching for the perfect replacement. i thought that this would be a good contender, but i was ever so disppaointed when i opened the bag...

firstly, the base color is not accurately represented in the photograph - in person its more of a peachy off-whte instead of white. still pr",0
"This is a very flattering blouse, but it should be noted that holding horses tends to run large in size, so order down. the fabric is 100% cotton, gauzy and light. it is very soft on the skin. i was a bit uncertain whether to keep it at first because it required a bit of adjusting in the way it falls once on, but i decided to keep it and i'm glad i did. it is nice looking with jeans and leggings because the back of the blouse is longer, and because of the lightness of the fabric, it does not app",1
"A sales associate suggested this top and i'm glad she did. it's easy to miss at first!

pros:
- beautiful detailing at the bottom that isn't as evident from pics here. it really sets the top apart.
- double-layered but breathable fabric means no see-through issues and can be worn in the hot summer months ahead.
- lace detailing at the top is nice and elegant.
- roomy without being too boxy. nice flow.
- great fabric. forgiving fit.
- can be dressed up or down.

"Love this skirt! the material is so soft and flowy, but holds a nice a-line shape. i do agree with the other reviewers that this does run a bit small. i am a 26"" waist and purchased a 4... and i could probably have considered sizing up to the 6 easily as well.",1

"The fabric at the trim and shoulders is crepe, which isn't clear from the photo. much nicer in person than online. runs large. i wear a large in knit tops (36d and to hide a soft belly) but this large was too big. armholes showed my bra and it was rather wide and boxy. i'll exchange for a m because i think i'll get a lot of use out of it this summer. a casual tank with a little spunk. cute!",1
Definitely was disappointed in the fit of this potentially very cute shirt. just too large; too much fabric for me. i'm usually an xs and there was just no shape to that size for my small bod. i wouldn't have minded the longer length if there had been a better fit up top. i think the colors are also a bit duller in person. love the concept though!,0

i love beautiful and unique socks! so i thought i'd give these a chance. i like them so much that i bought 3 more pairs of the exact same sock now that they're on sale!

two things i noticed... the way the sock is knit, when you put it on, it no longer has a matte black look in the black areas. it is sort of a stretched, slightly two-tone look.",1
"Loved the color and looked super cute in the photo but when i got it home it was way too big in chest area, waist area & too wide at bottom. i'm pretty small but i'm not sure what the right body shape would be for this.",0
"Skirt fits true to size, i bought a regular size 2 even though im only 5 feet because i didnt want it too short. the size was perfect as it hit right above the knee. bold, vibrant color and great quality! also very unique, which is what i look for at ahtro. recommend, give it a shot!",1
This has a sparkle that you can't see in the pictures. i returned it. the design is cute but not worth the price.,1
"I have a gala to attend next weekend and can't wait to wear this beautiful cape. i'm a big fan of nanette lepore
clothing and this cape does not disappoint. it is absolutely beautiful....chic and elegant.",1
"I love this skirt for so many reasons! 
one, it isn't a circle skirt, per se, which is good. i am hip heavy and don't need extra volume at my hips. so while it's called a circle skirt, the description states that it's a-line. based on that, i was willing to risk it. also, i am 55 and tend to stay away from above the knee dress and skirt lengths (just my personal preference). although i am only 5'2"" i ordered the regular size 10 for the extra length and it's exactly at my knee; perfect for me.",1
"I got this top in my typical size medium and wanted to love it...it is such a good idea and i loved it on the model! however, it failed in translation for me, and i will be returning. the bottom of the top is very loose, but the top clings to my chest (36dd), pulling awkwardly and gapping on the sides. not worth exchanging for a large, since the bottom of the top is already to loose..",0
"I've been waiting to purchase this top for some time, thinking it would be perfect weight for fall/winter. i'm pretty disappointed. since i don't live close to an retailer, i typically order a size up to avoid returns and usually end up with items that fit just right or a little loose which is no big deal, this sweater however i was swimming in, like a child in an adult sweater! it was huge! and not to mention unflattering on my short fuller shape. i wasn't impressed with the material either, it f",0
"I was so excited to try this on--but this was a big nope for me unfortunately. i ordered both an xs and s (i normally wear a s), both hung horribly on me, they were just too big. i love a boxy, oversized silhouette but this sadly didn't flatter me in the least.",0
"The quality of the shirt is top notch. the fabric is lightweight and comfortable.
now the cons:
this top is cut like a square and fits wide which is not apparent in the photo. definitely not for me.",0
"I love these socks so much! i ordered the beige and red pair with the polar bear design and they are my new favorite socks. these are comfy, with great stretch and just the right amount of cushion. however, the best feature is the cute little frill around the cuff! i want to order more, but i don't care for the other designs as much as the pair i ordered. instead, i will be keeping an eye on this brand to see what they come out with next!",1
"Purchased the gray patterned top. seemed to fit tts, but it didn't fit me. i'm an athletic build with a 34d bust and it just wouldn't fit right around the shoulder/neck area. i'm pretty confident it would fit someone who is less busty than i. the double-sided fabric was soft and felt like it would wash/wear very well. nice length all around...top and sleeves.",0
"I so wanted to love this sweatshirt. it is very soft and seems like excellent quality and material. the pattern is pretty, and i envisioned spending hours cuddled up reading in it. unfortunately, the body of the sweatshirt (particularly the front torso area) was too big, and it popped out around me like a balloon. the arms fit well, so i don't think that i could have gone down a size. i was also not keen on the way the neck hung, which was either very stiff and tall around my neck when unfolded",0
"Fabulous colors, great fabric, super comfy and extremely versatile. i love, love, love this skirt. although i'm only 5'1"", the regular 2 was still above my knee so it might be a bit short for really tall gals. the waistband is a bit wide, but with a cropped top or tying a button down as shown, i found it very flattering. love the texture of the fabric and the slightly retro print and it doesn't seem to wrinkle (after getting out the original packaging creases). it honestly goes with everything a",1
I was surprised by the other reviews. expected to live in this all winter but found the style bulky and awkward. the hi-low cut with so much bulk just wasn't flattering. i wish the armholes had been larger so that the body of the shirt would have fallen closer to my body. the armholes are the size of a fitted shirt which pulls the shirt wide rather than allowing it to drape a bit more. it is incredibly soft but just not as comfortable as i'd hoped. it went back.,0
"Love the knit. contrast stitches add interest. quality is great and it is true to size. very happy i made this purchase, especially because i caught it on sale after eyeing it for months. great with denim or a black dress.",1
As a texas girl growing up with cheap hand embroidered tops from mexico - this is a treat and takes that style to a new level. quality fabric and workmanship in a unique sleeveless design! perfection.,1
"Aside from the beautiful colors what drew me to this skirt is the wide waistband! i love that it can hold in a bit of a tummy and accommodate a belt (or not). when i received this in the mail a few days ago i immediately started pulling articles of clothing out of my closet to go with the skirt - a striped tee, chambray top, belt, denim jacket. the quality is great and it has pockets. i have a 30"" waist and went with my usual size 8. i am 5'5"" and ordered a petite. so it hits a couple inches abo",1
Fits like a maternity top. not for my age group or build.,0
Weave on the sweater quite open and easily snags . the first day i wore it the seam on the sleeve began to unravel. needed to use a crochet hook to reweave after the first wearing. not confident that it will hold up well to its first wash.,0
Super cute shirt. really flowy on the bottom - good if you want to hide your middle. great quality material.,1
"Super cute, a little buggier than expected but great for layering after the gym.",1
"I was really excited for this sweater, its not terrible but its not great. the sweater was large making me feel like a blob in it. it is warm and the fabric is pretty there was just no shape to it. i would try a different sweater.",0
"I love everything about this top. it is high volume and looks good with either a skinny pant or a structured voluminous pant. very sharp, but feminine and frilly look. i love the juxtaposition.",1
This is a great dress if you don't want to leave the house or you want the world to see your nipples.,0
"The picture is not a good representation of the cut and the fabric. the cut is a-line, trapezoid-shaped. the shirt is smallest in the shoulders and chest and then it flairs out to the sides. the cut works with pants mostly, you have to tuck the shirt in if wearing with skirts. the lace back drapes beautifully and is a little longer than the front, which again lend to wearing with skinny pants and such.
the fabric has a quality of freshly starched. pleasant surprise. it lacks softness of leisure",1
Very flattering dress in a comfortable material. the cut is perfectly placed. this is very long. i'm 5'11 and in flats this touches the floor. easily dressed up or down with the tight accessories.,1
"I was so bummed when this came in...the colors and print are beautiful, but the neck is super itchy because of an elastic/ruffle combo. there is also a liner which is a nice touch, but it's significantly shorter than the top layer which drove me nuts. definitely going back.",0
"If you are on the shorter side, do with the petite size. i ordered both (at first, petite was sold out) so glad i got to get it. i looked lost in the regular size, the back length was well below my bum. both colors are really nice, but i did end up with the orange one, more ""dressy"", red one looked more calsual (though it is a casual shiryt, i had on trousers, and hte orange looked nice with them).",1
Wasn't crazy about this top. it looked great online but in person it's just a boring and lifeless top.,0
I tried the yellow striped dress on in the store and it is completely sheer.,0
"Ordered this top online and wanted to love it but the fit was very off. i love the drape in the front, but it did not hit in the right place. the fabric was soft, but not as high end looking as i was expecting. i love flannel tops and wanted a more formal look, but sadly this is going back.",0
"When i first saw this shirt online i was so excited! it reminded me of why i love shopping in the fall! unfortunately when it came i was so disappointed. in person the fabric and the colors are gorgeous. it's fairly lightweight for a flannel but so soft and comfy cozy. i love the navy/cream polka dot that is on the inside of the cuffs and collar as well, and the buttons are cute too! when i put it on it was so comfortable, but it made me look like i was pregnant! especially from the side it just",0
"My 3 daughters and i all wear a size small and are heights range between 5'2 and 5'10 . this dress was sloppy on every one of us. i don't think a size x small would have made a difference. the length is all over the place .i""m not sure how or where you would fit a bra into the picture. on the positive side was very soft. it may work as a beach cover -up.",0
"Tried this twice in yellow because for the price it seems like it would be such a useful piece, but the quality is below average for an retailer dress. it's just a shapeless, thin, beach cover-up that i could've picked up anywhere. the yellow color is so cute though. if you're looking for a light, breezy, go-to-the-beach dress that you can shove in a bag with your towel, this might be good for you, but it's too thin for just about anything else.",0
"I purchased this in the yellow xs. it is very comfortable, but extremely see-through. you'd have to wear a slip or something underneath it, but i'm not sure what would work based on the style, and even if i wore a strapless bra it was still see-through. unfortunately i had to return it.",0
This is a gorgeous buttondown. the colors are stunning - i love the mix of blue and brown. the fabric is super soft and drapes just right. i feel the this shirt runs true to size. i'm an xxs petite and it fit perfect. this one is a winner!,1
One can't tell from the picture but the top shoulder part is sheet and transparent. it also is very long almost dress length.  feels less quality than what retailer usually carries.,0
"I feel in love with this piece. the color are gorgeous and i received so many compliments. it lifted my mood just wearing it! sadly, ut the end of the first wear i had a run up the front and by the middle of the second wear the light fabric got caught on something and a hole developed. upon further inspection i found another hole at the top where the price tag must have been attached. i also noticed all over pilling after the first wear! so sad! they should recreate this in a heavy fabric.",0
"Read the reviews and thought i would just remove the label asap to prevent snags since i loved the item! 
however, the item came with unrepairable holes, not just snags and they are either on the neck or front sleeve which forces me to return the item asap. didn't even try it on. so sad, but i still love retailer!!!",0
My favorite for work or going out. the perfect black shirt.,1
"I generally don't write bad reviews, but there is a real discrepancy between the quality of this kimono and the cost. the design and colors are great, but the fabric is ripping on all the kimonos on the rack in my store where the manufacturer's tag is at the back of the neck. the material is very thin, so there are other small holes beginning throughout the garment. i shop at retailer all the time, and this is not a $98 item of clothing.",0
"I tried this on in the store, and the fabric is lovely - so, so soft and drapey. the skirt is very flattering - good length. but the zipper! the zipper was already ripped away from the fabric, so i wasn't able to purchase it. such a shame.",1
"Beautiful fabric! unfortunately, i had to return it. after just one wear, it had pills all over the side. fabric is too delicate. sad to return!",0
"I didn't realize when i ordered, that the hem is unfinished below the seam.. i'm not a fan of this look, especially in a more expensive skirt. the fabric is nice and flowy.. but i do feel there is maybe too much of it(which may be a plus if you wanted a fuller skirt) and that the waist runs slightly small. i am normally a 10-12 and ordered the large and it fit at my natural waist, rather than hanging lower and looser like other styles in this shape. i am 5'7"" and i do like fuller skirts, but was",0
"Love retailer's kimonos and when i saw this pattern i had to have it! unfortunately, when i bought it the tag was already showing holes so they gave me 15% off... went to wear it for the first time, there was already a huge snag in it! i love retailer but for 98$ this is not worth your money.",0
"I got these pretty boy shorts because i was looking for a panty that was comfy for bedtime--pretty but with a fair amount of coverage. i am really happy with them. wonderful with a tank top or chemise. i think the ruffles are a bit bulky for skinny jeans, but i love them for sleeping. they feel special.",1
This is super cute and the colors are so vibrant and its thin enough to wear with tanks for the summer but it already had a hole forming in the upper back shoulder.  i guess the material was a little too thin....$98 is a little too much money for something that gets holes so easily!,0
"The colors on this kimono are amazing and i really loved it, however, i too noticed the 'delicateness' of the material. it is so delicate that parts were starting to fray - including next to the kimono's label. so sad.",0
"At first, i thought that this sweater would be too thin and show any imperfections, but it doesn't. the vertical ribbing really gives it a slimming effect and it is a perfect lightweight cover up that goes with pretty much anything.",1
"This sweater is much prettier in person than in the picture. the colors are soft and feminine. medium fit me perfectly. this is the soft, cuddly sweater i have been looking for.",1
"This is a great top. i love how it's loose and hangs away from my body but is banded at the bottom so it isn't shapeless. the tie at the neck is cute and gives it some personality.

i usually bounce between a s or xs. i tried the xs in the store but ordered the s.",1
"I'll start by saying the fabric and concept are beautiful. the top is sheer, but that's pretty clear in the images and not surprising for a lightweight white blouse. the problem is that the arms are more fitted and the torso (not the chest, but the mid-section) is cut fairly wide. i'm 5'10"", 140#, 34b and usually wear a 4 or a small/medium depending on how relaxed i want the fit. i purchased this in a 4. the arms were workable but slightly fitted, and the torso fit like an 8. chest was as expect",0
"From the images, it looks like a basic black cardigan. look again because it's a beautiful fabric and can be dressed up or down. i'm 5""1 and always wear an xsmall at retailer however i thought it to wear over other articles vogue clothing i'd size up. it fits perfect i did an xsmall petite and couldn't be happier",1
"This top fits perfect everywhere except the sleeves are a little tight. not uncomfortably so but i wish they had just a little more room so they looked like they did in the picture. other than that, i love this shirt! its super cute and comfy and i have gotten a few compliments on it!",1
It is soft and hangs great. problem - i wore it one time - and the back balled up terrible. it looked like i had owned it for years - not worn it one time. wouldn't recommend. though it is sooooo soft!,0
"This sweater is beautiful, but is definitely more for looks than warmth. it's very soft, but very thin. i prefer the way it looks open rather than buttoned. i got the moss green color on sale, and i am glad i didn't pay full price for it--it's lovely, but certainly not worth $88.",1
Love the softness and the length. the color was perfect. but you have be be a very skinny almost boney person for you to not show imperfections to your body. the fabric is not thick enough and does not have the give to over shadow normal imperfections. will be returning the sweater.,0
"I loved the design of this suit. the zigzag pattern is great at covering up any tummy issues but the print is still fun and not frumpy. i got a compliment the first day i wore it. it is a great one piece that gives great coverage and yet is still fun. the only thing i don't like about the suit is that the top of the suit slips over showing the lining. i read this in other reviews and it is true. while that is annoying, i liked the suit enough to keep it.",1
This blouse is so pretty! i love the neck tie which gives it interest and won't look boring on it's own. i'll wear this all-year round. i ordered an xxs which fits perfect.,1
"Really cute skirt, love that it has hidden pockets in the front. ended up just being a bit too wide on me. can't size down as fits everywhere else. will look great on someone, just not me! order true to size, fits great.",1
"I have a few pair of charlie's and one thing i really like about them is their consistent fit. i own this pair in both the orange and gray, bought both in my normal 4. they will stretch so if they are a little snug at try on don't size up. definitely recommend these pants.",1
Unfortunately this top looks billowy and boxy on my. i am tall and very slim and i look pregant in this one ;). maybe it works better on somebody more curvy.,0
I got the moss color in this cardigan. i'm not sure why these aren't sold out because it is pretty amazing! it is super soft and is a cute addition to a casual outfit. i would say that for this price it's definitely worth the buy!,1
I like the pattern and material on this top but the bubble hem isn't flattering on my figure. i would recommend this top if you are tiny and petite.,1
"These are beautiful pants, especially when you walk, they are simply beautiful and flow nicely. however, they are soooo very long (i am 5 5 1/2) and even with a big wedge's i would have to get these altered. the waist seemed very small, i am a sz 12 (10 in some stores) and i got the large and it was way too tight in the waist and have no stretch or give at all. . probably a sz 10 at most. so unfortunetly they have to go back.",0
This cardigan looked great on line but it is one of the worst things i ever ordered at retailer. the quality is awful and the material feels flimsy and cheap.,0
"Although i haven't worn it yet, it is very soft and functional. i will watch how i wash it so it stays that way.",1
"I love this top! i debated between an xs and a s, but i'm usually an xs in deletta so that's what i got. it fits perfectly and is beautiful.",1
"Material is kind of thick. stretchy. the orange i ordered was just too bright for me. i'm 8/10 and got the 10. i think the 8 would've worked better. sending back, mostly bc the color didn't look good on me.",0
Size 0 ordered .they fit beautifully for the first 2 hours but slowly stretched out and lost their shape sadly.,1
"I really wanted to love this dress.... 

i absolutely love the fabric and the bottom of it. sadly, the top was just too ""balloon like"" and poofed out way too much. i tried putting a belt with it which helped a little bit. if the top had been just a little more fitted this would be awesome. i don't know if a smaller size would have helped the issue... i ordered a small and considered an xs but in the end just returned it.",0
"The dress is absolutely beautiful in person. the blue stripes are a bit brighter and the print on top is more muted. it's unique and sure to turn heads. being 5'2"" i tried on the small petite. this size is usually perfect (lengthwise) for me. however this dress was about 2"" too long. another complaint is the style of the top half. the model in the picture seems to be hiding the puffiness of the top half. the top half puffs out and made me appear much wider than i am. not a good look on anyone.",0
"This may be the ugliest dress with the worst fit i have ever tried. the blue stripes are brighter than they appear in the photo, absolutely garish. the top is baggy with awful beads on the back ties, it just looks cheap. the skirt is an antebellum nightmare.  
i did not even want to try it on, it's that bad. i considered adding a photo, but was too horrified.
for reference, i'm 5'10"", approximately the height/ size of the model, but it was shorter than the photo depictes. i wanted to like it,",0
"I really want to love this dress, the style and colors are so nice and easy. i like the loose flowy feel of the dress. it runs a tad large, but that is part of the style. what bothers me is that the fabric and embroidery is very stiff and itchy, to the point where it is uncomfortable on my arms and body even though it is a loose fitting dress. also, it has lining which is nice for modesty, but with the stiff/itchy factor mixed with lining, it feels a bit cumbersome. i haven't decided if i will k",0
"Thought this would be a great dress for warm days, but alas it fit like a sack. love floreat and have a few of their well made dresses. shame this did nothing for my curves. ordered an 8, usually wear a 10 and it was a tad narrow in the shoulders. if you can sport a loose swingy shape, this is a great dress with nice detailing, but sadly the shape did not work for me.",0
"I love jumpsuits for their style and comfort. i loved the look of this blue silky piece, and the review that said it was like lounge wear you could wear out of the house. i agree that it is like lounge wear, but for me, there were a few challenges.

first, the fit was small. i am usually anywhere between a 2 and a 6 depending on style, cut and brand. i tried the small in this and it was not a flowy look or feel. it was restrictive in the hip area in a way that would make me not want to wear th",0
"Don't be fooled by the photos online. the color is a bright baby blue, not pale blue. it's a beautifully designed dress, however, the material is so bulky and heavy. it's so unflattering. i was afraid to try it on and my fears came true: this dress just hung on me and pulled me down. i wanted so much to love it, but i returned it.",0
"I love this blazer. its perfect for work, and makes a great statement.",1
"I should have listened to previous reviewers. but the dress looks so good on the model in the two dimensional pictures. when it arrived in the mail, i realized this is a mistake. it has no shape, material is poofy and feels cheap. it is going back.",0
"I was so excited to get this! the fabric is beautiful - comfy soft and a great wash/print of blue. it reminded me of the ocean. however, the fit was off. the waist was too high, the length too short, and the straps to long. i was very disappointed. i considered taking it to the tailor before returning. ultimately, i decided to return.",0
"I usually wear a 4, but ordered a 2 & 0 because of the previous reviews. the 2 fit perfectly. the 0 was too snug across the shoulders. both sizes were the same length and width except the shoulders.the material is beautiful and seems very well made. i am thrilled with this purchase.it looks exactly like the photo.",1
"This is so close to perfect, but there's a seam down the middle of the back and they didn't bother to match the polka dots. you can see the mismatch in the second photo. i was about to buy the jacket, and totally in love, when i turned and saw the error. i hoped it was one bad match, but nope, on every one. couldn't unsee, didn't buy. very disappointed.",1
I was so excited to get this top..but it's boxy and a little itchy from the design. i just didn't think it was worth the hefty price. i'm normally a small in retailer clothing,0
"I am typically a small/6 in dresses, but i should have gone with the other reviewers and sized down. it had no shape, but hung like a paper sack. the armholes fit perfectly though, if i had sized down they may have been too tight. i am 5'6"" 140 lb
i will return, too bad because it is a pretty dress!",0
I completely agree with the other reviewers this top is easy to throw on with jeans or trousers and so comfy! i'm 5'3 with a 34ddd chest and i ordered in my normal medium which looks fantastic. and if i wanted to i think i could have sized down for a more form flattering look but i love the ease of this top.,1
"Beautifully made, gorgeous colors. i wanted to love this, but it just wasn't flattering - too ""a"" shaped, not enough drape to flatter.",0
"I bought these and returned them almost immediately. the material looks nice, but itchy and heavy. the fit is too small and just uncomfortable to wear.",0
"This dress is absolutely beautiful! i wore it in my engagement photos and it is so flowy and so beachy. you can dress it up or down and it's very comfortable as well. unfortunately, it got ocean water on it in my photos, so i took it to the dry cleaners and they lost it :-( hopefully it will come back in stock and i can buy it again. it is easily my favorite dress i have owned in quite some time. for tall people - it may be too short to wear with anything but flats. i'm 5'6"" and wore sandals and",1
The dress fits me like a tent and i looked pregnant. maybe this style isn't for me and i even sized down. otherwise the quality was lovely with an embroidered area on the top and the fabric style mixing was great and very trendy. it didn't work for me for the right person this is a very well made dress.,1
"This is a very flattering top. i'm pretty flat-chested & this top doesn't look too bad. i love the subtle peplum - it makes it a bit dressy. i'm 5'4"", 112 lbs & got the xs.",1
"I love these. i like that they're fancier than your basic summer shorts but they still look casual and effortless. unlike the other reviews i found that they run large. i'm usually a 4, maybe a 6, and the 4 is roomy.  still looks good though just rides a bit lower on my hips.",1
"Really loved this dress online and was excited to try it out. when it arrived it was heavy & bulky in the package which didn't bode well. taking it out of the bag, i was surprised at how heavy & thick it was. the picture really looks like it would be a flowy, grecian dress to throw on during a hot summer day ? but in the reality you might drown in sweat. the interior linings promised absolutely no breathing fabric.

wanted to love this as the style is very cute but was disappointed by the mate",0
I bought this dress on super sale and it was such a great deal. sadly it's going back although i sized down i still feel like the dress is shapeless and tent like. no wonder why the store had so many still at the price i paid. the details on the dress are pretty and it's high quality. just wish the fit was better.,0
"I usually wear size 4 for dress, but this is the first time ever i have to go down to size 0, and it fits perfectly. well made, maybe a bit stiff around armholes, nothing major. i love the length as i don't like to show my knees. great color combinations, although this supposed to be a summer dress, it looks great for fall, just need to add a jacket, a pair of boots and i'm good to go, feeling pretty!",1
"I did purchase the pants but ultimately ended up returning because everything such as the print and the length it hits at your ankles is great but there was, at least for me, a lot of extra fabric in the crotch area (and this is not to be crude, there really isn't another word that i can use) and when you sat down, it is extremely apparent. i am 5""6' and run between a size 8 and 10 and 10 fit me, but again, i just think if there was less fabric in the saddle, it wouldn't ride up and look more fl",0
"Runs true to size, with allowance for some bulky clothing underneath for those cool fall days. definitely not meant for winter - so don't plan on this for freezing cold days. the bottom falls nicely over the hips and the color is vibrant and adds some life to any outfit.",1
"As much as i buy from retailer, this is my first review. the pictures do not accurately show how large this dress is in person. i wanted something that was a bit flowy, but this was a reminder of little house on the prairie. the most unflattering dress ever and since it's only available online, i'm not interested enough to try a smaller size.",0
I loved the beautiful print! the sleeves were beautiful as well and added a unique quality to the shirt. i also liked the longer length of the shirt. i ordered online and kept it!,1
"I tried this top on thinking it would be cute for the summer. it looked more like a maternity top with the fullness in the bottom. so if you're expecting, this one would be great.",0
Love love love this mock tank!!! goes fabulous with everything! it's flows nicely the mock neck looks fantastic! you can probably go one size down.,1
"I love the shape at the neck but the lack of shape really distracted me from loving this top. the fabric is nice but the big, boxy shape on the bottom doesn't do much for you. i agree with the other reviewers tha this top would be great as a maternity top because it really is cute if you have a baby bump. returning the top.",0
"I usually get a large in tops that don't come in tall due to my long torso. thanks to the reviews on this one, i got the white top in a medium.  the medium fit perfectly.   it looked just like it does on the model and not like a maternity top at all.  the material is thick enough that the white wasn't see through.  i paired it with some crop skinny pants and a statement necklace and received many compliments on it.  the top is a little bland and needs some kind of jewelry to really make it.  oth",1

it was quite difficult to explain why it did not work for me...
i liked its floral pattern and shape of sleeves.
texture was ok.
usually, i like a cool touch of linen.
but this t-shirt was not as comfortable as the other products made of linen.
i was not quite sure; it just was not right for me.
only word i could think was ""average.""
personally, i do not recommend it, but who knows, maybe it is right for you...
so, try wear",0

"This shirt is beautiful.its very light weight and great summer tee. don't hesitate to buy this, you won't be disappointed.i usually don't buy t-shirts that are quite this pricey, but i knew it might not last till it went on sale.runs a bit large and since it is linen, it will likely stretch a bit.(i have not worn it yet)",1
This top completely fell short for me. i was so excited for it to arrive yesterday and upon opening the package i knew immediately that it was not what i was expecting. in the images online there seam up the middle of the shirt isn't even noticeable but in person it is very prominent...and not in a good way. the peplum is a lot fuller then pictured as well. did not work well with my large bust (34d). returned.,0

I ordered a size small (usually i am ps) but wanted the extra length. usually i can get away with a regular small but not this time. such a cute style but made me look short & wide. unfortunately it's going back,0
"This top arrived today, and after trying it on, i wanted to leave a review to say that the shirt is 100% without a doubt pinned back on the model in the product picture. the fit is designed to be loose, so i don't think anyone could possibly get the same look as the model even if they sized down. i've included a picture of how it fits naturally, and a picture of how it fits the model as i hold the fabric back. it's still a cute shirt, just not the flattering top i was expecting. i'm debating on",0
"This top looks so pretty on the model. however, the photo is deceiving as the bottom section is quite wide and loose. i am petite but between a c+ to d cup. the top is not really fitted, so my bust pushed the top out and made it look like a maternity piece. from the side it hung way in front of my body. i am wondering if this is clipped in the back on the model. if you are smaller chested and taller, this top might look nice on you. i am 5'1"", 105 lbs and c-d cup. i really loved the fabric and c",0
"I really like this top. while it looks somewhat like just a t-shirt, it is not. the fabric is light and soft, it has a great texture feel, it dioes not feel like a regular cotton shirt. the print is lovely. i am very pleased.",1
"I was so excited to receive this shirt and so disappointed when i tried it on. it's a lot fuller than it looks in this picture or maybe it's because i ordered a large? i'm 5'8"", 180lbs, 36d bra size and can fit into a large at retailer just fine but it made me look huge! not flattering at all and it was so full that it looked like a short dress!",0
"I bought the pink one. i like this salmon pink color! not too girly type of pink.
the material is super soft and light. i have skinny torso, so it looks really nice on me not showing thin body...
the only thing that disappointed me was it shrunk after the first wash... it shrunk one size! when i bought it (size s), it covered my flat hips, fits just like the picture, but now my hips are showing :(
i recommend getting a size up if you are too lazy to wash cold & air dry.",1
"Just got this in - love the color and fabric, but it has no shape on me. i thought i'd wear a large because i have a 36ddd chest, but i should have gotten a medium, at the largest. also, even if it did fit, it came with a stain resembling toothpaste right in front. i'll be returning.",0
"The shirt is nice, but not as nice a material as i was hoping, but i kept it anyway. but after washing it, it is even more disappointing, not very soft and now kind of an odd length. hopefully it will grow on me, but wouldn't recommend it especially for the price.",0
"I don't normally write reviews, but this shirt was so terrible, that i felt inspired. 

first off, the seam that is in both the front and back of the shirt is much more pronounced than in the photo. secondly, there is no shape whatsoever, unlike in the photo. it bells out like a tent. it honestly looks like a shirt you would buy if you were trying to appear pregnant when not. overall, this shirt is an insult to the female form. 

retailer, what is with all of these shapeless, frocks in cheap f",0
"I was excited to see this top, ordered it and was disappointed. it was too tight across the chest and had too much fabric around the bottom. i tried this on 3 times hoping for i had been wrong in previous assessments- no luck.",0
"Usually i am a huge meadow rue fan, but not this time. the print is okay, but the shirt seemed stiff and the material was not soft. if the print was just okay but the shirt was super soft or vice versa i would have probably kept the shirt, but since it was neither it was returned?",0
"I have been looking for a soft turtleneck that can be my to-go piece in the cold weather. this fits the bill as far as the material goes. the material used is very soft and even though it seems light in weight, it is actually very warm and not see through at all. i like the feel of this top. it would be pretty accurate to say that it feels as if i am wearing a blanket around me. it is that comfy!!! however, the one detail about this top that i am unsure about is the cut. it is very boxy to the e",1
Size up!!! this dress is great quality and so flattering but tight in the arms and chest. ordered in my usual xs and will regretfully need to return it.,1
"Well, the model looks great and i really like interesting unusual designs as it can be really unique for very long time. i tried and when i opened package it was funny looking tent with several beautiful buttons. fits like tent, long, huge, make me look like i am on military trials and i supposed to be some sort of target.",0
"I'm so glad i splurged on this sweater coat! wow! this is the kind of product i come to retailer from! very unique, good quality, flattering, and surprisingly soft! i wore this over a sleeveless dress for a few hours and not only was i very warm, my arms weren't itchy or irritated at all... on the contrary, it was quite comfortable and soft. this is a bit pricey, but i will definitely get good use of it. i found it to run true to size. i typically wear a 6 and ordered a small. my only quibb",1
"The design of this dress was very off for my 5'4"", 120 lb, 32d frame. it's low-cut and tight in the bust, but then very voluminous and unstructured around the hips, making me look wide there. a belt didn't help much. the fabric is nice, but the overall effect of the dress was frumpy.",0
Love the feel and comfort,1
The fit of these jeans are so great! they look syllish and feel great at the same time. this brand does a fabulous job of creating a jean that feels like you can wear them dressed up and casual. a+,1
"The photo of the mila turtleneck where model has her hands to her sides, and just below her hair, there is a bit of extra fabric which falls to the bottom of the sweater in a bit of a pleat- well, it's not representative of the abundance of fabric in the xl. i usually wear an l or xl well with retailer clothing. the excess added the appearance of excessive pounds from breasts to bottom of sweater. bummer. i'll be returning it.",0
"This sweater caught my eye and the positive reviews and pre-holiday sale had me try it. loved the color and cut but surprisingly not the embroidery. i felt like i'd wear it a couple of times and then tire of it. my husband and daughter both said, ""meh,"" so back it went.",0
"I love boiled wool and have gotten a few items from retailer in years past that i have loved. this one was a fail. i typically wear a small and it was slightly too big and shapeless for me. i am 34c, 127#. the moment i put it on, it felt like i was wearing a bathrobe. it flares quite a bit, and the stitching is brown and not dark grey like i was hoping. the quality is as expected. the color overall is as it looks online. but it was a return.",0
It was purchased as a gift but truly amazing! the quality is fantastic and the owner of the sweater is truly happy with it!,1
The tie jacket is an easy one to throw on for a casual look. it fits well to the body even better than pictured. very comfortable and medium weight so perfect for spring.,1
This sweater is absolutely beautiful. the shape is very flattering both tied in front and in back. the wool is nice and soft and the color is a nice neutral that will pair well with anything. the stitching is a nice added detail that makes this sweater somethig special. it is a great addition to any wardrobe and i'm thrilled that it is part of mine. i can't wait to wear it!,1
"It's rare for a dress to completely not work on me, but this dress completely did not work on me. i'm tall and have an hourglass figure. i got this dress in my usual size s. this dress somehow made me look ridiculously pear shaped. the empire type bust of the dress made both my bust (32c) and my waist look pretty much non-existent. it looked so bad on me i actually laughed. it's a shame though, because i had been eyeing this dress for a long time. and it is a beautiful dress, but i would not rec",0
This is perfect! it fits tts. i am usually an 8 and this was spot on. it isn't too short either. it really is as it appears on the model. i absolutely love it and can't wait to wear it. my hubby definitely approved!,1
"I fell in love the first time i saw it. the xs is the perfect fit. i generally wear xs/s or 2 in dresses. its not too snug to wear over a thin to medium thickness sweater. its a good length also, not too long, which i struggle with given my height of 5'3. the s was overall too big. its not itchy, though i've only worn it with long sleeve tops. its just the right weight. not too thin and not too heavy. its feminine and fun. wonderful topper for jeans, pants, or a dress. the color is versatile. sl",1
"This dress is beautiful and unique - the cutouts and lace really stand out. however, the dress was huge on me and that is rare with moulinette souers. i usually get a 0 or 0p in this brand due to the bust sizing being generally smaller but the 0 regular was huge and the armholes really big. the petite may have been better but felt that it would have been too short. while the design is beautiful, there were several areas on the dress where the threads were unraveling. for reference, i am 24 waist",0
The material looked much nicer in the online picture. also- there are pockets which added a bulk to it that was not flattering on me.,0
"I thought the sweater itself was beautiful, but found the fabric to be stiff and itchy.",0
I wanted this dress to work so badly but if you have any chest or any hips this won't work for you. i tried in petites and regular and it just didn't work at all,0
"Dress is silk? it's soft and pretty. it's blue so you can wear brown or blue suede boots!
i caught my reflection a few times and thought i looked really bottom heavy. dress is awesome. worth it.",1
"Loose fitting and comfortable without losing its shape. 
looks great on. the tie in front adds to the dress. 

i love to wear with tan knee-high boots.",1
"I just got this after ordering online and i was pleasantly surprised. the cardigan has the structure of a lightweight jacket, so it creates a flattering silhouette. i ordered it in a medium, and even though i'm curvy on top it fits really nicely.",1
"This was disappointing to me. i love how this looks on the model. unfortunately it made me look huge. it was all bunched up after i buttoned and put it on. i didn't find it was tts, i am a 10 m and got the m. it was too tight in the waist. before i'd even put it on, i noticed the waist looked very small. i don't even think the sizing issue caused the material bunching. it's like the buttons didn't match up or something.",0
"I read the online reviews that the dress ran large so ordered size 6 and 8. i'm normally an 8 or 10, and the 6 fit perfectly. dress hangs beautifully and lining is really soft. appears that it will wrinkle somewhat easily but i am keeping it anyway since it's so beautiful. the bell sleeves are really cute! i highly recommend the dress.",1
"I passed this sweater a few times during a recent visit to retailer. after striking out on several items i thought would work, i grabbed this sweater in the cream color. i loved it as soon as i put it on! it is meant to be oversized, which i love. the neck is chunky and looks good open or buttoned all the way to make a loose turtleneck. looks great with skinny jeans and booties. i went with my usual xs. great purchase!",1
"I got this sweater with high hopes to wear it with some leggings for christmas. it looked adorable (and long!) on the model. however, it doesn't even cover my butt, that's how short it is. if you're anything over 5'4"", i'd say it'll be too short for leggings.",0
"Totally love this sweater - everything about it i find to match the model pics (fit, color, length). no dry cleaning required on this one, so i plan to get other colors to wear with leggings and skinnies fall through winter. i love that this is oversized without looking frumpy - it does have some shape to it and the knit falls perfects (not a heavy/chunky sweater...think soft mid-weight that you can layer with). worth full price!",1
"I ordered this in a m and it was just a big boxy tent. i really wanted to love it since the length is good for leggings and throwing on to cart kids around. it just was so big and had no shape at all. it's possible i should have sized down to a small, but i'm sending it back.",0
"Let me start this review by saying, 75% of my clothing is from retailer and i love them. my husband bought this sweater for me recently and it's gorgeous, but when i tried it on one sleeve was longer than the other. i went to the store and tried on several sweaters even in different colors and had the same issue. sometimes is was extreme, sometimes is wasn't as noticeable. it was noticeable to me, however, as i am 6' and sleeve length is super obvious when its too short. love the sweater, as it wa",0
"This dress was very cute the first time i wore it, but after my second wear, the bottom layer didn't remain adjacent to the top layer and i found it to be awkward.",0
"The cutout design of this suit looks cute on the model but didn't flatter my shape. i think it would work better on someone very thin. the criss-cross fabric portion was a bit baggy and didn't sit right. even worse, the bust portion made me look flat (and i'm a full c cup).",0
The dress arrived wrinkled so i washed it and pressed it. it looked beautiful until i sat down. the entire dress was wrinkled and it looked terrible all day. can't wear this again.,0
"I absolutely love this dress. i bought this right before traveling to italy for vacation. it was perfect for the hot weather, flows nicely and was comfortable for a whole day walking around. i am usually a small, but this just felt to loose on my chest. i went with an xs.",1
"After reading the previous review, i was pretty confident in ordering this dress. it arrived in the mail today, and i was so disappointed. first of all, it's huge. the medium was way too big on me, and i'm never a small at retailer! (i even considered ordering the large in this - my normal size at retailer.) second, the colors are not as vibrant as in the photo, and the fabric felt cheap. finally, it just looked like i went to hawaii and bought a drab dress there that didn't fit right.",0
"This dress is awesome! love everything about it, except the colors! the pink is ridiculous, it is like pepto on crack, there's no way, outside of being a bridesmaid, i would ever wear that shade of pink. nauseating. i would order the turquoise, but i don't think i want that either. plus the pink was the only color offered in the store, even though i saw the dress offered in black online at one time. why wouldn't you stock the black in-store???? i can no longer get it.

you need to offer this d",0
I ordered my usual size m and when arrived i thought the material and cut was nice.  once i tried it on it was way too big in hips.  i looked rather comical how it extended on the sides.  i returned the dress.,0
"I have a casual oceanside wedding to attend and thought this easy, yet elegant dress would be a good purchase. i initially bought two sizes: 10 and 12. i'm typically a 12 in more structured dresses (i.e., more rigid fabric with zippered entry) but because this dress was flowy and slipped on over the head, i also ordered the 10. i'm 5'5"", broader shoulders, 36d, with smaller hips that are typically one size smaller than my top half. the 12 ended up being comically huge and fit like a tent. the 10",1
"I cannot imagine this dress working in any size. i am a small, thin and average height woman (usually a 25/26 in pants, a size 32c bust, and 5'6"" tall). this dress was huge. i sized down to a 2 ( i am always a 4 in dresses) and this dress was still big... i do not know if i could size down to a 0 though as the shoulders seemed to fit right. it was ginormous. i got it for a wedding in two months and i will be 3 months pregnant, it still wouldn't work unless i was 9 months pregnant and carrying tr",0
Disappointed with the fit and color of this sweater. more of a rusty red then bright cherry red. i ordered a small and found the sweater had no shape and just hung lumpy on me. i am 5'5 120 and usually a small in retailer sweaters.,0
"I hesitated purchasing this because of the high price, so kept waiting and then the petite sizes ran out so i figured i missed it. then miraculously the petite in the green was available so i went for it. this sweater is yummy and cozy. drapes beautifully. i am 5'1"" , short waisted, and wear size 2 in most clothes. the petite s fits perfectly. with a pair of black leggings and high boots, this is a winner outfit for fall and winter. very comfy. the sweater has a bit of an open-weave, so keep tha",1
"I purchased this in the ivory color and love it. very comfortable and agree with reviewer who said it looks good with 1 button or 2 buttoned up. my one complaint is that i found it to be such an open weave that i feel it necessary to wear a cami underneath, which is not the end of the world. the other issue i have: the back is definitely longer than the front, as pictured. i'm not sure why retailer feels compelled to have almost every top they sell have this styling, i don't think its necessary an",1
This top is very cute. but the middle seam in off center near the bottom and cause the top to twist while wearing it. that is annoying.,0
"This dress does run large, but i sized down from med to small and it's a great fit. the fabric is lightweight as silk sometimes is, and is nicely flowy, but might require a slip.",1
"As the other reviewer said, the skirt had this weird bunching on both sides of the hips-it was ridiculous. i don't know how anyone could wear it-looks like you had two little triangle things poking out from each hip. i'm long and lean so usually skirts like this fit me well. very very strangely constructed-i couldn't keep it even at the deeply discounted price",0
"Love this! ordered it on sale, but i really do think it's worth full price! i went with a small even though an extra small would have been good too...i'm slender and 5'9"" about 125# with full bust. the small fits similar to the model, and because i wanted it to fit well in the sleeves (i have long arms!) and length, i went with the small. maybe should have gone smaller as it is roomy! it's very well made and although you'll need a cami, i still feel as if it will be very cozy. perfect for our mi",1
"The light red color is so rich! i would describe it as a burnt coral/red. i love the length - long enough to pair with leggings, but not overwhelming in my 5'3"" frame. one sleeve began to unravel the first time i wore it, but i was able to mend it easily and have had no trouble since. i think it was a flaw specific to my sweater and not s general indication if poor quality. hubby says this is his favorite sweater on me too!",1
"This dress looks like it would be so much fun to wear. when i tried it on, i was swimming in it. i do have to admit that the movement of the dress (had it fit right) would have been very fun. i was also really disappointed with the lining. there is dark green piping along the neckline, which bled through the pink of the dress and make it look like you dropped something on your dress. returning it :(",0
"I do agree with others that the draping does sit a little funny, but its nothing that a simple tack can't fix. this suit looks incredible on, and does a good job of hiding my ""mom pooch"" while still making me feel sexy with the cutouts. also covers the chest area well.",1
"I usually do not buy dresses at full price but when i saw the teal version of this dress on the website i caved in and bought it. i had also tried the pink version of this dress in store. it's very cute and sweet but i don't think i can pull it off. the teal version is pretty accurate in color to the on screen image.

this dress runs huge. i usually wear a 6 or 8 in retailer dresses and went with a size 2 for this one. it fits comfortably without being too baggy or like a tent. the materi",1
I love love love this top and have received many compliments. if anything it runs small (i wear size 6 and a 36d bra and the s was roomy),1

the description said it was black and white.",0

"In love with this. as soon as i received it in the mail i ordered another color. super soft and easy to wear. i imagine i will live in this top the rest of the summer. felt pricey, but worth it for as much wear as i will get out of it. i am 5'10, 160 and the large is a great fit. perfect fit on the shoulders and just a hair loose throughout the rest of the tank, which is what i wanted.",1
"Bought on a whim as a gift for my mom, fit perfectly and she loved the details. did not complain of itching as with prior review. it is more blue than gray appearing the photo.",1
"This beauty caught my eye online and i was excited to see it in store. the coloring is lovely, but it was too short for me (5'7"") and just meh...and it was only on for a second before it started itching. sadly, too, the sleeves were all stretched out from the way my local store merchandised it, which looks cute on the hanger but kind of ruins the clothes (i wish they'd stop doing this). if it works for you, great because it's a decent price for a timeless sweater with an interesting color patter",0
"This top did nothing for me. it billowed in the front and was not flattering. for reference, i am 5""4, 115 pounds, and small chested. i ordered the smallest size the top came in (cannot recall if it was an xs or 0). i promptly returned it.",0
"First off, they are much prettier irl than in the photos online. they fit very large on me. i am usually a 8 or 10 but have hips so ordered the10. wrong decision. i needed the 8.",1
"The fabric was a beautiful color, but the material and seams were not well put together. the elastic in the arm was stretched before i tried on the dress so the sleeves did not fit well. i unfortunately ended up returning.",0
"This is indeed a very flattering dress and looks great - unless you move in it. the fabric shows every little lump and bump on your body as you move and clings to tights (only a little but just enough to make it annoying). if you have any jiggle at all, i'd steer clear. would have definitely kept it if the fabric were different because the cut is amazing but alas.",0
"Would be flattering on someone who is slim with all the right curves. i'm average size and a mother of 3. the medium was not a true medium. the fabric was amazing. the arm holes were too open/low cut for my taste. 
i'm 5'7"" and 140. this landed mid calf. not my preference. 

retailer accepted the return with a hassel free refund all under 2 weeks from receiving it.",0
"Tried this on a whim in store, and it might not look like much on the hanger, but this beauty fits perfectly and is quite flattering! it is loose without being billowy (still has nice tailoring for shape), the fabric is light but good quality, and the pattern is super cute. i was shocked when i saw that the price was much lower than expected - this is a true win, even at full price. for reference, i'm 5'7"" 128lbs and took my usual size s.",1
"This is an ideal top - especially for summer. so lightweight and soft! the detailing is adorable and makes this simple shirt feel very special, yet everyday! i ordered the black, and am back for the other colors! this one is an absolute win.",1
"I came across this in the store and immediately fell in love with it. the online photos just don't do it justice! i bought the white version because the little pops of red in the details and the dobby weave are so sweet and unique. 

a size 0 fit perfectly. the fabric is a bit sheer, so be prepared to wear a cami underneath. very light, airy, and comfortable!",1
"This might look good on you if you are very tall and slim. i am a curvy medium and this was not at all flattering, it is a straight cut and hugs in the wrong places. the color is not true: it is black stripes on gray (not cream). i thought the stripes might flatter my shape, but alas, i did not look good in this.

the material is very nice, soft and stretchy.",0
It is a little roomy so if you're between sizes go with the smaller. i think it's flattering even if you have a larger chest. love the details and the fabric is a good weight and quality!,1
"This dress is exactly what i was looking for for fall events. can be dressed up or down, flowy, suede-like fabric. i normally wear a small in most retailer pieces and even though i am pregnant in my first trimester i bought a small in this since it is stretchy and will fit me at different stages.",1
Gorgeous top! very beautiful and easy. can be dressed up for work or just worn with a pair of jeans. note the fabric is semi sheer so a nude bra or cami is a must with this but it's going to be fantastic for summer!,1
"Just tried this dress on in the store and ordered a petite because i'm 5'. if you are even 5'2"" or taller i wouldn't recommend a petite fit unless you prefer the tunic length. this dress and material has a flattering drape for those of us with trouble belly regions.",1
"I wear between a l and xl..i chose the xl which was the right choice..if you are a bit curvy in proportions, i could size up. the color is gorgeous...i just logged back on to order another if there were options, but alas, there are not. flattering arm cut! could be worn for work, or with jeans/ out to dinner. it's cute, you won't regret it! (as a side note, it is sheer...which you can see in the photo. needs a cami)",1
I bought this b/c it looked exactly my style and i was right! i've worn this once and it is so comfortable and the fit is great. i can see this being a shirt i wear again and again all summer. i bought the black and am thinking about buying the peachy-plaid color...,1
I sew and therefore i can tell when something is cut and designed well. this top hangs beautifully and the colors are very pretty. it's cotton.,1
"The colors on this jacket are a murky blue with a pale mauve tone for the lighter color. size is a bit on the large size. i did not feel that the jacket was that well-made and would hold up to much wear. i was looking for a jacket to dress up jeans, black pants etc and this did not fit that need. it would be a warm jacket if that is a need.",0
"Such a cute shirt! i picked up the white-with-flowers that is not being shown online yet. the straight white looks like it could wrinkle and definitely needs a tank underneath but the white with flowers was not see-through and seems like it will require a bit less steaming (the detail masks wrinkles :)) the flowered-design also has a small tie at the neck that i don't think was on the solid color design (can't totally remember) - cute extra detail but not overly obvious, it blends into the shirt",1
"I bought this in the store without trying it in the black. when i put it on, i loved it. so much so that i went back and purchased the black patterned one. equally as nice.",1
"Adorable fit. the lightweight madras fabric will be perfect for a hot summer day but not see-through. the slightly gathered bottom makes gives my petite frame a taller look. easy to wear, not fussy, no special bra needed.",1
"I love this shirt. it is soft, romantic and flowy.  i love the material it is probably one of the softest things i own. great quality and lightweight.",1
"This can take you from office to casual afternoon. i got the plaid print in store. it is much nicer in person than in the picture. very cute neckline and detailing. i'd say true to size, slightly large. i wore my regular size and it fits fine without looking too large.",1
"I am so love in this top, i wish i had it in all colors and will absolutely be watching the sale rack for these ones. i love this top. i work out at a gym that requires tops, but that means i cannot usually display my awesome sports bras with cute strappy backs. this yoga top has an open back which will show these off, which i really like. the draped back keeps you nice and cool also. and the fit is amazing. i have some extra baby belly that i can't seem to work off-it was invisible in this top.",1
"I love the way this dress hangs straight down on the model, but on me it looked tacky.  i'm 5'6 and 130 lbs, and this dress hit me in all the wrong places.  i got a size small- sizing up would be huge in the top of the dress (and the arm holes are already dangerously large).  i wish this were just a little bit a-line.  instead, it's literally like someone just extended the length of a t-shirt.",0
"I am absolutely in love with this piece! yes it runs large. i'm usually a medium to large in vests ands the small fits me prefectly! the quality is superb. i love the feel of the faux fur, i want to pet it! and the snaps and hooks seem as if they will also last forever. thank you tracy!",1
"I really wanted to love this tank top.  it has vibrant colors and a unique pattern; however, i should have listened to the reviews.  there was way too much fabric!  it made me look pregnant!  the tank top is going to be returned.",0
"Interestingly, the description said this was blue, but as it looks on the picture, it is more grey. that being said, about the zippie: love. my stylist (i brought it in for a try on session at my local store), said, ""you know how i feel about sweats, i won't like it""... joke on her, she turned around and was ok, i shouldn't have looked, love the ruffles at the bottom...it makes this ""sweater"" much more special. it is actually really cute for casual day, jeans t-shirt, kids... or over sweats. any",1
"I usually love bordeaux so i was very disappointed with this shirt when it arrived. the fabric smelled plastic-y which is a first for me with retailer products. when i put the shirt on, i could see it had that sheen that comes from rayon spandex blend shirts, i hadn't noticed that it had spandex in it when i ordered it. this fabric looks and feels exactly like the cheap blends sold at discount stores. i can't believe retailer is selling this.",0
The material is soft and comfortable and the top of the shirt fits well.  when it comes to the bottom part of the shirt there's a lot of extra fabric which makes it balloon out. it made me look much bigger than i am.  i ordered a large (normally i wear lg or xl) and it's possible a medium would have fit better. unfortunately this shirt had to be returned.,0
I returned this as it was way too boxy/loose. ordered a size small but probably needed to size down.,0
These short are the best! the denim is incredibly soft. they go perfect with both casual and nice tops. i would wear them out everyday if i could.,1
"Unfortunately this was too low cut for me,so i had to return it. i wish the neckline was higher. i could tug it up but it slipped right back down. the fabric is a perfect spring weight and the floral pattern is lovely. on me the ties, no matter how i fiddled, didn't cover the cleavage issue and i am a aa!",1
"This dress is perfect, length right below the knee, white slip lining adds to quality, smocking fits upper body perfectly.",1
"Love this vest! i am not a huge vest person, and was worried about finding something to go with this, but i have been able to match it to so many cute thing. the pattern and quality are great. it runs big. if you're between sizes definitely go for the smaller size.",1
Too floppy; light and comfortable material but the tie-neck needs a shirt with a bit more structure.,0
They were too small for me. i loved them other than that.,1
"I really wanted to love this waistcoat. i purchased this online and tried it on as soon as i received it.
it runs large, but i should have realized the horizontal stripes sitting on the hips is not a good thing. the fur adds additional bulk where it is not needed, the hip area !!!!. i purchased a small and could have purchase a xs, but i think the problem would still be there in a smaller size. it's going back, but i am disappointed as i really wanted a something a little alternative !!!!!",0
"Got this on sale in black and red, and have only worn the black. quality is poor, seems to stretch out over the course of the day and loses its shape somewhat. a smaller size may keep its shape better so you may want to size down. not worth full price.",0
"These pants are gorgeous when you first see them. they fit beautifully when you first put them on. and then you wear them for one day. and they snag. on everything. and little strings start to come out of the pants. and the hem begins to unravel. and the pants which were once beautiful light summer pants appropriate for work or brunch are now frumpy, worn out pants with a million snags and strings hanging off of them .... after one day. 

i can't begin to tell you how annoyed i am that i spent",0
"I wanted this top in a petite xs, but it was sold out so i got the xs. i'm 5'2"" with a 34b bust, and while the bottom comes down to my waist like on the model, the sleeves are a bit long...they seem a little long on the model, too. i wore this to work and constantly had to pull my top back as the scoop neck kept drooping down as i moved around throughout the day. really like the tie neck feature though.",0
"This shirt was cute and fit well- true to size- but i felt for the material, it was not worth the $68. the colors offered were a little drab. i thought the grey could work for me, but it didn't. the neck hole looks a little sloppy for a $68 shirt- the roll doesn't lay flat all the way around. would be better priced in the $30-$40 range.",0
I love everything from retailer but this top did not fit all that flattering. the neck line fits a little weird. too bad. color was nice though. i returned the top.,0
Definitely a good buy especially when i bought it on sale! it's warm and can be worn dressed up or down.,1
I wanted to love this dress. it really has no style. i was expecting the smocking to be fitted but it just hung. i considered going down a size but i think the lining would have been too tight. had to return it.,0
"Love this tank. it is so soft and comfortable. the length hits just right on the hip. it hugs the body nicely, not too tight, just loose enough on a hot summer day. i have this in black and white. i wish they would offer more colors.",1
"I am 5'7, the length is perfect, i can wear it with flat. normally the wide leg pants are so long, i have to wear high heels. the flow is perfect too.",1
"Love this vest!. it does run large so definitely size down. i'm 5'0, 110 lbs and i ordered the xs which is roomy around the mid section but i think that's the style as the shoulders hit where they should. it is such a fun and unique piece. i cannot wait to wear it with tights or black leggings with boots.",1
"Got this in the black when i was in greenville nc. i had seen it online for a little while and didn't think much of it until i tried it on in the store. it's surprisingly comfortable and it isn't too heavy. its the perfect ""staple"" black shirt in my closet. it is also very forgiving.",1
Huge with bountiful amounts of extra fullness....not like represented picture. and it snags very easily. i have a 4 mo. old puppy that jumped up on me as i was trying it on and snagged it in several places. 'i'm going to see about returning it with the snags.,0
"Love this blouse. i usually wear a small and had to exchange it for an xs, which fits perfectly. not form fitting but flattering; washes beautifully, too. i highly recommend this blouse.",1
"Just piping in here -- ordered my usual size of small petite. the slip that came with the dress is about a size negative zero, it could hardly squeeze over my body and the dress itself is a bright pale aqua and it is a shift. and because of the smocking it hangs very strangely. i think it looks very cheap and is ill fitting. i would say if you are a person on which shift dresses look awesome you might like this, but mind the size of the slip in the petites range, and also it is aqua.",0
"This is one of my all time favorite retailer purchases. this dress is perfect in every way - mine fits me exactly like the model and i was lucky enough to purchase it in black. if you're on the fence, take the plunge and buy this dress - you won't be disappointed!",1
"I really love the idea behind this. however, the fit doesn't work for me. i'm usually a s or xs in retailer tops, and i often go with xs for sleeveless tops. this one runs small though - the xs was a bit too small on me based on length and width. the neckline was very high (higher than it looks in the model photo) and the armholes were too big. so i don't think sizing up would improve matters much due to the armhole issue. the other criticism is that the front is not lined.",0
"I didn't have as much of a problem with the sheer fabric as the other reviewers, but this dress is incredibly long and large, especially compared to the picture. for reference, i'm usually a 4/6 in retailer dresses and the small was huge on me, particularly on the bottom half. i was very disappointed because this dress looks so cute online!",0
Frumpy - looked like a nightgown on me; maybe  better on someone younger ...,0
"This dress was adorable & fit great! regrettably, i had to return it since it wasn't lined.",0
"I ordered the red in size m. for reference i am 5'8"" with a long-ish torso. i would have been comfortable wearing the sweater with mid or high-rise jeans but it's fairly short. color was gorgeous. the balloon sleeves and seams just seemed too 1980s in a bad way on me. those with small chests may have better luck. i left like a suburban mom in it.",0
"The lace and fit were good. but the length seemed awkward to me given how boxy and flowy-ish the dress is. it felt like a baby doll with sleeves or something. and i hated the ""outside"" middle material, hated it. it felt cheap and odd when compared to the lace. maybe i was just not in the right demographic for this piece.",0
"I really love the style of this top. it's a great lightweight, breathable top perfect for summer. it is slightly sheer so i have to wear a cami underneath. it is definitely a flowy top, but flattering. i'm 5'0 115lbs and ordered the xxs. a petite size would've been better as it is long on me (it covers my butt in the back), but it looks good with a longer short or pants.",1
"I love the design and the fabric, but the fit is just off on this dress. the area around the bust is just not fitted well. the wrap portion of the dress in this area gaps and does not lie flat. that is an easy enough fix with a good seamstress, but the waist also sat too high on me (maybe i'm long waisted, who knows?), so between the super high waist and the flannel-type fabric, it just looked kind of like a bath robe on me. i wish it weren't so. i was so hoping for a cool plaid dress that i cou",0
This is a cute stylish sweater different from the typical. it doesn't itch which is key at least for me. i ordered an extra small but i am normally a small since it seems to run long. i think the neckline is unique :),1
Love this sweater. it fits exactly as shown on the model. the neckline is simple and stylish. the a line fit is very flattering. i normally wear a size xs to s. i purchased the s for more swing at the bottom.,1
"This is one of the lowest quality shirts i have ever received from retailer. i was so excited for the shirt, it looked so pretty and soft in the pictures. the flax is very scratchy, marring the softness of the rest of the fabric. the top half is totally sheer, requiring a cami. the shirt is cut in such a way that it flares out from the rib cafe in an unstructured way, unnecessarily adding visual pounds. finally, the sewing is done very poorly and the the side tag is literally three inches long--wh",0
"These are super cute on. they shorts-length lining inside, which is great.",1
"I ordered this in size xl and ended up returning it as soon as i received it. the color was just as pretty in person. the thick eyelet panel was well done. the problem is the whole tank was much smaller/tighter than pictured. i have several tops from this maker and was surprised how this was cut too small compared to their normal fit. i'm pear-shaped, so the hip area looked terrible. but, the whole top just wasn't up to the typical fitting standards for xl. retailer has done much better in the pas",0
"I so loved this dress online. not so much in person. first of all it didn't fit my build. i'm 5'4"" with a 32f bust and the waist line was just a bit too high to be flattering. mainly i'm returning it because of the fabric. the petticoat netting does rustle as another buyer pointed out. my main fault is that the top fabric is synthetic and cheaply printed. basically it's the lining fabric of a better made dress or coat. if it were cotton voile or silk it would have been beautiful. why they made i",0
"This dress is so so cute. i ordered an xs and it was a bit longer in person than pictured but that's an easy enough fix since i know a good tailor. the problem is that the dress isn't lined. it's made of thin, see-through cotton so it leaves nothing to the imagination. for the price of this dress i would have expected it to be suited for more than just a bathing suit cover-up. without a slip underneath it (if you can find a strapless one) it is unwearable in most social settings. it's such a sha",0
"Honestly, the sweater is really beautiful...i usually buy a small in retailer tops, and this seemed to run on the smaller side. it&#39;s pretty short, but the issue i have is that the sleeves are much shorter in person than on the models in the pictures. it looks like i&#39;m wearing a 3/4 sleeve shirt. still deciding if i&#39;m going to keep it, because it is really a lovely top.",1
"I read the reviews and everyone loved them so ordered them online. for me, they are a no. i thought the fabric was cheap and the quality not so great compared to typical retailer items.",0
Obsessed with black watch scottish tartan so this really hits the mark and goes beautifully with my joe fresh black watch print wellies rain boots. the wrap top is flattering but pulls on me ( i have this in the red and blue plaid as well.,1
"After seeing this dress online and noticing how quickly it sold out, i was curious about it, but thought i was out of luck. it just so happened that i ran into the store and they had one returned in my size. i tried it and wasn't sold. however, i loved the color. it was snug across the shoulders and arms. the rest was somewhat flowy, but boxy at the same time. i ended up bringing it home to think on it. after trying it on again, i realized the snugness across the shoulder really caused the top t",0
This dress is lovely! so flattering. i'm 5'6 and 140 pounds pre pregnancy and just into my second trimester. purchased a 4. will work for many more months and again after baby.,1
"This dress was beautiful in person and the blue is almost electric in color. i wanted to wear this to a party for a club i belong to, however the bust on the dress is to big. i'm 5 ft tall and 115 lbs with 32b bra size. i got the 2p as i was worried about it being to tight. it fit perfect except for the bust. the way the top is cut and the black sheer fabric allows part of the bra to show in the cleavage area. not worth they one to have it altered. will return. sad because it's a fun dress to tw",1
"I wanted to love this dress so much but it just looked frumpy no matter what i did. i'm normally a 14, and i bought a size 12 and it still looks very baggy and not flattering. i'm sad because in photos it's my favorite dress of all time!",0
"This dress was super cute online. i ordered it in small and medium, both fit, one tighter--obviously, but could have gotten away with either. the dress is cut a little funny under the armpits and fell a little weird in front so i didn't think it was flattering on me. it would be flattering on very slim body, smaller on top. i sent it back. i'm a 34 c, athletic build.",0
This dress was sooo cute online and in the store - i hands down would have bought it but i had an extra few minutes so i decided to try it on- terrible! the dress looked awakward on me- the strings lacing strings had town on a few spots and it just was not flattering for a curvy girl. now i know why there were so many in the store! which is a rarity for my location.,0
Agree with other reviewer that this is massive even for a cape. unflattering overall. i normally wear a size 2 of 4 and bought this in an xs and two of me can easily fit into this with room to spare. unlined and it itches!,0
"I loved these pants.they are so comfortable. however, after just wearing them twice, the threads of the leaves are fraying, and leaving lint on whatever i sit on. the leaves at the seat of the pants are now slowly disappearing. this after wearing twice to work! i imagine after a few more wears that the leaves at the seat of the pants will be close to gone, or at least much less ""white"" with threads then the rest of the places. this is super unfortunate and will be returning. too bad, they were l",0
"I am 5ft 8in and about 140lbs-athletic busty build. i normally wear a size 4-6. i ordered this dress in white in a size 6 and couldn't be more pleased! i actually hopped online today to try to order another in the lilac but they are unfortunately sold out. this dress is exactly as pictured-the upper back is fitted, keeping it from going out too much and looking like a straight up tent. i adore it and hope that they will re-stock it!",1
"I am a 6p (5'2"") and got this in a regular small as it did not seem to come petite.  my tailor is taking 5 inches off the bottom as the lower portions (it is an uneven hem) are ankle length.

black watch tartan is one of my favorites - so had to get this dress!

i would say it fits tts.  it is on my shoulders and the sleeves are bracelet length; i have a little extra material around the waist.  the dress zippers up the size and there is an elastic section at the small of the back.  i find th",1
"This dress is so pretty, a true cinderella dress, that's why i can't find a reasonable explanation for such an amazing dress to be made out of plastic. i don't understand much about fabrics, but the dress feels like a waterproof camping tent. i bought a size 14, which is what i wear in moulinette souers (i usually go one size up since i find the rib cage small in this brand), the fit was perfect and the cut was very flattering. i will anxiously hope for a remake of this dress with a better fabri",0
"My favorite features of this sweater are the flattering neckline and the bracelet length sleeves. it's a heavy-weight cotton with a beautiful line. my only complaint is that it seems to pick up lint and things very easily and needed a lint roller even straight out of the delivery box. still, a small issue for an easy to wear sweater that looks great with jeans and boots as well as leggings. a new favorite!",1
"The material feels substantial and decent. however the diameter of the opening for arm is too big, it exposes good chunk of my bra. have to return it. there're also loose fiber of the fabrics, not sure if it is because it's new.",0
"This dress is just absolutely adorable! you can dress it up and wear it to a wedding, or you can dress it down and slip on a pair of sandals and use it as a casual summer dress! this dress does run a tad bit large - i'm usually a size 4 but the size 4 was slightly too big for me. best purchase yet!",1
"I wanted to own this so badly! it ran really short, even with the adjustable slip and was incredibly tight in the shoulders. i could barely get the dress off!",0
"I love jumpsuits and was excited about this one because i liked the print/colors and that it's long-sleeved. i ordered my usual medium size (i'm a solid medium). it was a tad tight in the rear/thigh area (not flattering when you have a thin material which shows every bump unlike jeans) but the length (i'm 5'5"") and top fit well. i returned it and ordered the large but the waist was huge (and that's coming from a person with a bit of a tummy bulge) and there isn't anything to cinch the waist in.",0
"As other reviewers have noted, the fit of this tee is very boxy.  it looks okay tucked-in to high waisted jeans, but otherwise is unflattering.  also, the color is described as black, but mine looks like a navy blue in person.  i kept the shirt because i live overseas and returning it would have been difficult, but if able to, i would have returned it.",0
Kind of excited about this little number. i found it online and was immediately drawn to the boho-chic look. it arrived and i was impressed with the weight of the dress and the detailing that is missed in the photo.,1
"I grabbed this immediately when i saw it in the store - the details are beautiful - beading, embroidery, and small opening details on the arms. from a practicality standpoint, it has pockets, it's machine washable, and it can easily be worn as is, with black leggings or tall boots in fall, and then throw an additional chunky ivory cardigan on for winter. for sizing, i am usually a size s and found it to fit loosely, but in comfortable slightlyyyy swingy way. if i had sized down the shoulder seam",1
"I like the style and the design of this culottes, but the texture of the fabric will caught on any rough surface. i had a few loose loops for just one wear... so it will be nice to wear for work or shopping , but not good to go to the park or play with kids...",0
"I was not so sure i would like this dress as i was afraid it may be too boxy looking. per other reviews i took a chance...i love it!
so sweet with my grey boots and just dressy enough...but still casual and fun.
detail work is very nicely done.",1
This dress is beautiful and extremely well made. there is s little more weight to the fabric than i had assumed but it's nice for fall/transition/cooler temps. i'm so sad that i will most likely return this dress because it's just not working on my postpartum body but there is a part of me that wants to keep it because of how stunning it is.,1
"I ordered this in a small and medium hoping one would work, but the previous reviews were exactly correct, the bodice is way too small in proportion to the rest of the jumpsuit. the bottom has lots of fabric, which wouldn't be bad except you have to go up a size to make the bodice fit, then the bottom becomes overwhelming. i am 5'5"" and 115 so i have a slim build and couldn't get the bodice to zip in a small. the medium would have needed altering, which wouldn't have fixed the extra fabric on th",0
Great dress. fits perfectly. will be perfect in the winter and with leggings.,1
"I adore the feel and cut of these culottes, but the quality has diminished my faith in retailer. picks, piles, and serious wear and tear after just one day. i feel as if i wasted my money.",0
"I had high hopes for this jumpsuit for a holiday party but it is a very odd fit. i'm normally a 10-12, preferably a petite. i ordered this in a large and i couldn't begin to zip it up. it also ran extremely short in the crotch area. very pretty print but it's going back!",0
These are so comfy. i will wear them for 3 seasons. so worth it - especially on sale.,1
"Great fit and dark color; thick yet very soft denim. only surprise for me was that the lacing is in the front (i was expecting it to be on the sides), but i love them anyway!",1
"This dress is amazing beautiful and perfect for fall. the colors and beading are so much better in person. the pockets are an added bonus! i'm typically a xs but sized up to a s only because i felt the sleeves were tight and across the bust was tighter than i'd like when moving my arms. the xs would have worked but the s is perfect comfort. i highly recommend this beauty. for reference, i'm 5'2, 120 lbs.",1
"Absolutely love this jumpsuit. i am 5'2''/103lbs and the xs fits perfectly (i am typically an xs/00). when i read previous reviews i was quite excited to read that most people found it to be ""short waisted""-- the waist band actually hits my natural waist (just how it is pictured on the model), which never happens! great quality, thick fabric and the pleats in the front are beautiful. can't wait to wear it!",1
"These pants are lovely and comfortable, but they are entirely too delicate. i wore them once and nearly any time something touched them, they snagged. i was worried about it when i saw the fabric, and thought i'd give it a try, but i didn't think it would be this bad. for the price, i expect better quality. also, they run a little large- unless i pull the waist down low, it gaps in the back and these look better worn a little bit higher, closer to the natural waist. i'm usually a 4/6, 28/29 in b",0
I love the style of this dress but felt that it didn't look great on. really sad it didn't work out :( felt like it was too short and the drop waist was awkward and looked childish. beautiful fabric and design if it fits you well though!,0
Love this dress!! will go from fall to winter. so comfy. got it in medium.. and fits great.,1
"The fabric, so diaphanous! so flowy! the pattern, so pretty with such interesting colors. it could literally go with anything! purple, yellow, orange, green, they're all in there. but here's the but....

i have no waist! and when you put this type of empire silhouette on me, i look like i'm wearing a sack, or i have some pregnancy news--when i don't. i tried belting it : waist tie is too high; i tried putting on a vest, too annie hall and called too much attention to the sleeves, while adding",0
"Very flattering! i am petite, but have large breasts. so, i expected this dress to look boxy on me. but the flowy fabric falls perfectly on the body and shows just the right amount of shape. the pattern is beautiful and perfect for the cooler seasons. the dress is also very versatile. it can be dressed up with heels and a jacket, or down with flats and a denim vest or jacket. i know i'm going to wear this dress over and over this fall and winter.",1
"There is so much going on on this dress - it's fantastic. hard to tell from pics - but there is a peek-a-boo lattice detail going down the front and back of the sleeves. the beading is plentiful but not too much for work. dress is significantly longer on me than the model - i'm 5'6"", but still a tad above the knee. with tall boots or booties and tights, this will go straight from work to out for the evening. i'm real long waisted - originally ordered m, but exchanged for l. much better fit overa",1
"I skipped over these when they first cme in store, but it was reccomended to me to try them on. so i did, and i loved them, they look like a skirt which is amazing but you won't be worrying on those breezy days ;) they run very big!!!! i'm usually a 26/27 or 2/4 in pants and i got the xs and feel like i could have even sized down but that's the smallest size carried in store. i got them in the green because i felt that the color went more with the casual feel of the pant. if you are interested i",1
Another tent-like tee. this shirt is thin but not in a bad way and the color and design are really nice. but...it is really boxy and i'm just tired of that look. the longer sleeves are a plus for fall.,0
"I noticed this outfit earlier this year and remarked to my husband how heavenly it was. i couldn't bring myself to buy it since i shy away from strapless outfits (this lady is a small chested diva). to my delight- my wonderful husband remembered my gushing, and surprised me with this outfit for christmas! imagine a 33-year-old dancing around the house holding up this outfit - because that is what happened. this outfit it truly a work of art. it has a lined bodice with soft boning that fits perfe",1
"I am here online to buy this pant in both colors. i tried it on today in store in regular lengh,, but am opting for petite size. i am 5'2. i could have purchased the regular length, which hit me above the ankle, but i think p will be more flattering and better for summer.

the pants are a woven material, and kindof shiny!? the pants also may be a bit see-thru in sunshine due to the structure of weave. that said, i am buying them anyways because they are that comfortable and professional. i may",1

"This dress is beautiful, and the a line shape is very flattering. i'm 5'10"" and it hits just above my knees. i'm small on top, so the keyhole slit isn't an issue for me, but it does gap more than it does on the model. this dress has lots of versatility.  like another reviewer said, you can dress it up with heels, or dress it down with boots.",1
"I almost did not buy this dress because of the poly/rayon construction but i saw some sweet styling on instagram that got me hooked. the dress is silky soft and a bit oversized as i purchased the smallest of my size range. looks very swingy and free spirited when worn loose. cinch the string tie or add a wide belt for a defined waist and beautiful full skirt. i have many outfits in mind for this perfect fall dress, i'm excited to start wearing it! my weight has been fluctuating, so right now i'm",1
"This beautiful dress is the perfect style for fall. when i first picked this up, i was surprised by how heavy it felt. there is so much embroidery i thought the dress was lined with another layer. however, the fabric is not stiff. there are numerous exquisite details including a button up bodice, additional embroidery on the skirt and ladder lace on the sleeves. 


i sized up to l because of my heavy back/shoulders/upper arms. sizing up does make the bodice of the dress look a tad wider but n",1
"I am floored by all of the positive comments about these culottes! i can see that they would work for someone who is rail thin and has no hips... but for those of us with curves (i'm a size 12, hourglass), these are very unflattering. they made me look like i was carrying an extra 20-30 pounds, just around the hips! so bummed because they look so cute on the model.",0
"This dress hit my waist in a weird spot and was too short. i would not have felt comfortable bending over. it was a tad too full which wasn't flattering either.
i really wanted to love it bc they design is adorable.
i need to return it!!",0
"I got these in the mail today and to me, they look exactly like the pants my mamaw used to wear in the 80s. they were super comfy but not cute at all on me. they do run large like other reviews say. i am usually an 8/10 or med and these in the small were the right choice. going back because they just look horrible on me though",0
Nice top; the material is soft and drapey. i like to wear it layered under a shorter shirt or jacket.,1
Super cute but the fabric was so thin & flimsy i was afraid it would fall apart once it was washed so returned it.,0
"This does run big but because it is cotton, it easily shrinks in the dryer. i love it! i do wish the color was more saturated/deeper.",1
"This definitely runs a little large, but i love this tee.  i actually went back and bought it in a second color. it's perfect to throw on with shorts this summer.",1
I am usually a regular xs with retailer tops. i took a chance and went with the xxs in blue and am not regretting it. super comfortable top. fits perfect and will be great for work.,1
"This is the prettiest little nighty. it is romantic, soft and so very pretty. i really adore everything about this piece , but the pink detail on the trim, along with the floral embroidery is are just the right extra touches that retailer shoppers have come to love.",1
"Soft very forgiving and flattering top, wish it was not so pricey",1
"This is a nice light top for the summer. i love how your shoulders peak out from tee, which gives it a touch of of sexiness. it does run large so i went down a size. i haven't washed it yet so don't know if it will shrink. i do recommend it though.",1
There is no possible bra to wear with this top. after one washing the neck felt funky. the pink color is very light. it's long enough for leggings. my shirt is a high hemline on one side than the other. i'll wear it but wish the neck wasn't so funky.,0
This is cute with the shoulder detail. i ordered a medium- will be returning for a small. i'm kind of in between small & medium.,1
"I put a lot of hopes on this pullover. i needed something for the spring, and it seemed perfect. plus, the sale price is very attractive compared to the regular retailer prices. but... i am not exactly disappointed, but i'd say surprised. 

i would still consider this sweater good for spring. it's thin enough to be tucked into a skirt or pants if you like. the pullover is very stretchy - frankly, i would prefer it to be less stretchy, but that might be a plus for someone more busty. the quality",0
"I'm 5' 3"", 115 pounds, and bought the xs in white. i actually wear this as a bathing suit cover-up instead of a top. i love that it's little longer in the back so it covers part of the back of my thighs. it's light weight, cool and comfortable. it is thin but has washed well with no pilling or holes so far. i've worn this several times and have had lots of compliments.",1
"I was quite excited to find this tee in the store. the design looked interesting and it seemed nice on the mannequin. the bright red color really stood out in person. i am 5'2"", 34b, tried on my usual size s and it was humongous! although the sales lady found a size xs (they don't have size xxs available in the store) for me to try on, it was still huge like a tent. it probably would fit better for a tall body figure. i would recommend those who are interested in this tee to try it in the store,",0
"This picture does not due this sweater justice, at all! i purchased this today for summer. it's beyond cute and the colors are awesome! it's a very light sweater with a fitted (but not too tight) light feel. the sleeves are a little longer than quarter length, at least on me. it looks amazing with white pants, very fresh!!",1
I wanted to love this shirt but it quickly lost shape and a hole was created in the middle of the shirt after just a few washes. not worth the price. poorly made. you need to wear a shirt underneath bc it is so thin. the shirt looks better int he picture. i like it but it wears terribly.,0
"The colors on this sweater are cute, the fabric is good quality and not too thick for spring. the fit is tts.",1
"This is really cute online, but is not fantastic on or in person. this is a top that i may be returning. i love the open shoulder, but the material is very thin, and the top runs large. it also hangs really low in the back which i am not a huge fan of.",0
"This is an oversized tee with a somewhat flattering fit. material is very thin. i ordered white, which was completely see-through. not at all what i was expecting. might work better in a darker color, but i returned it since it was nothing special.",0
"On me, this top is totally frumpy and boxy. i am 5'9, 34dd and the bottom hung on me like a bedskirt. not fitted at all. i ordered a large--not being sure of fit. i have a flat stomach and it just hung....yuck. honestly, for the price and fit, i wouldn't consider a medium. i think it would a tad better but not worth the price.",0
T la is such a great brand for t shirts! this one is so soft and comfy and the yellow color is a great neutral yellow.,1
I bought this tee in most of the colors available. that's how much i liked it. it's not tissue thin; it's a good medium weight. it does't hug the body too closely. i am 5'4 and 140 lbs with a little post partum belly and this is a really flattering tee in m.,1

"I've never bought a tee at full price, in so many colors. i love this tee.it's quite possibly the most perfect fit ever. the material is thick and hangs well without being stiff or bulky. i'm 5'2 -117lbs usually a small petite or 4p but purchased the regular small so i can wear this with skinny or regular jeans. i purchased the purple, navy and black and may go back for the yellow. the white is still a little too sheer fir me otherwise i would have purchased it. wish they had a light grey versio",1
"I'm not petite, but i am short at 5'3 and while these fit in all the right places, the leggings are about 5-6 inches too long. i'm still deciding whether to return or hem - but the hemming would have to be professionally done with this material. bummer.",1
"The sweater was nice but not as long as on the model. it was itchy also. this sweater was not what i had expected. their was nothing exceptional about it to spend that kind of hard earned cash, sorry retailer. i sent it back .",0
"I'm a petite so as usual i have to order from retailer. i saw this on line and tried it on in a regular size in the store. even though of course it didnt fit, the style of the tee was nice so i ordered it. i couldnt have been more disappointed when i received it. the quality was truly awful. i'm not even sure why it is being sold. the neckline was warped and wouldn't lie flat again the neck or chest; the bottom hem was crooked. it was really bad. also having purchased tees in similar material befo",0
"I ordered the white tee in xs and am returning it. it runs tts & had a good fit but i didn't like the material at all. maybe because it was white, but it was see through & like a tissue tee that i would expect to get little holes in it near the waist. the sleeves are gathered in the center of the sleeve & i didn't like the way that looked.",1
"I really wanted this swimsuit to work and it looks really nice in person and good quality as well, but sadly the top is cut really strangely. in the photo shown of the model, it looks like a v-neck that kinda gives your boobs a little push to the middle for some slight cleavage. however, that's not how it fit for me. the cups have removable padding on this suit, and when left in, my boobs didn't even fit in the thing and it just looked really awkward in general. and with the padding taken out, m",0
"I ordered these tees in the navy and pink thinking that it would be a slam dunk given i already bought 3 of the same tees last year. not so. this year's version is much bigger - almost 2 inches wider and about 2 inches longer. there was even a 2 inch difference between the pink and navy version so i have to assume that sizing may vary among different colors. too bad for me - but i did read a review that thought the tees were better this year. i guess we are all different. at 5'7"", 115lbs i prefe",1
"This is a very nice bra, upset though because this is the second time i have ordered something from retailer and the place that the product was made was incorrect on the website. bra was made in peru and website said usa. makes it very hard to be socially responsible on this website. not sure i will continue to shop retailer in the future because of this.",1
"As the previous reviewer mentioned, the pockets ruin this dress. pockets, usually such a good idea! but here they're misplaced (right on the hips) and made of the same thick ponte fabric as the dress, so they stand out far from the body and completely ruin the line of the dress... not flattering to have huge gaping hip pockets. this makes an otherwise good dress a total loss.",0
"I loved the fit, color and style, but the fabric seemed very thin and cheap. i was worried that it would tear easily. this is getting returned.",0
"The fabric and color of this dress is beautiful. two problems with the dress that the picture does not show. 1. it's long. i'm 5'5"". this model must be over 6 feet tall as the length hit 5 inches above my ankle and that is not a flattering length. the other issue is that there is toile underneath making the skirt extra puffy. i'm 42 and the puffiness reminded me of prom. color and fabric great. but had to send back.",0
"I was so excited to see this shirt in petite sizing. for reference, i am 5' 2"" / 105 lbs / 32a chest, with a thin but athletic build.  i love the feel of this shirt. it is made from a tencil blend that gives it a nice weight and drape. because i don't have much of a chest, i do think it is a bit low-cut on me. i will probably wear a cami underneath next time. 
it is a pretty, versatile dress up or down kind of piece, which is why i chose it. i gave it a four star rating only because it is ama s",1
"This is an amazing jacket! it fits perfectly through the shoulders, with enough give to make it comfortable. i love the color and the feel of it, as well. it will be perfect for the spring and summer evenings.",1
"Absolutely love this jacket - soft, nice amount of stretch, and the fit is beautiful. i'm 5'7"" with a long torso and was happy with the length on this too (motos are sometimes tricky for me). totally cute and versatile - worth full price!",1
"I ordered the xl in white. for fit, it's true to size. it matches the model's photos. it's a comfortable top. the shape is good with the pleating. but, the color is definitely off. it's as if the white fabric was pre-washed with navy. it's not the fresh, crisp white shown, at least for the one i received. 

the quality of the material is basic. the black version might be the better one overall. i'm going to exchange the white one i have to give that a try. overall, i don't think it's worth ful",0
Got this on a whim and boy i'm very pleased! it's flattering and the material is perfect for spring weather. size up as mentioned by other reviewers.,1
"This is a great swingy tank for summer and the smocking adds a nice design element to an otherwise plain white top. i typically wear a l, sometimes xl in tops from retailer, but the l in this is pretty loose - i am hoping it will shrink down quite a bit in the wash. otherwise i really love the top, and now that it's on sale, the price is definitely right! i wish the black one was still available!",1
"I love the design and color of this jacket. when i saw it pictured, i thought it was a vest. the sleeves and collar are made of a contrasting type of fabric; the sleeves are a knit but fit in very well with the design of the jacket.
i ordered a small because i had ordered a small in a vest made by the same manufacturer. 
this jacket runs smaller, the sleeves were very tight , and overall it was just too small. had to return it.",1
"This brand makes the best jackets. i got a vest from them last year and an olive moto jacket. both fit amazing. this one is no different. it fits great!! love that it's a great casual jacket with structure and drape. i can't say enough good things about this jacket. every time i wear it, i feel so pulled together. fun light gray color that you don't see too often in jackets. this is a jacket i see in my wardrobe for years to come. must have.",1
"I might be the only odd person out there who think this jacket is not perfect at all. a lot of other reviewers said that the jacket runs small. for me, it's not true at all, i had to go to xxp petite to find the fit acceptable, but it was simply too short (rather than 20"" as it states on the website, it's more like 18""), which is a thing i almost never experienced because i am a petite person! i don't even want to go regular size because it would've been too big. i saw some photos that others po",0
"Comments. the detail is lovely - especially the dragonflies on the sleeve. and the quality is there with the lining. trouble is this is thick fabric cut in a box shape. imo, you have to be very skinny to pull this off and not look like a tank. i looked at the model (after purchasing) and notice that she has it open and swept back a bit bc if it is not, it is terribly unflattering.",0
"I absolutely love this blouse. it is so soft, easy to wear and can be worn with so many things. i'm 5'3, 135 pounds and got a small (regular). i could've gone for the petite but decided to do regular. love it!",1
"First off this jacket is more of a greenish hue in person (which i personally love over the tan). i was not sure how the sleeves would be after a few wears since they are not canvas, but they are holding up and not stretching out. there is fleece inside the sleeves for extra warmth since it is not the best layering jacket. overall, if you're considering this jacket, take the plunge like i did. order your usual size for perfect fit or size up if you're hoping to layer.",1
"Hi, i bought this top for my daughter. she absolutely loves it. the fabric is very substantial. it flows really nice. if i was younger i would buy one for myself. lol",1
Like the color and romper style. this runs extremely large. i am normally a petite small and it was too large. with the wide- leg style and overall length you may need to alter this piece.,0
"Took a chance without trying it on and ordered online...i love everything about this sweater!!! fit is on the spot, details are pretty and wonderful! try it, you won't be disappointed.",1
I ordered this in black in a medium. i've ordered several deletta tops before and the mediums fit great but in this top i think i could have done a small. i don't want to hassle with returning it tho and it should work fine.,1
Super cute sweater and i was totally excited and then i looked at the sleeves (which are not shown in the pictures). what you can not see are the dragonfly (sequins and sparkly beads suitable for women 4 and 84). ugh. too bad - going right back.,0
"This cardigan is made of nice materials and is lined, but it is boxy and totally un-fitted. i swim, which means i have large shoulders, and this thing makes me look like a boxing champion, well a fat boxing champion as it has not waste-line. the sleeves are too long, and as usual, retailer saves on money by using little cheap hooks instead of buttons as a closing system, so if you choose to close this cardigan, it just looks awful.",0
"First let me say i love the fabric and the pattern of the blue dress. but the fit is extremely loose. they could take out an entire 12 inches of material and it would still be a swing dress. the photo of the back of the model, where the blue dress goes in to her waist is not at all accurate. if it was, i would love this dress. the photo of the model wearing the other color is how the dress actually hangs - straight down from the underarms and then bigger as it goes toward the hemline. i am 5'7""",0
"I absolutely love these sleepwear pants. they are lightweight, soft, good fit and quality and the design is really pretty!! a steal at this price.",1
"I wanted to love this dress--a throw-on-and-go outfit that was casual enough with sneakers for errands but stylish enough with dressy sandals for a brunch date--but didn't for a couple of reasons.

first, it is way too short for me, especially on the sides because of the war the ruffled bottom lay, to wear as a dress. it was more tunic length- but i wouldn't want to wear pants underneath because it would take away from the overall aesthetic. also, the ruffled sleeves give me unwanted volume th",0
Loved the idea of this but content felt too thin and sheer.,0
Loved the style and color/design but this dress was simply too short in the front. the slip was also slightly tight over hips. i wish this was longer!,1
"I bought this in the store because it was irresistible. generally i only buy sale merchandise but this item is unlikely to ever hit the sale racks. the colors are delicious - they go with everything in the grey-rose-blue pallet. the fabric is superb, heavy and glossy, good for cold weather. the size is generous in the upper body (not so much in the hips). i usually take a small or medium. there were only smalls left in the store so i couldn't try an xs. the reversible inside fabric is a complete",1
This dress is really nice and lightweight. the slip is snug so the outer part floats nicely. but..it adds a bit too much volume if you have a lot of curves. it disguises in a way but also is a bit less flattering. i really wanted to like it because it's so breezy but a tad matronly on me.,1
"I bought this after eyeing it for months, when it went on sale! the colors are bright and so pretty! the blue very warm, flattering in intensity. this pattern is very unique and the suit is well made. there is some stretch, making it not a chore to pull on.  the bust padding is minimal (like a tshirt bra) best for a & small b cups. no underwire no shaping in cups. the halter has enough room to be comfortable and secure. i felt this fit more like a 0 on the bottom (hips) and a 2 for top portion,",1
Totally see through.,0
"I love this dress (from the moment i saw it online), and now that it is on sale, i ordered it (green). i do wish the flesh color was a little more pink, love the color in person, but not as flattering on my pale skin (i ordered a different similar dress in teal and purple, that oclor was better).

so, fit: like a glove: i am dd, in waist, lbs short = 0p. length was sexy, and overall great flattering fit. similarly to other dress, i wanted the length of this one, however. nice slightly above th",1
Beautiful warm vest. originally bought small but had to exchange for extra small. i love that it reversible and has a hood.,1
"I loved this dress especially because each flower appliquã© was so beautiful. however, each attached to one another by single threads. given that i wear lots of rings, i could already tell that i might snag these beautiful flowers. additionally, the appliquã©s are sewn so close to the back zipper that some of the flowers were already getting damaged from the dress being tried on. overall, if you are very careful, this is an amazing dress, but i did return it because of its delicate nature.",0
"These pants are great. i am 5'6"" and 133lbs. i normally wear medium for athletic bottoms. medium fits well except knee pit area. maybe because they are not very stretching fabric. however, they are still flattering. the material was thick enough and their print hides underwear lines.",1

"Cute, but didnt realize it was sweatshirt material. due to that, returning.",1
I'm 4'10 and 105lbs..32c and hippy...i ordered the 00p and 0p.. bc i'm curvy the bigger size was better but the fit was just okay..couldn't justify the price. it's a beautiful dress in the green color. the zipper is difficult to get down and worries me that it would break.. but if it fit i would've overlooked it.. the major reason for returning is the slit was so high my butt cheeks were exposed if you lifted it... i would've had to have it sewn shut.,0
"After seeing this dress online i wanted to try it on and was not disappointed when i did. even though the coral color dress of the same style was pretty it wasn't the right color for me. i absolutely love the blue and white dress! i usually wear a size 8 but found the 6 was more flattering. i'm 5'2"" and the length was perfect - above the knee but not too high. love it!",1
This dress is very thick cotton material. like a sweatshirt. i was hoping to wear this to a wedding but it is a tunic at best. the bell part of the sleeves also stick out awkwardly because of the fabric.,0
"I love this dress. it is the kind of dress that i dream about. the feel is young and carefree. typically i love swing dresses on the tall thin models pictured but when i try them on i simply look frumpy. this dress is an exception. i have the lilac version and the fabric color and pattern enhance the boho pixie fairy aesthetic. for reference i am 5'4"" 122 lbs...average build a little busty 34dd. only the 6 was in stock so that is the size i ordered even though i wanted to try the 4. the 6 has en",1

This shirt is unflattering and boxy. it does not look cute at all on me. i am returning.,0
"The fit on this dress is super flattering! i am not normally able to wear a sheath but i felt great in this one. i am definitely a pear shape, bigger on the bottom than the top. one of the things i really love about this dress is that the size that fits me through the hips fits me on top. this is not often the case. i am not sure how this would work on someone with a large bust or an apple body type but i felt great in it. i also love the colors. i bought the green and blue. i have worn it once",1
I really was excited to get this dress. the design is great. very nice quality. it does seem to run small on me in the booty/belly area. that or it is just tighter than my liking. overall it is a nice dress. i plan to get a mint cardigan to top it off and a thin cognac leather belt.,1

(i am tall). the color is actually a light mint, not the grayish blue it appears in the picture. overall a great purchase though.",1
"I was so excited to receive this dress! it even has embroidered loops on the hem of the slip underneath which was such a cute detail. it's very pretty on. that being said, i ordered a size 4 which fit me perfectly (150 lbs) but ladies, i do not mean this in any way but in my personal opinion, my arms are out of shape. not toned and flabby. the sleeves on this dress will not do you any justice. it will make your arms look worse because of the shape of the sleeve. so keep that in consideration if",1

This material is a nice quality but the shirt is boxy and shapeless. it was not flattering at all on my shape. i don't think it would look nice on anyone with an hourglass shape or fuller chest.,0
I tried this dress on at my local store and was very disappointed in the slip portion of this dress. there is no give with the slip so even though the dress portion is quite flowy the slip prevents anyone with a large chest or hips to wear this dress.,0

"I actually rather like this top, i ordered a size smaller than usual, based on how flowy it looks in the picture, and was quite pleased. the pink color is rich, and i love the cut work... it has a bit of a sparkle in it, and is very pretty and flattering on the back. it does swing out a lot, but i ended up half tucking it. the pink color is very nice. it is gauze material, so of course, it is thin. i usually buy 0 but this 00 was great. also, there was no petite in the pink, so can't comment on",1
I love this shirt. i bought it in both black and white and i get compliments every time i wear it. i totally recommend this top! it's a great material and easy to wear with a lot of different bottoms.,1
The quality of this blouse is great. a bit on the thick side which i like. the fronts a bit shorter than the back. looks great with joggers or jeans. great neckline and design. i bought this in black and wore it with camo pants and sandals. love it!,1

Super simple top that's comfy. i like a looser fit and its boxy- both things i like. seems like it will be a staple piece.,1
"I was drawn to this top because of the interesting and detailed straps, which are embroidered with a lovely triangle pattern. however the embroidery takes away any stretchy-ness or give in the cotton and makes the top a beautiful but ill-fitting harness for anyone with any breasts or full-figured lusciousness. the worst part is that the top hem along the top is embroidered and rigid just like the straps, so it feels like you are wearing an uncomfortable strapless top. i wanted to keep this but h",0
"I'd recommend getting this top- but only after understanding its limitations. it's beautiful and i bought it even after reading the other critical and accurate reviews because i so loved how it paired with the skirt. unless you size down the rigid form of the embellished straps will lie funny, and the rest of the top fits bizarrely as it is both short (it could almost expose the bottom of your stomach) and has lots of fabric so it almost flows out all around you (accentuating your stomach and ma",1

Goes with absolutely everything. it's very comfortable and versatile. can be dressed up or dressed down. great thing to have in the closet when you don't know what to wear!,1
"Absolutely loved this top but after i washed it the underside color ran at the stitching. it is all white on the outside but at the bottom hem it has a really cool 1"" lining in a mustard color. i did a cold water wash and flat to dry. i noticed around the stitching at the bottom the mustard color has bled through just at the area of the mustard color stitching. 

i am so disappointed b/c i loved this top.",0

This is a great looking sweater. very nice quality and is a great design. can wear with many colors. love the look of this sweater and how it lays with the extra attachment on the bottom of it to make it kinda have a floating and airy look. nice!!!!.,1
"I love the overall look and comfort of this piece. my only negative is that since it is not lined, the folds in the material on the inside are somewhat noticeable, especially in the shoulder areas. i guess since it is a light color it is more obvious to me, but it is not something that would make me return it. it is comfortable and looks great on.",1
"From the photos, i thought the design was embroidered. in reality, it is stamped on. there is a tiny bit of embroidery and a few sequins, but overall, the design is just printed on the fabric. i didn't feel it looked good, in fact it looked kind of cheap to me, so i returned it. the overall style of the jacket was great and it would have looked equally good for work or casual. i was disappointed it didn't work out.",0

I wasn't sure if this dress would hang correctly on me and make me look shapeless but i'm so happy with it! the fabric is so comfortable and the tie in the back really helps draw it in so my waist is defined. the length is great and it's super comfortable but looks polished!,1
"These pants have substance in the material, it seems thick. i found htem to be very comfortable and love the tir waist detail. my only ""complaint' is they don't come in petites, so on my short legs, teh hem came jsut above my ankle. i think htey would look nicer with a tighter shirt than pictured on the model. did not purchase,but keeping in mind for future...",1
"I'm a fan of yumi kim dresses and consistently wear size small. so, i ordered this in a small, and the top was a little loose, but it was way too short. there's no way i would feel comfortable wearing this in public. i'm 5'7"", and the hem was higher than mid-thigh on me. the waist is also billowy and has no defined shape.",0
"This dress was so lovely in person, but when i put it on...ooh la la! it is short! i am 5' 3"" and i would not walk outside in this dress without something underneath. it just needed one more tier and i would have kept it for sure. too bad!",1
"I am 5'8"" 140 lbs and the m fits perfectly. it is flowy and feminine but the tie in the back keeps it from looking boxy. pattern is really nice. great dress!",1
I purchased these pants on 12/2/15 as a more fashionable alternative to yoga pants while traveling southeast asia starting february. after about 10-15 wears (with little washing in between as i was backpacker style traveling) the pants wore through in between my legs. the fabric first started to develop little fuzz balls everywhere and then literally disintegrated in places. i tried to sew them to continue wearing them while traveling but alas the fabric had become so thin that the thread could,0
These jeans look better in person - the pattern is more subtle than the picture online. these run true to size for ag denim.,1
"This dress is very pretty. i love it! people are not kidding about the buttons! i was prepared to reinforce them after it arrived. unfortunately, both buttons at the wrists were missing and they were not in the bag. it was on sale so i'm guessing they were lost before shipping. i love the dress enough to keep it. it will not be that big of a deal to replace them. besides the buttons, the dress is a very nice quality. it is lined and has a nice weight to it. i'm obsessed with rifle paper co. so i",1
"I'm 5'2 & the length is fine except i'd probably hem if i used for yoga/pilates. but i prefer cropped for those activities, so these are just knock a round lounge pants for me. they are thin, but not in a cheap way. i don't understand why they're called french terry became that's not what i see/feel; but they are sumptuous & soft. i like that the fold over waist part is stitched & keeps its shape. for size reference, , i got the black xxs- i'm 115 lbs, athletic apple & they fit/look great & clin",1
Top is completely see through. i cant imagine if it were to get wet what it would look like. it is a cute design but not practical at all.,0
"I agree with the other two reviews that this shirt runs large, or something? ! i ordered an xs, my usual size, xs-s. the body of the shirt is very loose, the upper arms are a bit snug, and i don't have large arms. the shoulder seams are in a very strange place, but when you look at the model, it doesn't look so bad. with the shirt i received, and another reviewer, the seam was puffy, making for a strange look. in theory, the shirt should have worked, but didn't. i loved the pattern, not the fit.",0
I had high hopes for this cute top but it runs very short. it is not as long as it appears on the model so it looked odd when i put it on. unfortunately it had to go back. bummer cuz it was very cute in the pix!,0
"I loved the look of this sweater on-line, but it just didn't work for me. the fit wasn't good enough. the style okay. the color fine. the feel, scratchy. overall, it did not work for my body.",0
"I really wanted to love this shirt. the snowflake and stripe design is really cute, and the fabric is of nice quality. it's a very loose fit, which i would've been willing to work with, but... as mentioned in previous reviews, the shoulder seam rests in an odd place on your upper arm, and there are little bumps in the fabric on the arms that appear similar to what happens if you leave a shirt on a wire hanger too long. it looks like you have nubby little wings coming out of your arms. not attrac",0
"I am 5'8"" and 130 lbs and bought a size s. it fits, but is not as roomy as it appears in the model and the sleeves are not as long. the collar fits strangely on me. the deal breaker was that the sweater is not soft, but is itchy and kind of coarse. i am returning this one.",0
"I pretty much love any sweater by moth. this one is no exception. soft, lofty, and a pretty shade (i bought in pink), this will be a cold weather staple.",1
"Agree with above review. these are described totally wrong. they are not 8.5 rise. they are very high rise, so much that i didnt even try them on...the color isnt good either, it looks like a cheap levi's color or just not a quality denim. if you like high rise, you might like them. i can't comment on fit..",0
I made the mistake of ordering without checking the reviews. cute design but not as comfy as it looks. returned immediately.,0
This top runs huge. not only in the torso/chest area but the sleeves on this were enormous and the shoulder area was very puffy. i am normally between a m-l but would have to get a small or extra small to make it work.,0
This dress is so flattering and just beautiful in person. love it!,1
I'm an employee and bought this top today. i'm so happy i ended up buying it on a whim! it's adorable and super comfy! it's perfect for those jeans and a tee day! i can't wait to wear it to work. the color is gorgeous and the peplum adds a feminine detail without being too puffy...in love!,1
It was ok. very swingy and lots of fabric at the bottom. the pocket seemed to not sit in the right spot like it was too far over and i wanted to keep adjusting the position of the shirt. i might buy it on sale but i sent it back bc it's definitely not worth $60.,0
Bought in white. it has a ribbed detail that makes ir only for casual wear.  the white is pretty sheer. will return.,0
"I love the style and the look of this sweater. i wanted to love it and keep it but could not because the itchiness was too much. the style looks so comfortable and easy going, but it was not, it was clingy around the waist and backside. for reference, i am 5ft 4in and 128b and i ordered the small - the sleeves were too long on me, not ""cool"" long like some other sweaters this season.",0
"This sweater has potential, but it wasn't right for me. the collar isn't flattering on me...too thick, and my shoulders are already broad. my waist is high, so i need a longer look. the color is true to size, but it's s little see through...dark bra shows through.",0
"I should have paid more attention to the reviews of this sweater before ordering. although the material looks soft and cozy in the photo, it's very scratchy and uncomfortable. i was also hoping the opening of the collar would be a little wider, which would have been more flattering on me. i never wear turtlenecks of any kind so i took a chance on this. i'm sure others will look fabulous in this sweater and may be happy with it if they don't mind the texture. i'm sending it back.",0
"I purchased this on sale, xxs petite and i'm glad i did. it's an adorable sweater, but i knew the moment i put it on - itch city! bummer. i wore it with a tank underneath and that helped. it's a very warm sweater and the style is really cute. looks really soft and cozy, but i would say itchy and cozy!",1
This dress is a lot of fun and would be great for a party or a wedding but unfortunately it didn't fit me right. i ordered a small since i usually wear a size 2 but the waist was just a little bit loose while the dress was too tight across the bust. this caused the dress to pull up in the front and make it look too high in the waist. i guess i'm just too busty for this dress. too bad because i really wanted it to work. it is a lovely dress.,1
"Soft, comfy and cute! great for casual wear! should've bought in more colors",1
"Such quality went in to this dress - it is beautiful. the torso is lined and the tulle is not super poofy at the waist. it is, however, not made for the busty gal. i am a 32 dd, the fabric comes in at the arm pits making for narrow coverage around the chest. also this dress is short waisted, it is almost an empire on me. i wish it worked, as it is lovely. perhaps it will work on the someone super thin? so sad about it!",1
"I don't even know where to begin--this is a dress for all seasons, but especially the holiday season! i bought it specifically for the guise of a holiday part, i can't tell you what a (black) velvet blazer and (black) patent leather heels did for it! the amazing part is that i wore it to work with a cardigan and booties with no problem. my coworkers were amazed but its transition. i have a slim velvet belt with a antique-ish looking clasp that i wore all day with it, too, and that was the cherry",1
"The review above titled ""so disappointed"" couldn't have said it any better. the dresses from last year are perfect. i probably wear them at least once a week. i was so excited to see this vibrant blue color and fully expected the same quality as last year. i'm generally an xs or s in dresses (however i have xxs from last year's version), and the xs in this one is lifeless. it's heavy, hot, doesn't have the same nice shape as last year. i may cut out the integrated lining just to lighten the dres",0
"I thought this tank would be so cute and comfy for my daily walks, but it's completely see through.  i sized down one size based on a review from another website and it fits ok, but it's hard to say if it runs tts because i have nothing to compare it to.  if the fabric was a little thicker, this would be the perfect tank.  unless your planning on layering this, i wouldn't recommend.",0
"Is a great top for layering over leggings, running errands or after the gym. the material was thin. i returned it because the color didn't look great on me and for the price, i just didn't love it.",1
Was so excited to get this dress because i thought it was cute and i love flowy and big dresses - however this looks huge. the material is not soft so it doesn't fall well. it just stays proofed out so from the back you look like a giant!!,0
"I was a huge fan of these lovely swing dresses from last year and bought all 3 colors. when i saw this new one, i was thrilled and ordered it immediately. what a disappointment! why did isabella sinclair mess with a good thing? the fabric is a very loose weave sort of ""homespun"" look, which wouldn't be a deal breaker, but i could see it would be very vulnerable to snags. last year's styles had a removable light knit full slip that allowed the airy fabrics to move. this version is fully lined. yo",0
"It's a nice casual dress that you can also dress up, but unfortunately it is going back. i got a small since dolan dresses always run large, but i usually get a petite. i should've known this wouldn't work. i wanted to love it because the top looks great, but the length is too long making the waist fall lower than i would like giving my middle a thick appearance.i'm thin, but i'm not skinny, 5'3"" with an athletic build and a short torso with a decent size bust...if that helps. usually i can wear",1
I really wanted this to work. the style and colors are great and it is comfortable too. i didn't like how big the skirt portion was or how stiff the fabric was. it looked like a plaid tent on me but not in a terrible way. it could work on the right body.,1
"This dress is huge. i am normally a l-xl regular in retailer brands. i love a loose, flowy dress. after trying one on in the store (just a random returned petite xl) i ordered the petite medium. and it was still huge and not flattering. so sad. i wanted to love this- loved the material and colors, but way off.",0
The yellow is not as bright as the pic and the tee shirt base color is more off white/oatmeal making the shirt look much more drab in person than in the pics. fit was ok but nothing special about this and will be returning.,0
"Very pretty. runs true to size. waist is higher than in the photo, as other reviewers have stated. correct fit is important because the arm openings are a little big, i thought, and when i sized up to try to get the waist a little lower, the arms were too large.",1
"Got this 4 days ago and have worn it 3 of those days. it is a perfect, beautiful autumn dress. the fabric is textured and slightly color-varied in a way that gives the black a more charcoal depth. the fabric is a thin sweater knit -- because of the texture it looks thicker than it is and i had hoped it would be thicker but i actually think if it were thicker it would not have the movement it does, nor would it be as figure-flattering. despite its thinness, it is still warm. would buy this in oth",1
Love this blazer. you can wear it with anything. fits well and lightweight. perfect for south florida.,1
The issues the other reviewers mentioned didn't bother me as i don't have the prior years version to compare. i love the color and feel of the fabric.  a little heavier and great for early fall layering. the armholes weren't big for me but i got a small and would normally be a medium. the cut works great for a very curvy petite frame. it doesn't add bulk but does flatter a larger chest. i can see why this doesn't work for taller ladies as the pockets and hip do flare with the heavier fabric but,1
I loved the color of this shirt but it does run big. i even sized down and it was still large on me and the ruffles flare out a bit which was not flattering one me. it looks pretty on the hangar.,0
I ordered this in blue and the color is absolutely gorgeous! i really loved it until i put it on. wow it was bad. i ordered a small--normally a sm/med due to bust but this was so wide and had so much material. it wasn't long but rather incredibly boxy. one of the most unflattering things i've ever tried at retailer.,0
"I really fell in love with this shirt. i am about 5 4 and 110 pounds. i ordered xxs which that was a good size from the chest but this shirt is literally so wide, i was ready to fly. although the model wears this shirt really nicely, i think this shirt is made for a certain type of body. not quite sure what that is.... also this shirt is shorter than what i expected. it looks a lot longer on the model. i had to return this shirt.",0
"This skirt was cute on, but not particularly flattering. i thought the denim was a little too stiff. typically, a-lines are flattering on my figure, but this was a miss.",1
I am pleased with this skirt. the jean material is of good quality and it hangs right on my waist and hips. i ordered a 2 which left a little room in the waist to tuck in a blouse. i am 5/5 and 119. it works well for work and leisure.,1
"Really was excited to get what i thought would be a very versatile piece. unfortunately because i have ample hips, the skirt just made me look very wide overall. in addition, i am short at 5'2 so the length was also not flattering plus it is high waisted - it was just a lot of denim on me that made me look too wide and even shorter.",0
Great denim color and fit. gives a nice feel to the waist.,1
"I love this tee but it isn't for everyone. i am usually a solid medium & i tried on both xs/s. i went w the small bc i liked the volume.  for reference, i'm 5'6"" and wear a medium/size 8-10. 

not thinking this is for small petite women as the peplum hem is poplin, not tee knit material so it holds its shape. on my frame it was so cute. got the holly color.",1
"I had such high hopes for this top! the colors! the peplum! the ruffles! the price point! the fit was terrible, unflattering, and laughable! please try again with this one, retailer. you could have a real winner with a little tweaking!",0
C'mon. the accent is wrong! a simple google search would prevent this.,0
It fits super baggy everywhere and looked sloppy on me.,0
This brand generally runs small but really this skirt is exceptionally small in the waist. i usually take an 8/10 in retailer bottoms and i had to go up to a 12! i love the details and uniqueness of the skirt. i like the shape and very much my style in a skirt. fabric is soft . i waited for sale plus promo and it was then worth the purchase. it reminds me of an old school retailer style .,1
"The skirt is beautiful, but the sizing is kind of off. i usually wear a 6, at 5'6"" and 130 lbs. i ordered an 8, though, since sometimes athropologie clothes run small. even the 8 was too tight, so i'll have to exchange it.",1
"I noticed this top on one of the sales associates, and it looked great. she's probably 230lbs and about 5'5.  tried it on and it looked horrible, i even tried sizing down twice. i'm 5'8"" and the ruffles started right under my chest. i gave 2 stars bc of the material, it is light, and summery.",0
"I ordered the skirt online and when it arrived i loved the fit and the aesthetic of the skirt. i usually wear a 0/2 bottoms and sized up based on comments- it fits great could maybe even have taken a 6 to have a looser fit.

i was however very disappointed when receiving the skirt to see that the material was already highly snagged- how is that possible if coming directly from the warehouse? i'm hesitating to return because i consider it already damaged based on the current condition and if it's",0
"I had my eye on this skirt online but it sold it out in my size 2 so i ordered a 0 and crossed my fingers. before it arrived, i happened across a size 2 at my retailer store that someone had returned. it fit perfectly. i am 5'6"" and my waist is 25/26. it is high waisted but i thought that added to the fit and made it stand out from the usual black skirt. it fit my waist and hips./butt fine. it is quality material and has a structured fit and great length. it is unique and classic. i can see this b",1
"This dress is really pretty, but the fit is off. it is not fitted at the waist which made the back look poofy. also, the arm length is not flattering; it needs to be either longer or shorter. additionally, if one was to wear it a lot, the felting might start to fray.",0
"I love the fabric of this shirt -- it's super soft. however the fit is off -- i'm normally a medium and the buttons across the chest were gaping open when buttoned (never a problem for me, i'm a 34b and not very busty). it is also a bit on the short side, especially when the general trend is toward longer shirts/tunics. i would recommend sizing up (in fact i'm going to try this in a large, fingers crossed...)",1
"I was hesitant to buy this dress due to there not being any reviews, but decided to take a chance and order it. it is fabulous!!! great fit, off the shoulder design stays in place, and the dress hits the smallest part of my waist perfectly. the lace detail on the hem and the tassels on the ties are details that sets this dress apart. i wish that it was made in another color, perhaps a solid. you all hit this one out of the park, retailer!!!",1
I love this blouse with a pair of jeans. the neckline is fairly deep but very flattering and feminine. the detail is beautiful.,1
"I purchased these in a 26 petite and a 26 regular. the 26r was too long and bunched up terribly pass the knee. they were also loose in the waist and overall body. the 26p fit great in the waist and body, however; past the knee it was too tight and again it bunched but not as bad as the 26 reg. the overall quality of the jean seems fairly good. the fit just did not work for me so these go back and the hunt continues for white jeans. would love it if they made the hyphen jeans in white.",0
"I love this skirt, wanted to order it from the moment it was new and took em a while to decide to do so (when i saw it was almost sold out in my size, which it is now). another thing is it doesn't come in petite - boohoo.
anyway, ordered the 0 (smallest size) for my 26.5 in waist - didn't have any trouble with the waist being too tight, like some other reviewers. it fit really well and comfortably. sits at the natural waist, so the hem isn't too crazy low on me. fine for heels (would be so cute",1
It fits great! i love the material and how it fits and drapes.,1
This shirt runs gigantic and it's not even cute. i.'m done buying retailer online.,0
"I love the feel of this shirt. from a distance it looks like flannel but close up it appears more like muslin. i find the fabric very soft and the colors are fab--more vivid than the photo. the buttons do not go all the way up the shirt. for me the top button is right at the top of my cleavage so i can wear it alone or with a cami or other scoop neck. if you want a more refined flannel look/feel, this is it. i find it tts. if you're in between sizes, i would order down.",1
"Wonderful pencil skirt with subtle design to pair with a variety of tops or sweaters. fabric is nice and has a true 'fitted' design. however, the sizing is all off. it runs small and too long. i'm 5'3 and wait 25/26 in denim and a 2-4p in most skirts. the 4 is too tight and past the knee in length. more like upper calf. the 6 would be way too long. disappointed.",0
I own many blouses by tiny. the arms on this blouse billow out which was not flattering or thinning on me. the shirt was just blah.,0
"I really wanted to love these because i love my other steps, but they did not feel or fit the same way at all. i was also disappointed to see that they are cream and not white. these jeans feel stiffer than other stets i own and the waist was huge on me. sadly, these will be going back.",0
"This dress is so beautiful in person. it is not overly flowy, well made and extremely feminine. i really have not a bad word to say about it. and on sale, it's a steal. i plan to wear mine with tall boots as shown and with my cowboy boots.",1
"Ugh, the fit of this dress is terrible :/ what a beautiful dress though -- the material and the colors -- had so much potential. but, the fit is awful -- i ordered by regular size and the top was more or less ok, if not a tad big, but hip down was crazy tight that i couldn't even zip it without a ton of effort. i don't think sizing up will help because then the top will be even bigger. disappointing.",0
I own 4-5 other cloth and stone tops and always love the softness of the material. this one missed the mark. not soft and very thick. not what i was expecting.,0
"I love the design of this blouse and the pattern, but the colors are a bit darker than in the photo. the quality is pretty poor. i feel like its a snag away from being ruined and thrown away and for this price it is just not worth the purchase. sending it back :( 
it comes with a tank top; just to let others know.",0
"I am glad to add this very versitile top to my wardrobe. it can be worn with a sweater in the cooler months (like i wore it today), a business jacket, or alone in the summer. i wore it with a fit-and-flare skirt today, but it goes with pants, jeans, shorts, etc.
fyi: i am a 36 c(34d), short waist, broad shoulders/back, size m in knit tops, 10/12 in fitted or ones with buttons. i purchased my normal size m in this top.
i have no real waist, so the shape of the top really does help to make one for",1
"I loved the design of this blouse and ordered it the first day it was available. unfortunately, i was disappointed on arrival. besides being more muted color-wise, the sizing is way off. i ordered the xxsp and it was huge on me. on the model, it looks like it skims the body, when in reality, it falls like a tent. i tried tucking it into a skirt, but there was just too much fabric.

though the neck worked for me, i can see how it might be too small for some people as it is very narrow. also, it",0
"Great fit, the fabric is supple and of good quality; has a fasionable look to it but is also very very comfortable. can't beat that!",1
"Online, i like the design, the leaves stand out. in-person, the leaves don't stand out as much, you can barely see them they are so light. the top is slightly see-through. the price is high. i think this top would work better on a more slender frame. i like the top but the price is too high for the quality and thin fabric. it may look better on a slender frame, i think. it was just too light and thin for me.",0
"I'm not sure what it is with ag. i own at least a dozen pairs of their jeans, in blue, black and white denim. i wish i could say they're all great, but unfortunately there's a big variation in how they wash, depending on the fabric content. i just purchased these because i love the lighter wash for spring, but after washing them once i can see they won't be a favorite pair. even with cold water and hanging them to dry, the fabric bunches weirdly and the shape of the leg changes. at this price po",0
"I thought this was such a beautiful cardigan from the online photos. i ordered it in the small size but the fit is strange. the arms and wrist cuffs are so large it cannot be pushed up to stay out of the way for things i would like to do when wearing it (i'm a teacher and my classroom is that kind of environment). i was also confused by the front ""collar"" ribbing and how it was supposed to lay - open, folded over, partly folded over - it just didn't seem to have a particular style to this area.",0
"Absolutely love this dress. it is perfect for the summer. yes it wrinkles but that does not take away from how cute the dress is. the style is so unique, love the pleats. i am 146lbs, 5'6"" 36dd and the size 8 fits perfectly. not tight through the arms holes or the bust area. the dress hangs perfectly, you can dress it up or where it to run errands.",1
"I stalked this when it went out of stock for a few weeks and was so excited when it came back in stock. but when it arrived, it just didn't look as good. it's very oversized. and it's itchy and kind of synthetic-looking. i felt like it added bulk when i tried it on. the collar also didn't fold gently like it does in the pictures. returned it!",0
Nice and colorful dress but runs very oversized. material mutes the colors not as vibrant in person.,0
I ordered  flora nikrooz for my daughter for her wedding.  it is beautiful. the delivery was quick!!! very happy.,1
"This is a pretty dress. i bought a size 0 and the body of the dress fit, however, the sleeves were too long. had to return, as the loose and longer sleeves made the dress look too big on me.",0
"I wanted to love this top but couldn't. i am curvy (36/27/39; 32dd) and this accentuated my hips (which is not needed) and made my chest/whole shape seem boxy. i could only recommend this top to someone who is smaller chested with a straight build- the bottom would help give some shape; pleating on front would help chest seem larger. i did love the color and construction, lace details, 3/4 sleeves.",1
"I was so excited to buy this coat, since i missed out on buying the last one. i snagged it quickly before heading out on a trip because this is the perfect plane jacket (i've borrowed my friends). i immediately noticed that the fabric was lighter and softer than the original, and after a few days noticed a lot of pilling on the coat, and a snag on the seam of the shoulder where the arm connects to the body. it's disappointing considering the price you pay. i would return if it still had tags on.",0

"I am 5 8"", 130 and i usually wear a 4 in tops like this from retailer but the fit of this one was not good for me. though the styling and details of the top are lovely, it was small through the shoulders and very large everywhere else. looked too much like maternity. i love the shape of this kind of top but to be flattering it actually needs to be fitted through the bust and upper body and then flare in the right places and this was pretty boxy all around. too bad - so cute!",0
"This sweater coat is perfect. i've been looking for one i loved for years. in my opinion, it runs true to size. i ordered my usual xsp. it is fitted in the arms and loose on the body. i love it.",1
This top is a lovely combination of rugged and refined and will be versatile wear for a party pared with nice pants and flats to casual with jeans and boots. it appears well made though i had to size up for my broad shoulders but other hh tops fit the same way.,1
"I ordered this dress to wear for a rehearsal dinner. i almost consistently wear a medium in most clothing but for this picked the large because of my height. i was for sure it would be too short in any other size. when i put it on i was drowning in it! i would definitely order the small if i had the time before the rehearsal. has the potential to be super cute and flattering, yet the timing and sizing didn't work out. definitely give this one a try!",1
"I never owned an 'older' version, so nothing to compare to.  i found it comfortable, stylish and warm on a cool fall day. the minor piling made it look more rustic, has not shed on any of my other clothes so far...",1

"Here's the thing: i ride horses. you would think this would mean i would love this, but the first time it came around, i hesitated simply because i spent too much of my childhood in horse-bedecked things looked overwhelmingly nerdy. but this time, having actually purchased the belted navy birds version, i had to give it a try, and it's kind of a must. there is just something about the way it falls that is super flattering. it's just warm enough to serve as a jacket right now (in new england) but",1
"This is every bit as lovely as shown! the shade of blue is delightful with the pintucks, lace embellishment's and covered buttons. for me, tts. i bought the size 4 (34-b) my normal size. i can see where it could be a problem for bustier women because the pin tucks tightened the upper chest area and it is fitted in the shoulder area. going up a size may help some but if your smaller like me it is tts. i think it's a wonderful rendition of a denim top. this would work in any season of the year.",1
"This jacket is so cute and fits perfect and i love the motif. however, it deposited black linty particle all over my pants and top and the fabric was already pilling just from being on the hanger in the store. this piece will look bad/worn/old in a very short period of time. it's a big shame, because it's so perfect in every other way. i choose not to buy it. it's very expensive for the quality.",0
"This top is so pretty but runs small. i have a 34 dd chest and small back and shoulders . the size 10 was too full cut on the bottom and the 8 was better on the bottom but fit the same on top, felt like the seams under the arms with either size would rip. truly an odd fit and cut. this brand tends to run small and narrow. better for a smaller chest .",0
"I saw this in the store and wanted to try it but couldn't justify buying *another* denim shirt at this price. then it went on sale! as others said, this does run a bit small though the chest/shoulders, so i sized up one size. it's still slightly fitted, but my broad shoulders are used to that. i was afraid that the pleats would give a maternity look (although my chest size is not that large 36b)-- it doesn't do that on me. it's loose but not overly so--kinda like the current swing top trend! the",1
"This top is very nice. good quality, good design. it just doesn't fit me well. i have a large chest and this is a tad fitted at the top, especially around my shoulders, while the lower half fits due to the pleats. the fit seems inconsistent at the top and bottom. i am full-figured, perhaps it would fit a leaner person better.",0
"This dress fits perfect! the material is so soft and hangs so flattering. long enough to cover the booty, but short enough to show off my legs. and the color is beautiful (i got the wine color).",1
For those who are wondering this sweater coat is 50% lambswool and 50% acrylic. the original version of this coat was 100% lambswool. 50% acrylic yet the price remained the same???i would have payed more money to have this sweater coat made in 100% lambswool like the original version. this is another example of declining quality and a high price tag for synthetic materials.,0
"I read the existing reviews, before purchasing, and a few mentioned that this sweater ran large. this has been my experience with most tops i have purchased from retailer. i figured by ordering a medium, i would receive a slightly loose to moderately loose fitting sweater. this was not the case! the sweater is short, does not look anything like it does when you view the model from behind (and i assume the model is taller than i...as models are usually tall). for reference, i am 5'6'', medium build",0
The buttons on the side give this top style. great color and fabric make it perfect paired with denim.,1
"These jeans were not for me. they are very straight...hence the name 'parallel'. i'm have more of a straight athletic build so for me it was too much straight and didn't flatter my shape at all.

however, very nice jean once again from pilcro.",1
"I ordered this top in the grey along with the white lace up back pocket tee. while the other tee was totally see through and very poor quality, this one delivers in every way. in fact, i am sending the other one back to get this top in the ivory as well. the lace is very substantial and the fabric is not see through at all, like so many tops are these days. i ordered my usual medium and it comes down over my bum, just like i wanted to wear with leggings. i see this as a staple and this is my fir",1
"I love this top! it is a perfect summer staple but for me it was too short. i sized up to fix this problem because i prefer the boho, flowy look. it is flowy on it's own but i felt it lacked length so went up a size. waiting for my retailer mail with anticipation!",1
These are some of the few pants that are semi loose with a wide waist band that make me look thinner! i love them. they are soft! they match everything. they make an outfit effortlessly chic. i took a size m and it fit tts.,1
I love this top. the design is flattering and the fabric drapes nicely. the length is perfect and can dress it up and down.,1
"I love these tanks. the straps are wide enough to hide my bra straps. they're soft. and long enough to give me added length to shirts that run short. because this tank runs small and i had to size up to get the fit that i like, the straps are a little long, but after i alter them with a little sewing, they're perfect. i've had to do this with retailer tanks in the past, and it's worth it to me for the quality that i'm getting. the regular price is too high, so i only buy them on sale. i try",1
"Adore these jeans! great length, cute cuffed details. could do cartwheels in these :)",1
"I loved the way this top looked in stock photos. the colors are bright and cheery and it's a great transition piece. but the way the sleeves are cut almost makes them feel like water wings (if that makes sense)? they are stiff and wide and awkward. i've worn this a few times, hoping maybe the sleeves would relax down. they haven't. maybe it will look okay under a blazer for the office or something.",0
"I wanted to love this. it is so cute and the xxsp, my usual size, fit perfectly. however there was a fatal flaw in the construction. the hem was not sewn properly - very asymmetrical and lopsided. instead of a scoop like shown on the model, it was much longer on one side than the other. i thought maybe it was just how it hung on me, but i took it off and laid it on my bed and i could clearly see that it was sewn wrong. this is going back. i ordered another one (now it's on backorder), hopefully",0
This had a cute design but an unflattering fit for me.  it was boxy and made my boobs look droopy.,0
"This tee is cute, keep in mind the white is totally sheer. but it's huge. i ordered an xxs and it's very loose and drapey, which is likely the style but when did sizing get to unrealistic? also, a totally sheer, basically a sort of fancier cotton tee for $60? no way.",0
"This is a great little top. a wonderful basic, but the crochet/lace detail adds the perfect amount of uniqueness. it's a soft jersey material that doesn't cling. falls very nicely over the body, flow-y without being too flow-y. i ordered my usual small, and it fits tts. for reference i'm 5'1, 125 lbs, and 34d bust. i did not order the petite since i have a longer torso, very happy i orderer a regular small. will be a great spring and summer top.",1
"I thought this was adorable on the model, but not so much on me. i actually didn't mind it when i tried it on with a long cardigan, but i didn't want to keep it for 1 look. the material felt inexpensive. the shape was very unflattering for an average sized women like myself. i'm 5'8"" and about 160 lbs.",0
"I bought this shirt yesterday for 30% off the sale price. i usually wear a m. the store only had s and i didn't want to pay for shipping, so i bought the smaller size. it was loose through the body, tight in the arms. you could size down if you need to. but if you have large arms, i would get your normal size or get one larger. the arm fabric does not have much give. the shirt dips low in the front and back, so it has ample coverage for your mid section. it also would accommodate just about any",1
"Got this in the white and it fits perfectly. just the right length and enough detail on the shoulders. i'm 5'6"" and 120 (usually an xxs or xs for tops) and the xs fits just right, not too loose not too tight. i like the style since it emphasizes my shoulders and balances nicely with cropped jeans (i'm pear shaped). material is slightly clingy but it adds to the drape nicely (wouldn't work well if it was fitted, but it's not).",1
"I was so excited to get this in the mail, and so disappointed when i put it on. it had a nice feel to it and fit well when i zipped it up, but i don't really know how to adequately describe what it looked like when i glanced in the mirror - lumpiness along the seams? i don't know if it was a manufacturing flaw or not, but it gave me lumpy-looking hips and then kind of clung around my mid-thigh area. returned it the next day.",0
On my screen this looked like burnt oranges were mixed with pink but this was all pink & very washed put pinks - looked awful on me as brunette. maybe will work for someone who likes pastels. overall style was also disappointing- just hung. this went back.,0
"This blazer looks great on the model and i have a long torso so i thought it would be perfect. when i got it it looked like a big box and didn't fit anywhere. the shoulder pads were giant and the bottom of the coat was huge. i got a small based on other reviews, but it was way too big. sadly, i had to return it.",0
"Such a cute plaid print, i couldn't resist ordering this but all of the petite sizes were sold out. i went with the xs based on other reviews and it was just too huge. i ended up returning it. i think the xs petite may have worked but it's sold out so i'll never know. it is boxy so you may need to be careful if that fit works for your body or not. the colors are magnificent.",0
"Looks great on the picture but when it arrived it was a great disappointment, both the colors and style. the material seems great quality but it's stiff and scratchy, the style is very boxy, and as another reviewer said, just hung. i'm a brunette and the colors looked terrible on me. back it goes.",0
Tried this on in the store and fell in love. it's such a simple shirt but the details are special. runs tts. will get a lot of use out of this.,1
"I tried on these jeans in the store because they were so soft, but had to order my size. when they arrived, the wash on the jeans was worn enough that they looked a little dirty. i prefer to have a dressier jean in a dark wash so i am returning them. my normal pilcro pant size is 27 and these were a little large in the waist. not sure if they would shrink with washing.",1
"I?m mad for plaid but usually for smaller pattern and winter colors. somehow, this top was love at first sight. it looks simple but it?s not. it?s unique in its own way (look at the back, the slightly puffy sleeves, the side slit), and the colors are such a great mix that go with everything. the stylist opened up a couple of side buttons and tied the material to a knot, so cute. i purchased the xs and the fit is the same as shown online (i?m 5?2?, 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). i know the price seems",1
Can't pants. the material is lightweight and perfect for summer. however i felt they were cut narrow in the hips. i am a solid size 30/8 and i couldn't get the 30 over my hips.,1
"This pretty tee looks wonderful on! the cut and drape really flatter a woman's shape and will be versatile for pairing with casual or work outfits. i love the soft feeling, although it is not cotton as posted online.; the tag inside the shirt says: 95% rayon, 5% spandex. it doesn't really matter, but it's not what i expected. the rayon/spandex is very soft to the touch, has a beautiful texture to it and certainly feels comfortable. i really love the lower back hem at the hips, so flattering! i d",1
"The fabric is thin, though. you better wash it in a bag or the washing machine will tear it up!",1
I looked forward to this dress.  it's a lovely design.  it's a heavy material that doesn't have the most flattering fit.  the green lace has snags along the hemlines which is a disappointment.  i'm returning the dress.,0
"I've been looking for a leather/faux leather jacket for ages, and this one is perfect! it's just a tiny bit edgy, but more feminine than most leather jackets, which is exactly what i was looking for. i typically wear xs, but after reading the reviews for this jacket that said it runs small, i ordered both a small and xs to try on. the small was way too big, and the xs fit perfectly - it can be worn over a light layer or over a chunky sweater very comfortably, without the arms getting tight. i th",1
"I love how these jeans look on. tts, adorable. i exchanged my first pair due to stitching coming out in the back right pocket. pair #2 -the stitching came out in the exact same place. this seems to be a problem with the quality/sewing. the fact that the stitching is gold and decorative as well as functional means it will keep unraveling until the jeans are ruined. 2nd pair has to go back. too bad.",0
"This is a stunning dress. fits true to size, very high quality, has a very flattering shape, and the lace embroidery is gorgeous.",1
"I am 5'4, 34b, 106lbs and the 0 fit me perfectly. it comes just above my knee so i could also have worn the petite and would have been fine if it was shorter too. i rarely wear green but this shade is so pretty.",1
"I love this dress! i am 5'3"" 117 lbs and ordered the size 0. the fit is excellent and is very flattering. the color is more kelly green than what is shown in the picture, and is lovely. i wore it to my 40th celebration and adored wearing the dress!",1
I'm very disappointed in the quality. it seems more like a pajama than a tunic. definitely not worth 100.00 dollars. i plan to return it.,0
The material that was used to make this top is very thin and poor quality. it feels like the type of material that will disintegrate after one wash. i normally wear an xl and this top is huge and not flattering. returning asap.,0
"I ordered a small, which is my usual retailer size, but this was like a tent on me. it's fine if you like things super super blousey but that wasn't what i was looking for. also it is very long, a very weird amount of long. also there is only eyelet on the front. the whole back of the shirt is just plain fabric. i like the idea of this shirt but all in all it was very disappointing.",0
This top runs 2 full sizes large. had to send back and didn?t want to bother with getting a new one.,0
I really like the soft and very wearability of this vegan leather jacket. my only wish was for the jacket color to have a bit more rose tone to it as the color description implies. overall a definite keeper!,1
"I have many moulinette soeurs creations. all are true to my size, breathtakingly beautiful, unique, made well. i ordered this dress, and i am very excited about receiving it soon. the front neckline is round, and it becomes a v in the back.",1
"I have an hourglass shape and this dress is a good fit. i think this dress looks better in person than it does in pictures. however, i'm concerned about washing it with that stark fabric and color change.",1
If you look closely at the pictures this dress is shown 2 different ways. one with a lace covered v-neck and one with a rounded neck. which is it retailer? don't know about the size but i had to answer the question. i won't order the dress until i know exactly which style i'm ordering.,1
"The catalog shot and model shot are completely different. it's like not even the same dress. the neckline, color, the quality of lace",0
I really liked the style and fit of this shirt but i'm giving it a 2 because i shirt should last longer than 6 months. i've taken it to the cleaners 2 times and the fabric behind the tag beneath the collar has fallen apart and there are holes.,0
"I have no where to wear this pretty spring time inspired dress.  fits just as pictured, except that i'm short.  i ordered the 10p so my 36dd chest and wide rib cage fit comfortably.  i'm saving this dress for easter or a fancy bridal shower.",1
"I love this jacket. i have not worn it yet, as the weather is still very warm, but i am looking forward to wearing this a lot this fall. the cropped cut is very flattering and the vegan leather very soft, i followed the other reviews and ordered one size up and it;s perfect. i am normally a size 4 and went with he medium. the plum color is quite neutral in person. i also love the printed lining. i did notice quite a few long threads around the lining sewing, i hope this is just an overlooked pos",1
"I originally ordered the white in this cami, but after receiving was absolutely obsessed with it! i ordered the 2 other colors. the fabric is so soft and the buttons are perfect as i just had a baby and will need easy access for nursing. love this cami!",1
"Very comfortable top, exactly what i was looking for on the hotter summer days. the white is a bit sheer, but a nude strapless worked just fine for me. i also bought the pink and it is a very pale, soft pink. the material is super soft like typical cloth & stone products.",1
"Detailed beading was beautiful. it's too boxy, way to much fabric in the waist/bust and tight on the hips. it doesn't fall boxy/boyfriend like. the grey fabric is not soft and is lighter in color than the picture. was hoping this would be my go to sweater for warmth on casual days-bummed.",0
"Thought this would be my goto fall ""dressy sweathsirt."" it ran smaller than expected and it just didn't have the drapey sweatshirt shape that i prefer. the detailing on the arms and waistband is to die for though.....",0
"Very pretty, romantic",0
I recently purchased this blouse on their 40% off sale in white. i was hoping for a crisp white structured blouse. i did read all the reviews and thought i would give it a try anyway. it is awful. there is no structure or shape but the quality is the reason i am returning. it feels like a napkin or thinner. not even worth the extra sale price. i will be returning.,0
"Very cute plaid button down that is tts; i am busty and the l fit just right with enough room without the buttons doing the splits like most shirts. the dainty details & material of this button down makes this stand out from other button downs that look like flannels--which this is not. it is woven of a fine material enough to be able to wear a camisole underneath, it is not a flannel shirt. colors are vibrant and the purple in the back really is quite attractive. happy i got this on sale & sale",1
"Although i'm returning, this is a cute top. the embroidery design on the front isn't really my style. it's a bit aztec-y for me.",1
"I ordered this in yellow after the size small in store didn't fit. it's such a cute summer top, perfect with cropped jeans! i'm a 32b and usually a size small but had to size down. i could still see the top of my strapless bra in the front so i wear a lacy bandeau with it and it's super cute. because of this though, i wouldn't pay full price so i'm happy it was on sale!",1
"I hesitated to buy this after reading the earlier review, but went ahead anyhow, and am glad i did! i ordered the white in a small petite, and it is as cute as can be. it is crisp and true white, not off- white. there is a large pleat on one side of the front to give the blouse some interest, and there are openings on each side which allow the blouse to swing a bit but do not open up to reveal skin. it is not long, but by no means is it cropped. it is really sweet with slim jeans or slim printed",1
"This is a really soft, nice, summery top. i love the criss-cross detail on the back, as well as the button down. it fits looser around the stomach, but not in a trash-baggy way. 

it mostly fits true to size; the only issue is that the top button doesn't leave a whole lot of room if you have boobs at all. i wear a 34b -- pretty normal, not large -- and usually wear a small. i've found that the top button buttons fine, and looks good when i'm not moving, but it pulls a little when i move around",1
"This is a beautiful skirt. great, soft, draping fabric. fringed along the edges. i ordered size large, which was an okay fit, perhaps a bit wide but the drawstring helps at the waist. because i carry my weight in the tummy, this made me look wider than i am. as an elder, i just couldn't handle the length which hit me right at the top of the widest part of knee. i have great legs but my knees aren't their best feature. so sadly, returned but i do recommend.",1
Bought this cami/tank on sale which i'm glad but it has a flap underneath like a bralette but not fitted..it kinda just drapes under the cami...the problem is it's not thick enough to offer the coverage you would want under a white tank ...but it was also too short so it caused a visible line underneath that showed through.that was higher than the bottom of my chest ..so it gave the appearance that i wore the wrong bra/undergarment...it simply looks awkward ...not sure if it would've been better,0
"Got this in purple and love it! ordered red and silver and only received red so far, but had to return because it was oddly shaped and didn't fit well like the purple. not sure what happens. maybe miss sized?",0
"I've owned a number of pilcro denim jackets it in my day. not because they've ever needed to be replaced, but because i'm obsessed with the fit, the color and the style. when i saw this one i knew it would be no exception! this jacket is even cooler looking in person. the fade on the denim is totally perfect. not too dark, not too light...and not so distressed that it looks sloppy. the denim is soft just like all other pilcro, and the fit is a dream. what i love the most is the interest in the c",1
"I saw this in store and had to try it on! it is really cute. i love the different textures and the red drawstrings. it fits well, although i am somewhat between the small and medium sizes. i went with the medium in case i want to wear a bulky sweater with it. really cute and i have never seen a coat like it!",1
"I love this sweater! i'm very sensitive to fabrics and this really doesn't bother me too much. it's soft, but just a tiny bit scratchy. but the color is a rich purple and the flexibility of being able to wear it draped or not is a nice touch. it comes right at waist length....little on the short side if you want to hide your muffin top, but otherwise a winner all around.",1
Amazing jeans!! without pockets on the front there are no weird lines like there are on other white jeans with pockets. the high waist is extremely flattering! perfect for spring and summer!,1
"I saw this jacket in a store and wanted it right then and there. i bought a shirt and scarf instead but it was on my mind. when i saw it on sale i grabbed it. the fit is a little boxy but the length was perfect! not too short. the small amount of spandex is so comfortable. it is versatile because the green arms can go with colored jeans well. i am 5'4"". i can wear a med or large. i bought the large. it fits perfectly to layer short or long sleeves. not a typical denim jacket. looks great over a",1
"This shirt is tough for me because i loved the front, which fit nicely, but i'm petite and the back had a giant extra piece of fabric that bumped out because of the cross straps, i wish it wasn't so wide so i could have bought it!",1
"I'm desperate for cute patterned shells to either layer or wear alone. i wanted this cute print to work - and it can, but it's just not great. the material is almost spandex-y, which is a bit weird. the only place it ran a bit small on me is the length of the straps, making the neck and the arms higher than i like. if i go up a size, it might be too much fabric and pleated swing around the waist. so close!",1
"This an absolutely beautiful quality stylish coat but through no fault of the coat, i had to return it because i looked like a bear in it. i'm too short and too round around the middle for this type check and this type material. i wouldn't want to discourage anyone from trying it.",0
"This is the perfect pencil skirt! the pattern is flawless!
the top shown with it here online is outrageously expensive! i paired it with a lace turquoise top that retailer has in stores and you can also wear it with a wine colored top. i would not wear it with black because you just lose the stunning colors.
if you love fall colors this skirt is perfect!!",1
"Maeve consistently nails pencil skirts - i always know exactly what fabric and fit to expect, and it is flawless! the fabric is soft, lined, and has stretch. it feels as close to wearing sweats as you can in a skirt! the colors are beautiful on this - i'd say in person the colors are a bit deeper and richer than they show in the model photo. length is about the same on me as it is on the model at 5'7"" and got my usual s with no issue. this beauty will go with lots of different colored tops too,",1
"The fabric , feel and design of this dress is sooo cute, but so large that sadly, it will need to go back. beautiful and softly flowing design but so full that not flattering.",0
I ordered the blue top. it's great for the hot summer we're having in the southeast this year.,1
"I tried this on (blue) in size 0 or xs (not sure how sizing was), regular size (sometimes i need petite). i don't think i need petite in this one though, i love the peek of lighter solid fabric on the hem, the whole tank is very soft. probably need a strapless bra to wear it, but could be paired with jeans for casual look or nice pants. pencil skirt for dressier look. i am 115 lbs and 30 dd for reference.",1
"This shirt is very attractive! i tried on my usual size 2 and it fits like a glove. i wish they had more colors than ivory, but i couldn't pass up the unique fit and design of this shirt.",1
"I tried this on at my local store. i love the look and the color of the blue tank and wanted very much to like it. alas, it was not to be. the material is super thin (almost see-through) and it is of poor quality. i did not buy it.",0
"I love the style and look oft this blouse but the fit is a bit off for me. i'm usually either a l or xl. i don't think it came in an xl so i decided to give the l a shot. i would say it runs roomy except through the arms. i found the arms to run strangely tight...and it's not an area i usually have a problem with. the body skimmed nicely over my trouble spots (middle). i found the neckline very flattering and it laid nicely over by dd bust. the v is deep but you don't feel overexposed.

This is such a cute and different jacket. of course i asked if they had it in black but i am glad they didn't because this is such a great color that is so versatile. i use it as a topper when it is not that cold out with a short sleeve under it or a long sleeve fitted shirt. you can wear with jeans or black pants if you want. great material for the price as well. i am usually between a small but more of a medium in my jackets. i ordered this in xs/s and it has plenty of room to even wear a swea,1
The softest tank i own. even though it's a soft burnout fabric it's still not too sheer. great quality,1
"This is such a cute top with so much potential, soft fabric, vibrant colors and flattering fit on top. however like so many of retailer swing tops lately it has tons of fabric at the bottom making it billow in a very unflattering way. i ordered it in an xxsp so i can't even go down in size so this top, regrettably, has to go back.
i love swing tops but retailer, could we please have tops that do not double for maternity tops??",0
"Don't even waste your money, even on sale.

bought three in different colors because i loved the loose fit and airyness for hot southern summers. unfortunately, one of them ripped in the first wash. i let it air dry and thats when i found multiple runs and a hole that i could put my finger through. one of the other colors was fine, yet still pilled pretty bad. the third one still has the tag. keeping the one that survived the wash because i like the color - but will only be using it as a knock",0
"I had my eye on this coat for so long. when i saw it was on sale and an extra 30% off i decided to go for it. i ignored the reviews that said it ran big and took a chance and sadly it did not pay off. this jacket is very heavy so if you are going to get it on sale, it will probably go into the closet for next winter. it was very boxy on me and tied at the waist, made my upper half look huge. it was just not flattering at all. the heaviness of it also made the big open neck a little annoying and",0

"I bought this top in two colors--i think it's a really cute, easy top to wear, but the fabric is extremely thin and poor quality. i tucked the front into a pair of shorts and i can already see a small snag forming, which i'm sure will be a hole in no time. two stars only because i really do like the look of the top generally, i just wish it was something that was going to last beyond a couple of wears.",0
"I absolutely love the print. it's what caught my eye first when scrolling down the page. the fabric is very soft, single layer. the model definitely makes this shirt look slimmer or tighter to the body than the shirt actually is. the slimmer fit was the next thing i was looking forward to, but like other reviews, it is very flowy and the fabric falls away from the bottom below the bust (which i'm not mad about when wearing this in the summer--the occasional breeze will feel nicer with a loose to",1

The fit of this sweater did not flatter my body-type. the top half did not fit well; the armpit area was loose fitting and the neckline was awkward.,0

"Soft, comfortable material and flattering with or without a belt. i'm 5'10"", 130...typically wear a 4. the small fits me perfectly and even the sleeve length is long enough when unrolled. high hem hits me a few inches above the knee, low hem a few inches below.",1
"I initially saw this sweater in the store and it really stood out. the rose pink color is absolutely beautiful and i love the glimmer band. it adds a beautiful detail to the sweater. the fabric is very soft. the only downside i see, is that lint did get all over the tank top i was wearing underneath. though i think that will change over time as i wear it more. it wasn't a huge inconvenience, which is why i still give this 5 stars. i am always a small at retailer, which is what i ordered, so",1
"Beautiful! caught my eye online. i had to order then reorder in a smaller size, but it is wonderful. colors are beautiful.",1
I ordered the shirt bc it looked soo cute despite the fact many said this shirt was see thru. it's true.. had to return it,0
"Really cute casual dress. wore it to a ""girls night"" out!! they all loved it. can't wait to wear it again with knee high boots!",1
"If you're on the fence about this dress - go for it! i am a huge retailer shopper but haven't ever been compelled to write a review until now.  this dress fits beautifully.  the materials is so soft and comfortable and the design of the dress is very flattering, with or without a belt.  i am 5'2, 118 pounds and i purchased the pxs. it's perfect!  i wore this with booties and received a ton of compliments. the fringe and hemline make this dress really stand out.",1
"I like this sweater, but it was like others i owned so i returned it. it is good quality and fits well.",1
"The shirt is cute, but there is no way that the length posted on the website is correct--it's a crop top. this was returned.",0
"I was initially drawn to the intricate floral design of the neutral motif. it looks huge and boxy, so i sized down to a 0- which ended up being too tight in the chest and arm holes (for reference, i'm 5'7"", 130lbs, 34a). i returned it for a size 2, which fit much better. in the end, i decided not to keep it because of the lack of shape, and it's a little unflattering for smaller busts. it does come with a matching cami and seems well-made, but it just wasn't for me.",0
This is nicer than the first reviewer states. the fabric feels very soft and the tunic does not look cheap.the top of the tunic was a little more fitted so it was a little tight for me since i have wide shoulders. i will have to get a larger size.,1
"This top is a joke unless you are really into expensive clown wear. i thought this looked whimsical, fun and a well-designed piece when i saw it on line--especially at this high price. i started to laugh before i even pulled the entire top of out the bag when i got it in the mail today. it is not expensive looking at all, and the pom poms look like a sad craft project rather than a special detail. it is a bit juvenile too. even if you wore it and were going for ""ironic"", it would be difficult to",0
Long enough to wear without leggings but also great with them. i also purchase the belt pictured and it looks as good in person as it does in the photo!,1
"I read all the reviews about the fabric being see through, but liked the dress enough to give it a shot. it is soooo see through. this trally could only be worn on a beach. very disappointed.",0
"The blouse is lovely - but after washing it exactly as specified, it shrank more than a full size. this is an expensive hand-me-down for my daughter...",0
"I was really eager to receive this sweater, i was expecting the same as in the picture. i received it today and i am already returning it. first of all the sweater didn't look new, it is mostly shapeless, it has little balls and piling on the wool (what happens after wearing a sweater for a few months) and the metallic color makes it look cheap. in the knitting itself there are missing points and there are actual holes in some places. it is a beautiful design but other than that not even the col",0
Little boxy in the mid section; very very elegant and beautiful design!,1
"I fell in love instantly...but...upon looking in the mirror, it is 100 percent see through. at least the black is... i love it enough that i am going to try to put a cami underneath. however, that mayn't work. the shirt is lovely in and of itself, but at 48, i don't need a see through shirt. it is also defiantly about a size larger that expected. so size down. almost so good!",0
The style was really cute but the fit was huge. i ordered an xs. i don't think going to the xxs would have helped. i ended up returning it.,0
I wore this suit for the first time yesterday and the black inner lining is leaking and causing stains on the white sections. seriously bummed as this is a super lovely suit.,0
"This blouse in the purple motif is lovely. unfortunately for me, it runs small.",1
"I thought this shirt dress was adorable but i am 5'8"" with long legs and the sides of the dress were cut just a little too high. nice soft material and i would have kept it if the sides had been an inch longer.",0
I was surprised retailer decided to ship this sweater. the sweater looks like it's falling apart and it is huge. i would not recommend this even at a clearance price.,0
"Everything about this dress is exceptional. the fit, material, workmanship, and style are wonderful. the dress even has 2 petticoats to make the skirt stand out. the dress is modern in style, yet classic.",1
Colors and patterns of this dress are beautiful and that's where it ends. cheap flimsy polyester and no lining. far too expensive for what it is. on me it bulked out in my chest area and did not look so great. i would say it runs a tad big but in my case ( i have wide shoulders) not big enough to downsize. too bad because i really love the colors and idea of this dress.,0
"I am not a fray fan but this dress has a modern vintage look, and it looks tailored. check out the ruffle sleeves, surprising detail. size regular small falls right above my knees, perfect at the chest (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips), but the sleeves are 2 inches pass my wrist. the ruffle sleeves are too pretty to be rolled up, so i got the petite s, sleeves at perfect length, torso fits better but length is an inch shorter (thank you, cloth and stone for finally making petite sizes).",1
"I saw the neutral motif in the ""there's only one left"" hanger in the store and tried it on. it's very pretty, cute and sweet. i wish the bottom flares out a bit more like a baby-doll look, but that's just my preference. i tried on size 2 and it's a bit tight in the chest area (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips), so i think size 4 would fit very well. despite the pretty flower design, in my personal opinion, i think the price does not justify a pretty basic tank top and fabric.",1
This dress looked nice online so i ordered it. once it arrived i tried it on and it looked even better. the fit was flattering as well. very versatile piece in an interesting print. glad i caught this piece on sale!,1
Looked really cute on line. arrived with a large hole in the front! quality and look was very cheap!!! would not recommend this sweater at all. step it up please retailer!,0
This picture does not represent these jeans .. the color is way off. they are more yellow toned and look much more worn than in the picture. they also run very small.,0
"I usually like coats and wraps with high-waisted belts, but this way too high, and the fit was really unflattering. i can see it being chic on a tall, slender person, but it's definitely not right for my short, curvy body. returning it today.",0
"This shirt is absolutely beautiful. however, it runs very small. proportion-wise it's okay in the shoulders, bust, and back but it's too short! definitely order up!",1
I had such high hopes for this top. it is beautiful but it is very uncomfortable! the lace/beadwork is extremely itchy. the button at the neck seems cheap and i was worried it would fall off. the beadwork and lace puckered on my shoulders making the fit off for me.,0
I received many compliments on this top. it's very cute and versatile. a pair of jeans or a skirt or capris all can work well with this.,1
"I love this top, the detail and embroidery make it great for during the day or at night. the small fits me perfect and i don't wear it with a camisole like some have mentioned, but might if i wore it to work",1
This is a great summer skirt that is good for work or casual wear. the fabric is soft and the colors go with most anything. one downside is it wrinkles easily.,1
"I'm so happy i decided to take a chance and order this top. it is gorgeous! so flattering on, the perfect length, beautiful colors. i could go on and on. peplums can be tough but this one hits perfectly on me. runs true to retailer sizing so stick with what you normally order. i'm 5'6"" and 125lb and the s was for me.",1
Cozy and nice quality. great fit and runs true to size. could wear this every day,1
"Purchased this dress for a garden wedding and received so many compliments. the print is very lovely and the fit was true to size. i was mildly thrown off by the waffle texture of the material as it caused the dress to be a tad clingier than the picture led me to believe, but it was not a deal breaker. loved that it was lined and, though feeling substantial, was not heavy and thus comfortable in 90 degree weather. looking forward to wearing this again.",1
"Big bust, smallish waist... this top is so cute and flattering! absolutely love it",1
"How cute was this little sweater and comfortable even in the south .... until i washed it! i followed the instructions on the label being careful not to wring it out. first of all, the smell was unbelievable! i washed it three days ago and it is still wet and damp and on top of that, it shrunk. even though i handwashed it, line dried it and pampered it to no end!",0
Sooo disappointed with how flimsy this fabric is. i think this is the thinnest of all clothing items i have ever come across anywhere in my life. this is really a shame because the colors are stunning and it is a nice shirt style. another con is if you have any bit of back fat it shows every lump and bump . i do not recommend unless you have a lean back and the cost was $5.00!!!,0
Purchased this in two colors online. purchased in an xs - i am usually a s or xs. the fit was really large in the xs and the seam on the front of the top was in the wrong place and was really unflattering. returning both.,0
I'm not a blazer girl but this one is perfect in the sense that it's not overly structured and stiff. it is really soft and comfortable but still holds it's shape. i am planning to wear it with a tee shirt and denim or even some leather leggings (pilcro).i can see this being dressed up for work or church. a great piece for your wardrobe. i could have taken a small but decided on the medium in case i wore something a little thicker underneath.,1
"Really cute top, the material is soft and feels like great quality. love the loose cut and slight detail to the simple shirt.",1
"I want to like this top because the idea is cute but i ordered the small and it might have well been xxxl.  with sizing like this, one size fits all could just about do it.",0
An easy top that adds instant glamour. the burnout velvet is super fun for the holidays and yet the design is comfortable and easy. i have found this top can work day and night with the right accessories.,1
"I bought this outfit online on sale - so i only paid $70, but i think if i saw it in person first, i probably wouldn't have purchased it. while the design is cute, the fabric is beyond cheap. it's not just polyester - it's like a plastic polyester. i think if you dress it up with high heels, necklace, armful of bangles, you can probably distract from the fabric. 

5'5"", 120lb, purchased xs and it's a little big still.",0
Love the cute print and texture of fabric. perfect casual t-shirt.,1
"Thought this looked so cute, especially for averting frame. it arrived and was too large, the fabric felt super cheap, and the lace detail on the shoulders was very prominent.... and not in a good way. returned.",0
"This is a find! i am always on the hunt for a unusual lbd so when i found this on a ""found and collected rack"" i went for it. for starters, i am 5 foot almost 6 inches, and it the length ends just about the same place on this model. i usually wear a size 2 but when i tried on the size available in the store (oo), i felt i only needed a bit higher sizing bc i am small in the chest. i am barely a size 34 a and probably a 30d at best, and i barely can squeeze my chest into this dress at this size!",1
"This blouse is gorgeous, but as other reviewers have noted it runs small and it's very thin. the back is see-through, not the front, though if you tend to wear things a little large and order up a size, the back is fine. my real issue is that it shrank so much when i washed it (on cold, delicate cycle, hang dry) that it's pretty much unwearable now. sad.",0
"This is a cute top that has a nicer texture and sheen to the velvet in person than the pictures do justice to...it's just simply richer and prettier in person.

there's a nice drape to the fabric, but it's cut pretty short and wide, which isn't flattering imo, unless you are very petite and have a small bust. i say this as someone who is small enough that i usually welcome a shorter cut top because most normal length tanks and tops are tunic length on me.

i would have given it a higher star rat",1
"I loved this top. loved it. the quality and color ( i got the red) are wonderful. the top fit perfectly through the chest and the a-line design was super flattering through the waist. however, i am long waisted and the top was simply too short on me. even when worn with mid-rise trousers, my belly showed when i leaned to the side or reached my arms above my shoulders. i so hoped it would be perfect with skinny jeans or leggings - as shown on the model - but on a long-waisted frame it is simply t",1
I absolutely love this dress. the quality is perfection. the design is adorable and it is comfortable! i paired it with leggings and short boots and worked 10 hours in it. and i worked a large event so i wansup moving things and active almost the entire time. it was the perfect combination of dressing up for work yet being fully functional! oh and the neck line ads that extra touch of style that makes it a great piece. love this! it is also true to size. i have a medium.,1
"This piece was so gorgeous that i bought it despite how impractical it is to wear it in honolulu. it's honestly the perfect little number to wear if you want to go for a late autumn/early winter stroll in the city. it's incredibly comfortable and versatile. i've worn it on cool mornings in honolulu as a dress with booties, and a few months ago, i wore it to minneapolis and added leggings and a warm pea coat. depending on how you choose to accessorize the look, it can be casual or professional. i",1
"I buy almost ever top tiny puts out and so i grabbed this one in the last tops sale since i'm a sucker for embroidered flowers. everything about it is gorgeous except it is so flimsy i can't even believe it. like when i held it up in the dressing room, i could see through the entire shirt, front to back, before even putting it on. once on, i could see everything through it. i actually thought i was going to tear the thing to pieces trying it on, it's so frail. i own so many tiny shirts and while",0
"I ordered these pants in black and green. the fit of the pants is perfection. they feel amazing and are so flattering. they do run a full size small. i'm consistently a size 6 in all pants (typically wear paige, joes, and frame and always a 6) but i had to get these in an 8. the 8's feel great though so i think they're just a full size small. 

secondly, the green color is not at all what's pictured. the green is hunter, not olive, and much less versatile. i'll be returning the green pants.",1
This was such a cute suit but strange how they designed it. top runs super low and it almost did not cover my breast area. runs small. i had to return because fit was way to small for a large suit.,0
Love this top (and every top tiny puts out).  runs very small.  i normally wear an xs but i got a m in this top.  so pretty and great detail,1
While i love the green color and the soft waffle knit of this top it was so wide i could have fit two of me standing side by side into it!  i mean it was truly laughable!  don't know what the manufacturer was thinking but this one needs to go back to the drawing board.,0
"The design is so cute (people in different yoga poses, small and subtle prints) and a must for a yogini. i love the colors, it's colorful but not too bright and it's beautiful against the white background. i ordered xs (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips) and it fit perfectly (it has a fitted look but not tight because it has some stretch from the soft cotton material). i like the fact that there's no stretchy spandex feel, just pure soft cotton feel. it's great for gals who are conscious about the arms",1
Love this top! it's light weight and very comfortable! it's great for wearing around the house or going out for a casual dinner. would love to get it in more colors!,1
I think this t-shirt is so cute. simple but cute. i originally ordered this in medium. i washed and wore it once but realized it was really too big. my normal size is small so i reordered it. it is slightly shear for my taste so i do wear a cami underneath. i plan to wear this to my 2 year old's gymnastics class. it is little yoga people but close enough! i normally hang dry all my clothes from retailer as they can be quite delicate but the first one i washed did wash well.,1
"Cute in theory, i love the bright colors, the tied black collar sash and the 70's vibe, however, the fabric is cheap, and the worst part in my view is that the seams that run along the front center of the shirt do not align the pattern. maybe this was intentional, but with the shirt i received, it looked horrible. i sent it back. i notice in the picture that the black ties are strategically placed over the center front seam, so it is a bit deceiving. i wouldn't buy this top at any price based on",0
"I purchased this dress for a summer celebration. i am petite, but ordered the dress in a misses size (one size smaller) because i wanted it to hit right at the knee, rather than the shorter above-the-knee length pictured. i loved all about the dress - the fact that the colors are more vibrant than in the picture and that is has a beige slip.. i dressed it up with gold chandelier earrings and nude sandals and got compliments form almost everyone. i am planning to dress it down with espadrilles.",1
"Love the dress! feel it fits true to size or slightly larger...knocked off a star as my dress arrived without the slip liner. i luckily have a slip that works from another dress...the beading is a lovely surprise! subtle and just enough sparkle in the sun, but not too much.",1
"I thought the dress in store for true to size and was a bit more 'swinging' style. i am 5'7, athletic and the small fit perfect.",1
"This is a shift dress, which is a great dress for many people, in a kind of man-repeller way. by saying that, i mean, a really pretty dress that can show off amazing shoes, good legs, a beautiful face and hair. this is not a body con dress. however, when you do such a high neckline and boxy sleeves, you do no one any favors. everyone has a nice neck and decolletage and collarbone. everyone. the neckline needs to open up a bit....i'm not saying v-neck, just a bit lower than this, because it makes",0
The title says it all. looks very pretty online though.,0
"Let me start off by saying how pretty this top is, and heavy,.and itchy!  you would have to stand like the model does in the first shot to wear the top (with your arms not touching any part of the top!  the sequins will itch if you put your arms down (underneath the armhole).  another reason i didn't like the top was because the should straps are unadjustable.  i would have to get mine tailored for my 5'2"" frame.  i usually wear a medium or 6/8 in tops and ordered this in a medium, it was roomy.",0
This is a perfect dress for work or fun. flattering and flow with lovely little subtle details.,1
I absolutely love this dress! the pictures don't do it justice. the colors and details are stunning! i have only worn it once this far but received a ton of complements.,1
"Like other reviewers, i saw this dress on the cover of the catalog and knew i had to have it! well, i am very disappointed. the colors aren't as rich as the outdoor photo, although they're brighter than shown in the studio photos. this is just not a flattering dress. i've put it on three times and taken it back off. the neck is too high, the sleeves are too narrow (and i have really skinny arms), and there's no ""swing"" to it. i am 5'4"" and weigh 120 pounds and bought a size small, which is what",0
"If the dress fits, there is nothing not to love about it. the color, of mine, is exactly like the catalogue and first photo online (deeper and richer than the studio photos). it is not too sheer, as another reviewer reported. it has a slip, and the fabric is beautiful.

the issue i've had has been sizing and style. i wear a size 2. i ordered an xs. the dress i received was not the style of the catalogue dress or the first dress in the online photos. i was looking for the very floaty, full dres",1
"Cute top, not great on me. beautiful, bright color.",0
"I bought this dress because i saw it in stores when it first came to retailer. it was stunning. the colors were vivid and the beading was intricate. i regretted not purchasing it immediately. 


fast forward to today... the dress i received was not the one that was originally in stores. the fabric was different, there was hardly any beading, and the colors were washed out and dull. 

i read previous reviews saying that the dress was more like the studio pictures than the original promo. but t",0
"This top is very beautiful and the color is a dream, but wow is it short! i'm 5'8"" and it barely hit the top of the waistband on my jeans. the fabric is oddly heavy and not light and airy like i expected. it seemed like an odd choice for a blouse. 

because of the seaming and gathered fabric at the top of this shirt, i wouldn't recommend this to women who are busty/curvy on top. it made my chest look huge! this styling may work for petite ladies, but tall & curvy ladies beware.",0
"I loved this dress online and was luckily able to locate it in a store about an hour away from me. i drove to the store to purchase it; however, when i tried it on, i was so disappointed! the print is adorable and it is made of great quality, but the swing style is definitely more than mini! i could have fit 3 of myself in this dress. it is definitely not as depicted in the photographs. also, the background of the dress is way more pink than appears in the photos, and the floral print isn't as r",0
"I was surprised at the high quality of fabric; however, the dress looked like a muumuu on. maybe with a belt it would be cuter...",0
"I really wanted to love this dress. it is absolutely beautiful - the color, design and details. however, whether it is the high neckline or the sleeves, it did nothing for me and made me look kinda frumpy. though i am slender, i have a chest. maybe that was the problem.",0
"I guess i am in a comfort clothing mood these days since i have been looking at a lot of them lately! this one is a nice thicker material and i like that the sleeves go all the way down, but i am not a fan of the design. i felt the color scheme was very plain. the neckline comes up higher on me than i would have expected and makes me feel like i am choking. it is not a flattering cut on me and does not accentuate anything i would want it to, nor does it hide imperfections. it truly is comfort we",0
"Had to return this for a couple of reasons: 1) was too small! it's made like one of those tiny mittens that stretches to fit any size hand. i didn't bother to order a size up because i wasn't sure whether to go from a small to a medium or to a large. 2) the main color isn't grey, like the picture. it's a black and white checkered pattern. so, it doesn't look at all grey irl.

i'm still recommending because, if you get the right size, and like the colors, it will be a nice, light and comfy swea",1
"Everything about this blouse is perfect - the color, the drape, the detail. so flattering and easy to wear. i just love it!",1
"This top hit at my hips not as it appears on the model in the photo, and i am short at 5' 2"". cute top, but shorter than i had expected and definitely not a tunic style.",0
"Love this blouse, it fits tts, and it accentuates all the right curves. the color is a lovely shade of pale peach, and while it's true that some of the buttons aren't cut, it's an easy fix, you just have to take a small pair of sharp scissors, and carefully cut the uncut threads--it didn't even take me 5 minutes to do, then you can button or unbutton in whatever way feels comfortable for you. it just makes you look and feel effortlessly sophisticated. busty girls, don't be shy--i have a 34 h bus",1
"I love the colors in this top, but i returned it for a few reasons.  the material is extremely fragile; with small kids i knew this would be snagged all over after my first day of wearing it.  my other issue was that it came to just below my belt on me.  i was under the impression from the photo that it was more of a tunic style top.  i'm 5'6 and it just didn't look that way on me.",0
"Love this--the chunky ribs, the retro striping, the conservative neckline. all of it. comfy, casual 70's-on-the-slopes vibe. leaving the house in it today wich maroon cords and chunky boots. so cute!",1
"For my body type, this top looked ridiculous! i am small-busted and thinnish on top. this seemingly very pretty top look like a big rectangle on me. very unflattering. hard to tell if it was true-to-size because it hung so wide. i think for a gal with more substantial upper body (i.e., boobs) this would work better.",0
"I absolutely fell in love with these comfy palazzo pants and imagined that i'd be wearing them all summer long. they fit beautifully, were true to size, and seemed to go with every top i owned. unfortunately, on the second wear, the inseam completely unraveled, leaving a foot-long gaping hole in the leg. i also noticed some stray threads along the other seams, so i'm not thrilled with the quality. it seems like they were poorly manufactured. i'm not sure if i just purchased a faulty pair or if t",0
"White, lace, peplum...all my jams so this top was a no brainer order. what i didn't realize was how cozy the cotton would be. it was like just wearing a cozy tee, but looked so much better. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, and the small fit perfectly.",1
This dress is thin and completely see through. it is definitely not worth the price tag. would be really cute in a thicker material.,0
"Great tee! color is vibrant, material is soft, fits great.",1
"Beautiful white top. peplum never looged good on me until i found this one. i am 5.4, 34 dd and this peplum looked good on me. most white tops are see through int he front and this one isn't. but back is a little see through. for casual that much see though is good. not sure for office. but this is still a keeper for me :)",1
"I would have to wear a camisole underneath this, which is odd considering it's still two layered in the front. i wanted an easy white shirt to wear, not something i'd have to layer.",0
Wanted to love this one so badly but didn't work for me. just looks really wide on me -- looks amazing on the model though!,0
"Love this top, the contrasting lace/eyelet is pretty and interesting. it flairs in a flattering way.",1
"I don't know who this would fit. looks so cute on the model and i thought this was going to be the perfect between season dress . . . but just looked like a sack! i think the ""knit"" must have stretched into an unnatural shape - especially the arms!",0
"The color of the sweater is beautiful, but the fit was awful. it was too ""swingy"" and made me look like i gained 10lbs instantly, (i'm 5'1"", 108lbs). i will be unfortunately returning this item.",0
Love the muted orange color and the design. it's lightweight and will be perfect for fall days!,1
"This blouse is so beautiful and feminine. it fits loosely and is see thru, so you do need to wear a cami underneath it. it is very comfortable to wear. i got many compliments when i wore this blouse. all the delicate lace on it just makes you feel very pretty in it. however, be extra careful when you do wear it. i'm still not quite sure how it happened, but the lace in the front got a small hole right in the front on my first time wearing it. it's so pretty i just hope i can get it fixed so it w",1
"Love, love, love!
this is true retailer! from the style to the mix of sweater types and the ""surprise"" pleats in back! 
i wore it for the first time yesterday and received compliments all day! 
so glad i bought two colors!",1
"Perfect! wanted a dress for a mexican vacation. this fits the bill exactly. fabric has enough weight to hang well and cover any ""flaws"". love!",1
I love this sweater. i bought it in black and love the way the back falls gently and flatters my figure. i'm curvy on bottom w/ a butt and tummy so i like to cover them but i don't want to look like i'm wearing a moo-moo. this top looks chic. it's the right shape to flow gently. it's just the right detail to be different in an understated way. i wear it w/ leggings and jeggings because it falls low enough to cover my butt. neckline is good-- i'm a 34b and it's flattering. not sure if it will fla,1
"The tank looks nothing like the one pictured, mainly because it's tissue-paper thin. also, i ordered it in two sizes - xs and s as it can be hard to tell which one will fit. i started with the xs and quickly discovered that it ran large. the armholes hit halfway to my waist. obviously i didn't even bother opening the size s. both will be returned.",0
"I bought this top online in the stripes/ivory lace. fits great and is beautiful quality. (i usually wear small/size 4 in tops and the small was perfect). however, i found that the ivory lace detail on the bottom sides gave me a saddlebag effect. not good. sadly it's going back.",1
"I knew i would love this dress, it looked so me !
my order arrived and sadly to say it looks awful
i was expecting 3/4 sleeves, these were to the bottom of my wrist. i could have been fine with that but, the entire dress was so big on me. it looked like a sack. i usually wear a sz 4, or s/m this was a small. will return.
if you can find one that fits i would recommend it.",1
"I loved this at first....but the quality is awful! it pilled like crazy and started to get little holes near the neck after 4-5 wears. second sweater from retailer this year with severe pilling issues. i love retailer, but will never again buy another sweater here.",0
I ordered two sizes. when the package came i was skeptical as it was very light and thin. both shirts were in the bag. the style is just okay. the shirt is extremely light weight. i was not impressed with the fabric. i am returning both. definitely did not think it was worth the price.,0
"Overall, a really nice top that is soft and comfortable. the arm length hits nicely on the forearm and the decorative detail at top is well-constructed. didn't keep this since the top made me look quite big in my bust, to the point of not being flattering. top is also a bit boxy, so i'd stay away if you are petite, with a larger bust unless you are okay with that emphasis.",1
When i saw the dress i loved everything about it except the arms made me a little nervous. i ordered it when it went on sale and it turns it the arms are worse then i thought they would be. they are like my grandmother crochet it and accidentally attached my child's dress arms on my dress.,0
"I'm very pleased with my purchase of this dress. it is perfect for dancing or a spring/summer wedding or doing out. it is very flattering on my rather straight/slender/petite frame. i ordered a size 4 and it was tts. if it only had pockets, it would be absolutely perfect!",1
"I found this pretty sweater to run true to size. i am between a size large and extra large and the large fit well. it is perfect in the shoulders and body skimming without being too flared at the hem. the lavender is a dreamy light sky blue, true to what my monitor shows. i rarely wear anything but black and gray, but i could not resist this color. the sweater is a medium weight and i anticipate wearing this at the beach with white jeans and now with pale gray narrow wool pants. i really like th",1
"I wanted to love this sweater. the lavender color and design with the pleated back was beautiful. however when i put it on, it added at least 20 pounds to my frame. unfortunately it's going back since the cut just doesn't work on my frame.",0
"This tunic is way over priced for the style and quality. it fit comfortably (runs a size larger) but it's not really flattering, it jut kind of hangs there looking ok. it is a little too deep of a v cut for a work top as well. this top does not support the price at all. it felt like something i could find at department store for way less. i will be returning it.",0
"I like this shirt, want to love it. i am keeping this shirt hoping to have better arms by summer when i can where this top with black shorts. this shirt does cling, it's a draping sort of fabric; i love how it drapes in the front. only because i am not happy with my arms do i where a cardi with it. also, the underarm area is rather open so i'll wear a bandeau when i wear this without a cardi.",0
"The wine color is beautiful, and the idea of a knot front with different back is a good one. however, both fabrics are thin, and the back is quite see through. the knit shows every single bodily imperfection. so, if you are the quintessential tall and thin, and you don't mind showing your bra, go for it! otherwise, i suggest skipping this one.",0
"The fabric and color are very nice, as is the cut, however this is entirely unsuited to someone as short as i (5'3""). i also have a proportionally short torso, so the split hits in the completely wrong place. someone taller is likely to love this.",1
"This is a beautiful dress. figure-hugging but covered up in places that need it. color is flattering and soft. wore with bainbridge layered necklace. bought for an afternoon function and wore with pumps. so versatile, will work for church or cocktail party.
great purchase!",1
"This is a great top but it is really big. i have a similar top from the same brand and the size small fits as expected. this top is easily 2 inches wider everywhere. i would love to exchange it for an extra small, but am afraid that even that size would be too large. the blue pattern is beautiful and the fabric is light and airy, which is perfect for warm days, but the size issue is out of control!",0
"The skirt is just okay. the design is great but the material is extremely thin and see through. there is a slip which goes to mid-thigh- very strange and felt weird as well. the pleats are okay but not great. overall, it is not worth paying full price for or anywhere near that. and again, be wary of it being see through.",0
"I got a petite, i'm 5'5"" and this comes to my ankles. pleats are attractive but not sure if they will hold up after cleaning, otherwise i would give higher marks for quality. overall unusual and a keeper.",1
"I typically wear a size 16/xl in anything from retailer and i ordered this top in an xl. it's more of a t-shirt with buttons than a blouse and it was overall too huge. it's nice to have extended size options but even if i went down to a size l, this would have looked like a maternity top on me.",0
"In a word .. clingy ... and not in good way. long so you need it to flow not cling. liked the back, but front was just too clingy. back it goes.",0
"The fabric is so soft, but it was too roomy in the top and miid-section so it didn't flatter my body.",1
This dress is absolutely like a layered cloud! the material is amazingly soft and comfy.,1
"I was really excited to receive this dress. it's a fun concept and different from anything else i have. however, the dress was way too short on me. i'm 5 ft 6 in., and the size medium was way too short. given the thin nature of the material, i did not feel comfortable keeping the dress, even for wearing it outside the office. i will have to return this dress.",0
"This tunic is very cute and incredibly comfortable. it is a bit loose, but you can see that on the model that it hangs off the body. i lose my waist a little bit in this, but think it's a good substitute for a thin sweatshirt and the button detail at the neck is nice if you want to show a little cleavage.",1
"I love this dress. i'm 5'8"", 160 lbs and have no hips, no butt and no waist. i have no curves and thin muscular legs. it's like wearing a cardigan and dress all in one. i paired it with ivory tights and dark brown boots and received tons of compliments.",1
"I was so bummed by this dress! i had high hopes when i ordered it, but was surprised by the poor quality and cheap materials when it arrived. the body of the dress is unlined fleece material -- it reminded me of material that they make cheap halloween costumes out of. i found the fit baggy and unflattering.

the ""shawl"" portion is only attached at the very top of the shoulders,

very disappointed. i already returned this.",0
"Plan to order at least one size smaller than you think, it's way baggy",1
"I really did. here's why i just couldn't: the lace strips make it look cheap. the fabric is soft, , but the pattern is undistinguished. 
the fit is very disappointing--medium looked square and boxy, the large was massive and in both sizes the v-neck was too low to wear without a camisole underneath....which defeated the purpose.",0
"And this one proved to be no different. the short end of it; this dress is pretty much super thick, heavy linen with a rope like collar (the supposed embroidery you see), and there is no lining, but completely unnecessary pockets. i'm typically a 2 or 4 depending on the designer (5'7 & a super fit 135 lbs) and knew enough to order an xs in this, however it still fit like a potato sack. even upon taking it out of the plastic bag, i knew it was going back. between the unrealistic pictures and lack",0
"This dress is adorable. it simply did not fi off the rack.
i invested 15 dollars in alterations to get rid of the very bottom side pockets- why where they even there? and to shape the bottom. basically the dress is straight all the way down the sides.by up and alter....
the top pattern and cut at the top made the alteration investment worth it to me- the quality of the fabric is excellent.
and the pattern is adorable- can be worn as little black dress, cocktail party or date night. the top de",1
Gorgeous details great use of materials -- yet the diagonal seam above the knee at the quadriceps cuts off the muscle and looks odd if you are the least bit muscular.,0
"I am a pilcro hyphen girl, and now i have these pants to love as well, super comfy and cute, the print is nice and subtle. i'm usually a 29p but the 29 regular is fine.",1
"Not long ago, i bought a pair of hei hei pants that i love, so when i saw these, i immediately tried them on. i love them too. they are pretty and comfortable, and i am so happy to get away from tight jeans! they are also very flattering. size wise, i find that i have to size down with hei hei, perhaps because they have a looser cut.",1
"I expected better from this top, it is thin, will snack easy, and you have to wear a cami underneath. for the price, not worth it. definitely returned!",0
I ordered this tunic in xl and it fits me true to size. it's such a fun piece to wear. i like all of the embroidery which was done in beautiful colors and stitched well. the different fabric and the cut make this a very flattering top. i tie in the green and pink in my jewelry and sweaters when i wear this. it's so comfortable too. i'll get good use out of this top for winter. i like the uniqueness of it.,1
"This dress turned out to be a huge disappointment!!! i was in loveee with the picture! in real life, not so much. the material felt thin and cheap! and the yellow was super yellow! nothing like the picture. i was so bummed! returned it earlier today...",0
"I didn't think i would like this blouse when i saw it on the website but once i tried it on i was sold. yes, it is see-through but with a cami underneath this blouse can be worn both casually and to work. the best feature? even though it's silk and the tag says ""dry clean only"", you can absolutely hand wash this blouse in cold water and air dry. i did and it came out perfect with no wrinkles! i took my usual small (i'm 32c and 122 lbs) and love how versatile this blouse will be.",1
"I got lots of compliments!
fabric is thin but not too thin, perfect for summer and fall. you can roll up higher or even down to full length or ankle (depends on your leg length). 
fit is relaxed but not too loose. these pants are stretchy and very comfortable. i have bigger thighs & calves with small waist and flat butts, i am definitely not a fan of skinny pants/yoga pants, so i often have problem finding the perfect pants that don't show off the silhouette of my bottoms. these pants solved a",1
I purchased this dress for my graduation. the colors are much more intense and bright then they appear online. i'm kind of concerned that i look like a carnival tent. i like the style but the fabric feels cheap for the cost of the dress. the fabric is 100% synthetic.the fit is great. the dress is true to size,0
"I recently purchased this tunic on sale. the cut of this top is flattering on my curvy figure as it has a cinched in waist. the embroidery is lovely and very bright with several shades of colors. i wore this with black leggings,boots and a green cardigan and received many compliments.",1
"Material is slightly thin- good transitional dress for spring or fall. the waist is not quite as fitted as i would like, but the neck and sleeves are perfect. the length is good, but i am short 5'1"" and 105 lbs- xs fit pretty well. a really good purchase- more of a workhorse work dress, and not a wow dress on me, but nice to pair with blazers, jewelry. don't regret the purchase. very comfortable. got compliments when i wore.",1
"I had hoped this bulky knit would be cuddly and soft, with suri (a type of alpaca) in the title. i don't know if the blend (45% polyamide, 25% royal baby alpaca, 20% fine merino) threw it, but had i felt this in store, i would never have even picked it up. unimpressed.",0
"I love this dress.
it is so cute!
i have another dress from the same brand (hutch) in almost the exact same shape/style so i was excited to see this one is so similar to the other dress i love.
i am 5ft 8in and 145lbs, and medium fits perfectly.
it's snug at the top (but not tight) and the skirt is full but not too full.
the fabric is slightly thinner than i expected, but still like it a lot. if i could change one thing, it would be one inch longer....hits a tiny bit more above the knee than i t",1
"The mustard colour was much stronger than it seems in the picture and it wasn't pretty on me. plus the sleeves were very wide so that makes this not good for petite frames in my opinion. it does run big - i ordered m (and i usually take m or even l in retailer clothes), but i could have tried a s to make it less boxy. too bad though, because it's a pretty shirt and different.",0
"I love this top! it's the perfect lightweight top for summer and the details are so feminine and pretty. the fit is extremely flattering. the arm holes are not too large (i.e. do not have to worry about exposing bra). i think you can dress it up with heels, wear it casually with shorts, & also pairs perfectly with kimonos. i'm 5'4, 130 # and i took my usual retailer size in this, size small.",1
Love the blouse and the best part is the back side ! this brand never ceases to fall short for fit and style. try it on to see,1
"Tried the xs in store (and 115 lbs, 30dd, 5'1.5""): fit like a glove, the chest part was fitted on me, the white is almost not see through, but nowadays, that seems acceptable (see though). the material is typical of meadow rue, cotton like, and airy. it is a basic white with styling. the top part also has some dimension, i overall thought this would look nice with my white shorts or with some nice jeans and blazer.",1
"I love the color block concept but this top was way too boxy. the shirt was pretty much square. and the top was super itchy, too. looks so cute online but no-go in person.",0
"This is a beautiful, simple, yet feminine top. a little tight in the bust on me - so i had to size up (and i am not busty). for reference, i am 117 5'3 34b. i'm probably in between a small and x-small on this - but went with the small.",1
"I had high hopes with the other positive reviews, but it didn't work on me. nice stretchy fabric and nice length but it was bunchy in the front and didn't lay well, and didn't do my bust any favors. maybe better on those less pear shaped. hopeless on me.",0
"Finally decided to join the yoga-wear craze and thought these tights and a few other pair from retailer would help me transition to this style. my size l tights were just that -- tight! so tight, i really didn't want to pull them up past the knee!! i am not kidding. i wear size 14 pants and my legs are toned and shapely, so there was no reason to expect a l wouldn't fit. so sad.",0
"Lovely cut, pretty creamy color, great top for strong shoulders, however. the upper section of this top is way more sheer than it appears in the photos. there is no bra that would really work with it--unless you want to embrace the undergarment visibility and go with one that has really pretty straps. just be sure the bra fits especially well, because any back fat will absolutely show. if you go without a bra, though: headlights. so there's that.",0
"This top is absolutely gorgeous, but i followed the care tag to a t and it completely fell apart in the wash. will be returning.",0
"I read the other reviews before i ordered this top and was a little concerned about the fabric, but it's fine. the neutral color is a little bland, but i can wear it with bright pants. since i expected it to run large i ordered a small. the tie in the front makes it fit like a dream, plus it looks amazing from the back.",1
I liked the idea of the diagonal color block but the fit of this tee was odd on me.  too tight around arms and way big and boxy around the mid-section.  going back.,0
"I saw this shirt and it was love at first sight. i have never had so many strangers randomly compliment me until i wore this beautiful top. fits great, looks even better.",1
"I love this top. i've washed it a couple of times now and i can say it holds pretty well unlike what another reviewer said. it's very good quality, for me it is true to size, i'm 5'2, 127lbs, 36b and the small was perfect. i wear it with a strapless bra. overall, a great purchase that i can pair with almost anything.",1
"I would have loved this sweater if it were true to the picture but the stripes are gray, not white. either i got a strange one or (as happens to me sometimes with retailer) the pictures are very misleading. disappointed because i wanted to love this.",0
"This one will be going back. the color is really blah and the fabric wasn't a texture i was expecting--it is kind of thick and ribbed and i suspect it would stretch out over the course of the day. overall, the cut and style is cute, but i just felt like i was wearing a hospital gown with the combination of the fabric and the style. this may have been cute in a more vibrant color and lighter weight fabric.",0
"Such a great shirt! loved the fit and how it feels! i paired it with grey jeans!
loved it so much i ordered it in another color for myself and ordered one for a friend!!!",1
"Ugh. i wanted to love this dress so much. i ordered it for a fall wedding and was so excited about it. unfortunately the cut is so very different from how it is pictured on the model. the color and print are the same, the detailing around the next are even more beautiful than pictured. the length, however is so much longer then pictured. and it's not just an issue of the model being tall. the slip is the perfect length (and it's actually the perfect slip), but the overlay comes down way past my",0
This shirt is extremely soft and fits well. great length and perfect casual shirt for fall.,1
"I so wanted to love this suit. it was gorgeous - the color, the quality, the style, but i am returning and can not recommend it. the sides need to be connected just a little bit higher and i think it would work, but there is no way you could move around in this without things popping out in front. i mean it would be gorgeous to just lay there in the sun, but i didn't feel like i could even walk safely, and i am not well-endowed. very bummed but it's going back.",0
"Very elegant feel and look. love the side zip, sliming feature. great all around pant to dress up with heals or boots for work.",1
"Cloth and stone has been getting a little shotty lately in terms of quality. they used to be a pretty consistently high-quality brand, but lately i've been left a little bummed. i got this in ""yellow"" which is really a muddy orangey color. i think i would have gotten over the less desirable color if the fabric were better, but it is actually two very thin layers of fabric that are stacked and snag easily (sort of like a soft cheesecloth). the shirt is definitely comfortable and cute, but the qua",0
I am loving this shirt. i thought it would look ridiculously long on me but it does not. for me this is a great substitute for the cloth & stone fringed plaid buttondown dress. it's definitely not a dress but is long enough to pull off the layered look of wearing a t-shirt and this on top. it will be a great piece for the fall given how incredibly soft and light weight it is. highly recommend.,1
"I am so glad i did not wait to order this dress. the fit is great and is made with great material. i am 5' 7"", 110 lbs and ordered a 0. often i have to have a dress altered but it is not the case with this dress. the length falls right at my knee. it is not shown in the photos of the dress but it has a buttoned back slit that has two buttons with a bright orange trim along the slit. a very cure feature. the bright blue back drop is hard to see on the photos as well but is nice.",1
"Great colors, style and fit",1
"I had been looking for a new plaid shirt for fall. this one is perfect! the yellow is muted, but i really like it that way. other reviewers have commented on poor quality, but it doesn't seem that bad to me. definitely recommend!",1
"This model looks like a bauble head. she is absolutely too thin and sends the wrong message out to retailer shoppers. this last catalog's models are anorexic and unhealthy looking.

i ordered this shirt hoping it would fit, but it's too small for 34dd. i am tall athletic and have breasts. 
i think of my shape as average - and the top didn't fit. it's cut narrow and small.",1
"Wonderful shirt, soft and flattering... usually wear a medium, but got the large to layer over tanks and leggings. could have easily worn a medium, but large is not frumpy at all",1
"Really wanted to like this top. the model has it on backwards - the ""v"" is actually the back and closes with an eye hook (that is where the tag is ? there's also a seam running down the back). the front is actually a high round neck. the material has a metallic thread and felt rather scratchy cheap. i'm usually a s or xs. in this top the s had too much material at the bottom and flared out strangely. the xs was too short in the front and moving your arms caused it to ride up.",0
"I love the look of this shirt. it is super soft and has a great draping quality. i personally love that the mid-stomach seem is see through, but if you didn't like that, you could easily wear a tank under it. overall good buy!",1
I didn't realize how much i would love this. wore it to work the other day and got more compliments than i have in a very long time on an outfit! it's comfortable and easy and flattering. bought this totally on a whim and so glad i did!,0
Fabric much heavier than looks in picture. also nothing mentioned in the description. great color and fit but i live in florida.,0
"I am 5'6"" and typically wear a medium. i purchased this shirt in a small. it is big on me. not very flattering but just a cute shirt to wear on a saturday afternoon.",1
"These pants fit great, true to size, heavy enough to withstand winter, and the knees don't stretch out as some pants are prone to experiencing. the one problem is that the zipper is exposed on the inside of the pants so it tends to rub against my upper leg and can be quite uncomfortable. it's nothing wearing a pair of spanx couldn't take care of so i've kept them despite this design flaw.",1
This shirt is like the best worn in flannel with a little feminine flair! super soft and great length.,0
"This shirt was a cute print, but it was too boxy and hit too short on the thigh. i considered having it taken in the waist but ultimately decided it wasn't worth paying the extra $ on top of the $88",0
"The material is super soft and the color is spot on. i have red hair, so purchasing a top in any red tone can be iffy...great transitional top for spring, summer and fall seasons! i accidentally dried mine, (thankfully only on the lowest heat setting) and it shrunk, but just the length a bit. one of my fave retailer purchases.",1
Perfect summer/fall top. can also layer it. i wear it over a tank tunic and love it.,1
"Pretty color, flattering fit. the flesh-baring lace inset in the middle required me to wear a tank.",1
Tried this on in store. was ill-fitting and sheer.,0
"I agree with the previous reviewer that the fabric and details are beautiful, but with the shirring from the neckline and absolutely no fitting anywhere, my shape got totally lost and i looked huge. the difference in length of the dress and slip really bothered me, as well. possibly great for pregnancy, because you look like your about 8 1/2 months anyway.",0
"This top is very cute, but i found it runs small in the bust, which is unusual for maeve. i will have to return it. you may want to size up, if you have a generous bust.",0
"I couldn't believe there weren't more reviews complaining about the arm size... then i found them!  yes, this is a cute shirt, if you have toothpicks for arms!  so true!  the shirt is adorable... a bit guazy (so not going to be super warm for fall/winter... but i live in cali so that's not an issue).  but, my arms aren't even big, and this shirt is so snug around my arms!  unfortunately it's going back :(",0
"Love this blouse in yellow! fit is true to size, and it looks a feels great.",1
"Soft fabric. great color for fall and sophisticated detail at waist, sleeves. a keeper!",1
"Material is very soft and the cut is flattering. i got the yellow and pink. yellow is more of a brown color, but i still like it.",1
I love the color and the cut! it fits well and i have a large bust. hangs very pretty.,1
"So this shirt is adorable. soft, fun, lays nicely...
but you should have your arms amputated and replaced with a barbie's before you put it on. 
i don't even have large arms, the medium fit me perfectly, but then like i hulked out the arms and there are now little tears at the seams. this was all very confusing and vexing as this shirt is otherwise perfection. 

i mean, i'm not a large? but i guess if i want this shirt, i will need to take it back and get a large, otherwise, it will be sleev",0
I really wanted to like this top but unfortunately it was short and the sleeves were just too puffy. it did not look flattering and will be going back.,0
"I saw this dress on the mannequin and wanted to try it on because it was so lovely. it was beautifully constructed... the lace is pretty, and the skirt is almost a grayish green, not quite black. however, due to my body type, it didn't quite work. the top cut in too high on me and made me look a bit short waisted. it was beautiful, just not quite the look i wanted. for the record, i'm 5'8"", 125 pounds, and wore a size 2 in this.",1
"Looking for the perfect camisole that smooths the flab, keeps you warm or cool as appropriate, doesn't ride up, and looks good? this is it! it takes a bit of extra effort to get this cami over your head and pulled down, but once you do, you say ""ahhh!"" it feels good and is a blessing--a seamless bit of control of middle-age, middle-body flab. for sizing: i wear a size 4 in most clothes, and in this cami, i can wear a small/medium or a medium/large. the former pulls in more, but the later gives m",1
My experience with these have been great and the colors are even more beautiful in person! they're easy to dress up for work and going out and easy to dress down for hanging out on the weekends. i am typically a size 31-32 and 30's fit me like a glove. i also typically wear petite but don't like the just-above-the-ankle cut of these so i purchased them in regular and wear them as pants. i can un-cuff them with heals/wedges or keep the double cuff and they hit me perfectly as full-length pants wi,1
These chinos are the best.  the fit is always true to size. the quality is great and the new fall colors are beautiful. my favorite are the plum. these are my go-to pants,1
"I have loved the pilcrow hyphen chinos, and have purchased many pairs. however, the last 3 pairs i've ordered are all a different cut now. they are no longer the chino i loved, although they have the exact same name. they are now ""boy cut"", and are much more narrow through the hips and thighs. nowhere on the description does it say ""boy cut"". it's not until the package arrives in the mail that i'm saddened to find this changed product with the same number. it really should say this int he descri",0
"I bought these in the mustard color and the salmon color.  i didn't have a problem with general fading, but used natural, mild stain remover (biokleen) and the pants were ruined. one faded where i sprayed and the other has a permanent water mark.  cold wash and line dried. such a bummer that these pants aren't every day wearable and washable!",0
Bought these pants for a long trip through south east asia. tried them on at home and instantly fell in love with the relaxed yet styled look. will be incredibly versatile on my trip which i need as i am bringing only ~15 pounds of luggage including the bag. they seem breathable and are light weight. super flattering as they are slightly slimming and don't bunch up at the waste. i got the greenish color.,1
"This dress ran large--maybe because the pleats made this dress too roomy. the dress hung on my right shoulder but the dress did not hold up at all on the left side of my body, maybe because i have a short torso/petite frame. i loved the yellow color for summer--it would have made for a nice dress to wear for a wedding. unfortunately, i had to return it.",0
"When i tried these on in the store i was thrilled - they were comfy as yoga pants and  the fit was divine. i thought i had found the perfect jeans and i splurged on them for my birthday. after wearing just two times they are baggy and the knees are totally bagged out, saggy and faded.
so disappointing - i want my $180 back!",0
"I was disappointed in this vest, it was stiff and scratchy and seems too big, doesn't drape well fromm the armpit and bust line area. not very figure flattering, looks like i put a blue shopping bag on and belted it to try to add flair!",0
"I would not have purchased this had i not seen it at my local (2 hrs away!) store. as the previous review mentioned, the red is gorgeous! very saturated color, just lovely. it does run large. i am 5'10"", 135lbs. i typically wear medium but chose small and could possibly have done xs but i wanted the extra length.",1
"This top looks great on the model -- a petite frame, small-busted body.  i am 5'2"" and have a large bust and curvy hips. this top hit in all the wrong places. the front looks very cropped and frumpy, if you have a large bust. the width of the top of very boxy.  the top is very soft and comfortable and the color is pretty.",0
"Love this sweater!  lightweight, comfy and does run large.   i usually wear a size 12 or l/xl in sweaters cause i don&#39;t like them to fit tight.  i read reviews and ordered a medium and it&#39;s perfect!  can&#39;t go wrong!  i ordered the red, but am now thinking of ordering the grey one!",1
"Contrary to some of the reviews posted the dress is not excessively sheer. you can't see black underwear thru the fabric, but you can see the body's silhouette in front of a light source. it's not lingerie sheer, but more like a medium weight gauze (without the wrinkles). if you're older or modest the sheerness may bother, otherwise (due to the print) it shouldn't be much of a factor.

I was so looking forward to an awesome maxi dress.  this was not it.  completely see through.  i guess you could wear it as a bathing suit cover up.  but be prepared to knot the length or you will trip.  its an odd design. absolutely not worth the price.  i purchased the sm/md and i could have for two of me in the dress. returned this piece without looking back,0
You can adjust this dress a bit with the straps but it's huge! the colors were also a bit grayish which i didn't expect.,0
"Such a great purchase! the fit is so flattering to my 5'3"" frame. i usually wear an extra small/small, but i opted for an extra small after reading a review; i'm glad i did. i also did not get the petite, but i imagine it would have a similar fit without the length this has. it flows, yet hits my curves in all the right places. i will say, i'm a c cup and if you have larger breasts, the extra small may not accommodate them as it is just right on me. the black is so slimming especially when pared",1
"I really love the fit of this classic scoop neck tee. i am 5'8"", 140 lbs, and 34 a/b. i am typically a size xs/s or 2/4 in all retailer tops. however, this brand (velvet) runs small. i had to order a size medium. the fit is slim to your body and is a little sexy with the low scoop neck! the fabric is very soft and a little thin. i am a little concerned how it is going to wash, it seems a little delicate. but i will wash it on the delicate cycle and line dry it. i ordered the black (classic",1
"I purchased this shirt in black. luckily, it was on sell. it can be dressed up or dressed down. it's so easy to just throw this on with skinny pants or jeans. i got it on sale too. i just hope that i can keep it for years since it will always be in style.",1
"This is a relatively cute top when you try it on. however, i don't think it will hold it's shape after even just 1 wear. it also doesn't seem like you could wash it without ruining it (like a shirt form a 'throw-away' cheap clothing store). i checked the fabric tag and it is a very high % viscose - meaning, it won't last long at all. i'm returning and feel frustrated with how cheap the fabric is.",0
"I originally bought this tunic in black, and loved it so much i bought the rose as well. normally tunics make me look like a box, but the tie on this one makes it super flattering.",1
"The dress is very pretty, but the sequins are dark blue! i imagined they would be silver/gold, given the photo, but the dress is essentially light pink and blue.",1
It's not a bad concept but i wished for more. i wish this tunic was a: different material as it was wrinkley and drop-waist design instead of at the waist. too bad. i wanted to love it but it will go back.,0
"I wore this dress to a couple different summer parties already, and i love it! it looks better belted on my curvy frame. i really like that the straps are adjustable and the versatility of this dress! 
perfect lightweight material in this summer heat. 
i'm not sure why reviews say its sheer- its not sheer at all! the fabric isn't hugging your body at all and you just need nude colored undergarments.",1
"I bought this dress for a holiday party, and the sequins on the dress were so much more blue that what it looks like in the photo. i still liked it, but when i went to try it on, it was just not working. i thought this was more of a loosely fitted look, but the upper bodice and waist seam are very tightly fitted. i would recommend sizing up, but be aware that the top straps (shoulder to breast) are too loose to begin with, so they may sag.

overall, i wouldn't recommend this dress for the curren",0
"This top is exactly what i was hoping for except it is missing the drawstring. so disappointing, mailing it back.",1
"I have a curvy figure, and this top is not for me. it fits loose at the top and is tight at the bottom. it is also short. i think this top works best on slender figures.",0
"I love this sweater, so why a lower rating? while i love the material and the color, it lost all of its shape before i even left the house! i am a size 6 / small and it looked clownish on me before i ever got to my dinner party.  i plan to wash it this evening and i really hope that this brings it back to its original shape and keeps it.",0
I was very surprised to see such dark blue sequence on this dress. it did not appear as it did on the photo. i was pretty disappointed by the color. the photo of the dress is much more impressive.,0
I am a true to size 4 and when this bathing suit arrived it looks like it's a kids 4. i will exchange for an 8 and hope for the best. the quality looks great and the styling is beautiful but i could barely get into the suit.,0
"Love this cozy sweater for layering. i purchased the green, have the cream saved in my cart, and also love the coral and blue too. 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, ordered size small which was perfect",1
"There was. a blue one in my store sale room and i decided to try it on, as i had read great review. bummer is i really do need hte petite in this. cut is flattering, adn material softer that i thought. next year...",1
Cute sweater. snap was broken when i received it. and i looked for it at local stores and they are all out of stock. ugh!,0
This was too big in the arms & i didn't like how there was only one button toward the top so that it made your body look hippy. little too itchy too. best thing about it was the look of the slouchy collar.,1
Possibly my favorite retailer purchase ever! like wearing a cloud & fit perfectly! if you're busty - not sure about it -- but otherwise wow! told my husband: hope you like it because you'll be seeing it all the time & he not only agreed but wanted to know if they made pajamas for men.,1
"I love this dress! it's cotton, but thicker/ higher quality. i'm going to wear it for nights out and to dinner this summer, and it's thicker material, so i won't even have to wear a bra with it ! it's a little lower cut, so be careful. i'm 5'3 and the extra small hits me right above my ankle",1
So soft and comfy. looks equally good buttoned as open. can be worn as a tunic top over leggings or jeans. the charcoal color is chic and i liked the different patterns on back and front.,1
"I wanted to give this a glowing review but i ended up returning this cardigen. the folds on top added too much to my frame. i do not suggest this for heavier apple shapes. for all others, it is incredibly soft and warm. the tan color was weird but they others are simply gorgeous.",0
I love this onesie! i get a lot of complements when i wear it. the only issue is that it's slightly too short in the mid section. it tends to give a tiny bit of a wedgie. but it's not nearly significant enough to give it a bad review or return it. overall it's comfortable. i did have to size up because of that issue but it still looks great.,1
"I was leery when i ordered this as i read the reviews and i'm busty. it is perfect for me- just wear a little bandeau underneath! i'm 5"" 1 1/2"" ,135 lbs and 34d bra size. also the length is perfect. i'll be wearing this little number winter and summer here in fl. will look just as cute with boots and long sweater! and did i mention, it has pockets!!!!!!!",1
"Just as described by others. soft, great fabric and so comfy.",1
"I love the color and style of this sweater and was very eager to wear it, which i've now done on two occasions. but now i'm concerned about the quality and also wondering if there is a long version of this sweater and a shorter version i am 5'6"" and thin, but the sweater doesn't hit me mid thigh - only goes to upper thigh and i measured 25"" in length on my sweater rather than 30"" which seems to indicate a shorter length than on the model i wish it were longer. more a problem is that the fuzzy pa",0
"I am 5'4"" and the regular sweater i tried in the store was too long. i ordered the petite online and it is perfect! it's warm and comfortable and can be worn different ways which makes it great for stretching my wardrobe. love it!",1
I really loved this dress. it ran small but it was also shorter than i imagined which was only worsened because i'm curvier on top. would be great for slender figures.,0
"Got this in wine, very pretty and soft. but so sheer, even with the dark color one would have to wear a cami. returning for this reason. having to wear a cami wrecks the otw ultra-comfort.",0
"I love this romper! it has a retro look to it, is super soft, and has a whimsical retailer print. the  pink color is the perfect shade too. the fit is great and i had no problems getting it on or off.",1
"The dress looks beautiful online, and fits the model great. when i got mine, the arm holes were incredibly too tight. everything else about the fit was perfect--length, bust/waist-- but i could barely drop my arms down when i tried it on. unfortunately it will be going back.",1
Fabric is not as rich as shown in photo. dress much shorter than shown in photo. shoulder area is tight and really doesn't blend with the material below. this isn't going to work on very many people - pear shape...just not what i've come to expect from retailer.,0
"In the words of my husband, ""looks like you're wearing a bag."" i'm althetic and short. maybe this works best on tall and very slim?",0
"Looks great from the front, but from the side it looks like a maternity top.",0
"I've been hesitant to try on rompers, in part because they seem complicated and i also too worry that i would look a bit like mutton disguised as lamb in one of them! however, i saw this romper and fell in love with the pattern and had to try it on! 
the pattern and color are wonderful, and i instantly felt glamorous, like betty grable in a cute cheesecake photograph! i had to buy it, and have since received tons of compliments on it (and i have yet to feel that i am too one foot in the grave t",1
"This romper is cute. i won't deny that. however, the rayon fabric made me really feel like i was wearing pajamas. i was afraid it would wrinkle horribly. however, the real problem with this romper is how hard it is to get on and off your shoulders. i'm short, but have a little wider shoulders, so, perhaps that was the issue. it seems like another reviewer had the same problem. there are only two snaps from the waist up and nothing to open it further from the waist down, so, i had to do some cont",0
This sweater looks great in the picture but when it came in the mail turned out to be enormous. i tried it with a belt on like in the picture but that just made the whole sweater bunch up everywhere. the quality is nice. maybe sizing down would help. but the medium/large is going back. i am normally a medium.,0
"I ordered this in lime, which is one of my fave colors. the garment was loose and roomy, and had the designer used elastic anywhere on the waist, i would have been in love! the shoulders were only tight due to the lack of flexibility in the bottom - no elastic at the waist and no placket below the waist to increase the ease of mobility taking the garment on and off - so if i had to use the ladies' room, i had to plan ahead. 

i took it on a trip and didn't have time to try on prior to leaving.",0
These pants are perfect for crisp fall weather and comfortable! i wear them with flats to dress down or heels to dress up! recommended for all shapes!,1
"I like the color and design. it looked super cute when i tried it on, but when i brought it home, i washed it in the washing mashine and hung it to dry and it shrank before i even got to wear it. be careful with washing it!",1
"I am pretty standard size 8, 36c, 5&amp;#39;6&amp;quot;, 150 lbs. i ordered the small and the bust fit well but the whole thing was like a tent and way too flowy for my taste. it was also long so everything was very covered. i didn&amp;#39;t feel it flattered my build. i returned!",0
"After multiple purchase and returns (from other sites!) i decided to splurge on a dress for my college graduation (located beach side). this dress was better than i could have hoped. the fit is very flattering, loose & tight in all the right places. the adjustable straps underneath the overlay ensure the silk lays perfectly. the colors are gorgeous and the fabric is light as a feather. the slight train & back buttons adds elegance to an otherwise ""casual"" floral pattern. i would highly recommend",1
"This is a problem i have had with the pilcro hyphen cargos with the color dye.
the dyes in these pants are the same thing. i wore the purple color and washed in cold, gentle, cycle and they were stained/ 

i will return these -it's too bad because they were pretty comfortable and flattering pants.",0
"Although the design and quality were great, this did not work for me. it was boxy, square and overwhelmed my petite frame. if you are taller, or have a longer torso, this may be a great basic staple for your wardrobe.",0
"The bottom part of this romper is easy to put on, but the top is very poorly designed. it needs a zipper at the side or less of a yoke along the back. you have to wrangle your limbs in somehow and i was afraid it might tear. once i got it on, it fit perfectly though. getting out of it was a disaster. i had to ask a saleswoman for help and was so afraid it might rip. overall, i was crushed that it didn't work out because the print is super cute and it is very flattering.",0
"I picked these up the other day looking for a good jeans alternative. i love them. they are the perfect fit of slim but not skinny. i went with my normal size (26) and so far after one wear, they are still in good shape. a little bit of stretch, but not too much. the moss color is so crisp and goes with a lot. they will be perfect for transitioning into fall.",1
"So, this is just the most lovely romper. beautifully made, flowey. very comfortable, until you have to take it off.
this is the review i posted on facebook. 
so, no man i know has ever ever ever experienced the abject terror, or maybe has not shared with me, that moment when you cannot get out of, because it has turned into a straight jacket, that otherwise cute romper. and again, maybe a man invented it!",1
"I'm so bummed! i absolutely loved the pair of these i bought in the bronze color great fit, great color, so comfortable! however, i just washed them and could tell right away when i laid them flat to dry that they had lost color in areas where they had wrinkled in the wash machine. so, now they have strange lighter lines running along them. not acceptable. 

i will say that the two lighter colors may not have this issue. for reference, see my stats. i bought a 26.",0
"Really, this top feels like a wonderfully expensive soft silk knit. it is just so very soft. the drape is really nice and there is stretch to it, making it very comfortable. it does have a tendency to fall towards the body, even though it's loose. so, i'd buy your regular size.

it's a thin material, but i don't think it's sheer at all. i bought the dark red/wine color and it's so classy! i love it. this will fit taller women easily because the arms and total length are on the long side (i sup",1
"I loved the dress, but just not dressy enough after rethinking what i needed. very easy order and return. thanks!",1
"The picture makes the shorts look structured. i assumed they were made of a heavier cotton material. i was disappointed when they turned out to be a light weight polyester. 

also, this runs way too big. i am busty and did not fill out the top of the xs.

i wouldn't even buy this at the sale price.",0
I purchased the stripped blouse and it was very large around the armhole. it bulged open as if it needed a dart. i even washed it to see if it would shrink to fit and it was better but not good enough. i hate my bra showing through the armhole. it's going back. cute blouse except for that. i love sleeveless blouses with turtlenecks.,0
"I bought the bronze color which was nice but the cut just hung like a dust rag, no fit , no drape
very unfinished looking. though i bought it on sale on sale, it is not worth keeping. over all it was not a worthwhile blouse to keep.",0
"This dress is lovely (albeit darker than it appears on the website), but i had to return. it runs way small?i usually comfortably where an l or xl in maeve (this brand), and could not even get this l on. would really only recommend for xs or s ladies (maybe m) who have the possibility of going larger. if you do purchase, absolutely size up 1-2 sizes.",0
"I'm not usually a fan of ruffles, but this blouse has a very smooth and flowing, front. it's flattering and feminine without looking frilly. easy to dress up or down.",1
"This coat is absolutely beautiful - an instant stunner. the style is very classy and timeless. it is definitely more of a lightweight coat than true cold weather wear. yes, it does run large, but that is the cozy look of it. it is not meant to be form-fitting. my one gripe is that - especially at the price point - if it's not going to be especially warm, it should at least be otherwise functional. the coat i received has pockets cut on the outside, but they are sewn shut. a coat without pockets?",0
"This top had potential, but the cut is very boxy and not fitted at all like the front picture shows. the picture from the back is much more representative of what it looks like. i'm 5'7"", 135lbs and normally wear either an xs or s and the xs in this was still huge and boxy, but very short with tight sleeves (i have small arms so hardly ever have an issue with tight sleeves). the small fit better as far as length and and sleeves, but still very boxy. the pattern and cutouts are very cute, but thi",0
"Don't be fooled by the image; unless you have a c/d chest, this romper has masses of draped fabric right around your middle--exactly where you want it least! very unflattering and rather expensive for the poor quality. back it goes!",0
The shirt cuts too high up and is very awkward looking on. sent it back. wouldn't buy even on sale.,0
"The high neck and ""square-ness"" did not work for me .. but might for someone else.",0
I usually pass on ruffles but this top is great! luckily i walked by this in the store and had to try it on. the material is very soft and can easily be converted from work to a night out. the v-neck is flattering and the ruffles lay nicely- i purchased this in the taupe but the green is beautiful too and will purchase it as well.,1
I was taking my time with this purchase i needed a top for a pair of ombrã© silk pants that i had tailored to fit. but everytime i put these pants on i couldn't find any top to come close to match..especially since the pants are for a more sophisticated look. well this top fits that perfectly and i'm excited to pair them for a nice dinner out. plus i was equally excited when i could pair the top with my jeans and sandals.,1
"I thought this would be so clean looking, in a theory/vince. menswear way, but unfortunately the cut of the coat is super unflattering. i waiver between a 2 and a 4 at retailer and erred on the side of caution and went with the 4. the shoulders are way off the mark, sleeves are too long, and the button hits about 3 inches too low. it's just...baggy...in a way that the size itself is not the issue. alas, this is going back, and my search for the perfect coat continues!",0
"I was disappointed when i got this romper in the mail. the picture looks much cuter than in person. although it's true to size, it looks pretty baggy on. also, i thought the grey (top) and blue (bottom) were too similarly colored; more contrast would have been nice. i'm returning this item.",0
"This is a gorgeous dress. the color is absolutely stunning and looks true to the photos online. the dress is a little too short and tight for a work dress, but too thick for a summer dress. it would be perfect for a date night, but since i have enough date dresses, and not that many dates...i opted not to purchase. it is gorgeous but i would suggest sizing up because i could barely zip in my standard size and the seams would definitely give after sitting.",1
"This shirt was on sale, and it was a good price. that is where the goods ended... the shirt was not flattering. i sent it back asap!",0
"This coat is spectacular. it was love at first sight but it was only after trying it on in a store that i decided i really wanted it, even at the full price. the design is unique and gorgeous, you don't see coats like this on the street, not a cookie-cutter. it's very soft, yet warm, and has a gorgeous ochre colored lining making it very easy to put on and a standout when a bit of the lining is revealed.
it seems the fit is what most reviewers complain about and i can see that. i tried size 2 (",1
"The design is beautiful but it was thick and too warm for a summer event i was planning on wearing it to.
also, the seam below the chest was uncomfortable.
needed to return",0
This is a beautiful coat and the fit and weight are perfect. my only hesitation in giving it 5 stars is that the lapel's don't lay perfectly flat. i read some complaints about the placement of the button but it doesn't bother me. otherwise it's a gem and i'm going to keep it.,1
"As others have mentioned, the proportions of this coat are a bit strange, but i do like the oversized feel, and the low button. it is really soft and i like the beige lining, too. there's room for a sweater under it, so layered it is probably warm enough for temperatures in the high thirties and warmer. what makes me a little crazy about it--i almost returned it because of this--is that the stripes don't match up on the seams. they are slightly off and i think the coat cost enough that a mistake",1
Really unattractive shirt. nothing good i can say about it. horrible fit. i can't imagine this would look good on anyone.,0
Super soft fabric! the opening in the back makes it very chic.,1
"I did not have the same experience as the reviewers. this shirt is not what i thought. the front is low cut and i would have to wear something under it. i could not wear this to work, and i would not wear it in public. the fabric isn't bad, but feels flimsy.the fit is tight. i wear a small, or xs in most shirts, and this was ordered in a small and it was tight. i did like the green though, and the color in person is nicer than what is pictured.",0
"This is even cuter in person than it is in the picture. it was hanging on a rack by the dressing room, so i tried it on on a whim and loved it! so, so soft too! runs true to size. i am 5'2 and 125 and got a small.",1
"I fell in love with this top the minute i saw it, best of all, i was not disappointed when i tried it on. the fabric is soft and looks classy, the color is a rich and deep emerald green and the quality is really nice. you can dress it up or down depending on the occasion, this top will look gorgeous with a nice pair of jeans or a dressy skirt. true to size :)",1
Great purchase! i bought the coat to wear to work.,1
"I really liked these jeans initially, but by the end of the day the waist is really baggy. the fabric stretches with wear and takes a wash to get back to its original shape.",0
Best jeans! fit is amazing! buy them; you won't regret it!,1

"I ordered the petites hoping the length would fits ankle length but htey do go all the way down. on a muscular bottom/thighs, these a snug, on the model they look loose, but i still do like them. to wear with longer tops... i ordered 25p for 115lbs.",1
"I just received these jeans and the fit it good. but they smell like moth balls and i have washed them twice already. i hope it will go away, otherwise i wasted $100.",0
"I love pilcro jeans and usually wear the stet fit. this is the first pair that i've owned that had so much stretch. they stretch and do lose their shape slightly, but bounce back after a wash. my main complaint may be stretch-related: after the first wear, the inner thigh area was covered in pills. granted, my inner thighs touch when i walk, but this has never happened with any other pair of pilcro that i've owned. i still have a pair of black stet that i bought 4yrs ago and they've never shown",0
"I finally ordered a pair of these jeans after seeing so many rave reviews, and when they went on sale. i'm leaving this review for women who share my body type.

i'm slim with longer legs, and don't really have curves. i typically don't purchase jeans with an inseam shorter than 30''. for reference, i really love the fit of paige and m.i.h. jeans.

these jeans have an inseam of 31'', which i thought would be fine. but for me, the cut wasn't flattering at all. i typically look for jeans that",0
"I am 6'2"" and athletically built, and i usually have issues with dresses being long enough for me, but this beauty has the perfect fit and perfect length. it is very flattering. the weight of the dress allows it to move with you. it is form-fitting, but loose at the same time, so your body doesn't look lost in the material. you can dress it up with heels, or wear it with boots or sandals to be a bit more casual.",1
"This is one of the best tops i've ordered. it fits well, it can be worn dressy or casual. what is pictured is what you get. if you are considering this top, it can be worn all year round! the price is not outrageous, and the quality seems it could last for more than one season.",1
"I ordered this in a small petite. with tracy reese i never really know what to expect in terms of sizing. i'm 5 ft tall about 118 pounds. i'm in between a 4 petite and a 6 petite depending on the brand, broad shouldered, slim hipped and very short waisted. i found this dress to fit a little large. it was quite shapeless on me though i did like the wide scoop neck.

i'm sending this back sadly. quality is nice, though a bit thin for winter time.",1
"This is really cute but does run large, if your in between sizes size down. the fabric at the front is super bulky but with a smaller size could be ok? it is so itchy, imo uncomfotably so! i would have returned for a smaller size had it not been so uncomfortable, ugh why! i loved the sleeves, very cute bell. and the back hung nicely. they need to make this in a cotton, vocoder and no wool! loved bit couldnt bear it.",0
"These have a very interesting cut. it seems like they were made for someone extremely tall. i'm about 5'5"" and the size 4 fit in the waist, but fell way below where they do on the model on the picture. it's hard to imagine who they would look good on, they're also very poofy right below the waist.",0
"It is a good item, just not what i was looking for. if you want a medium waist and straight at the bottom, it is great, i am more of a high waist, skinny bottom.",1
"I just tried these jeans on out of the box and they fit like a dream! i'm 5'0' 100lbs and the 25petite (my usual size) fit me exactly right as full-length skinny jeans. they taper perfectly. no hemming required. they are super comfy and nice and thick. they feel durable and high quality.

two suggestions for improvement: 1) i wish is that they were a uniform dark blue wash (but the fadng and whiskering is barely noticeable). 2) i also wish they'd place the butt pockets a little higher, especia",1
"There is no back zip on this skirt and therefore it does not lay flat as it would if there were a zip. instead it has an elastic waist. it is very nice quality but i never would have purchased this skirt if i knew it had an elastic waist. i am 5'6"" and a size 6. it runs a bit large - i think this is due to the elastic waste.",0
"I did not even pause over this dress on line - a white lace dress now? well, my local retailer at lenox atlanta - which has a petites department - had this dress in the window with a jean jacket. being a lace geek, i went in to find it. i am a big fan of the feminine and dressy, dressed down. great window display idea!

this picture does not ""do anything"" for the dress except wash out the true color. the lining is ivory - that vintage sepia photo look ivory. the lace is lovely ivory too, and the",1
"Love these pilcro jeans, my usual size fit nice like skinny jeans. i know if i had gone down a size they would look too tight in the legs, they are not supposed to be leggings. they did not stretch out too much all day - slightly in the waist, not enough to size down. the dark color is perfect for winter! they are very comfortable!! love pilcro jeans!",1
"I purchased this in my usual small (size 4-6) and it fits just the way it shows in the photo. it is very flowy which is th point. i wore it over a black romper and it looked great. i can also wear with jeans and a simple black tank. keep the vest open or use the hook and eye and close it up. seeing the black through the sheer white is simply dreamy!
glad i purchased it during the sale on sale promotion. it is a classic piece for sure.",1
"Best dress ever maeve does it again! tts and can be worn all 3 seasons here in sacramento 
love it and can be worn with a denim jacket or cardigan!",1
"Such a cute dress, i ordered the black version. i'm large busted (dd) and the slip thankfully fit (sometimes it doesn't). i'm 5' 4"" and went ahead with the regular, not petite, version and i have to say i think the petite would have been too short. the dress comes to the top of my knees as photographed on the model. highly recommend.",1
"Can dress it up or down and still look good in it! i wear leggings under it to keep my legs warm since the material is thin and i live near the ocean. this is my new standard summer dress! i bought an xxs since i am petite weighing 95lbs and stand 5'1""",1
"This dress is pretty, but there were a few things i disliked.

the overdress is fairly shapeless; however, the slip is fitted and well above the knee. since the overdress is sheer, the shortness of the slip is visible the fabric of the overdress felt rough on my skin. i did like the contrast of textures between the overdress, the slip, and the lace. finally, as other reviewers have shared, the buttons are not functional, and the v-neck of the overdress is deep. 

i recommend trying the dress",0
This is a great dress!  very different and light but cute details,1
"Citizens of humanity jeans are excellent!!! i prefer high rise & this brand is my favorite. i like the clean lines & plain design. the material is comfortable- substantial with just enough stretch in the material which makes them super comfortable. i'm not constantly pulling these jeans up, they hold their shape really well & wash well too. they run tts.",1
"Could not wait to try this on when it arrived, jumpers are tricky in the way they can ride up and become unflattering. not the case here, i usually wear a size 8 but i decided to order a size down for a size 6. i am 5'5 and 150 lb. being the fact that i am in the midst of losing weight i thought i would rather it be more snug and this really was just right. the pockets make it casual and cute, while the print and bare shoulder make it fresh and chic. you will love!",1
"There aren't enough great words to describe this dress. tried on the black one in store yesterday and knew immediately i was going to purchase.  everything is perfection - not tight slip underneath that even has the strap snap closures to hold it in place at the shoulders, not too low cut, hits right above knee so not too short, light weight, flattering, etc!!  and machine washable! can dress up or down. could even wear to work with a jacket or cardi. can wear all seasons - can't wait to pair wi",1
"I really wanted to love this dress! the quality is great, and the overall look is so lovely. however, i tried two different sizes (petite s and petite xs) and it still looked too baggy/big. the upper part is wider than it appears. also, the photos shows the bottom two buttons buttoned up. however, the dress doesn't actually have any loop holes or button holes, so it just hangs open. very sad to have to return both dresses.",0
"I purchased the mauve dress from an retailer store last weekend during their 20% off sale. i absolutely can not say enough great things about this dress. it fits beautifully... the pattern on the material is so pretty and feminine. once i got home from the store and tried the dress on again, i immediately purchased the black one also. i had to have it in black too! such a great dress to wear to parties, date night, friends outings.. we are going to california in september and will be wearing these",1
"Just as the others have reviewed, i agree! this dress is flowy and so feminine. i got it today and i am wearing it now! so light! i usually wear a large or a 12 in dresses. i am pear shaped. 36b bust and large hips. it is flattering and feels great on. the slip underneath fits perfect on me. grab this before it becomes iso!",1
"This is a must have for summer. i'm always hot but sometimes a sweater just doesn't look right. the short sleeves are just what i've been looking for. every jacket i own runs smaller on me around the bust and arms, so i think for everyone else, your normal jacket size should be perfect.",1
"They are beautiful in person, until you put the on. the fit was a bit weird; tighter in the waist, roomy in the crotch. the fabrics work 100% against one another. the vegan leather, especially the detail pieces at the outer side seams, is too stiff. the back is thin and has far too much elasticity. at $150 i passed. these will only enter my closet on sale.",0
"I am a huge fan of pilcro pants, and was so excited to see them make a pair of vegan leather pants. the idea is great - leather in the front, fully stretchy fabric in the back to give a fitted but comfortable look. however, i couldn't get past the way the seams and leather felt on my knees - really stiff and uncomfortable when you start walking around (can't bend the leg all the way; weird creasing and bunching behind the knee). the fit was perfect everywhere else. sadly, these had to go back :(",0
"This dress is everything i hoped it would be. it is soft and comfortable, and flattering even though it's not tight fitting. true to size as well.",1
"They are beautiful! they fit amazingly! they ripped on a seam the third time i wore them. i kept wearing them, because again, the fit! the style! alas, about the fifth time i wore them, the other leg ripped at the knee seam. they are just totally falling apart. it's so very sad. i would wear them alllll the time if they could bear it. i'm actually thinking of buying another pair because i love them soooo, but it would likely be wasted cash as i believe there is a real manufacturing issue here. w",0
"I really wanted to like these, but they just didn't look right on my 5'3 sorta bulky frame. i have big thighs and always feel out of place wearing leggings, so maybe i'm just not the right target for these, but they looked so cute and i wanted to give them a try. the waist was too high for my liking, and the leg openings were too big and gave me a stumpified look.",0
"I did not like this top at all-but had i looked at the fabric prior to purchasing i would not have. it is polyester-i thought it was cotton so there's the first reason i didn't like it. secondly, there is a piece of fabric behind the laces, presumably for modesty that refuses to lay flat. it wrinkles up behind the lacing, making it appear as if one is wearing an undershirt or cami that is not appropriate for the top. it is too long for me, the top hitting at top of thigh.
this top is just reall",0
"I am sadly returning this dress, but i would recommend it! it is soft and i loved the design of the dress. very comfortable. the only reason i am returning it is due to my figure. it is a fitted dress and was a little more revealing that i would have liked.",1
"I think this is a really flattering dress. i like the length of the sleeves (they're not long like in retailer's very first navy photo but all the other pics are accurate in my opinion.) in my photo, i'm wearing an xs regular so i'd say it's shorter than 35"" because i'm only 5'3"" and it's above my knee. it may run slightly small because i'm a 34aa, with a 26"" waist, 34"" hips and usually wear xspetite in retailer but this xs fits me fine (although to get it to be fitted at the waist, xxs might be bet",1
"I bought this dress for a dinner after my daughter's wedding rehearsal. it is perfect. it is dressy enough for the occasion. it also has a casual look to it. i think it is very versatile. i fell in love with the colors, material and the quality. i am more excited about this dress then the dress i am wearing to the wedding. buy it you'll love it.",1
"As a tall girl, i was thrilled to see that these pants come in longs! they are amazing for dressing up (or sassing up) and outfit. i anxiously anticipated their arrival and wore them the very first night i bought them. however, as someone previously mentioned the quality is poor. after wearing them to they symphony, the knee tore while i was sitting in my seat! i really don't see a way to avoid this from happening since i had not moved. i'm sooo upset because i absolutely loved these pants!",0
"I loved these pants the minute i put them on, and was so happy i'd ordered them. but i wore them only 3 times - and only at dinners with friends, not even for full days - and the seams on both legs ripped open! i think the faux leather just isn't equipped to handle the stretch of fitted leggings. i was super-bummed about this, because these pants are so insanely cute. but if they can't hold up to a few casual wears, then there's just no way... thankfully retailer was true to their brilliant custom",0
"I bought this today in navy and loved it the second i put it on. it feels great on, is well made and flattering! you can wear it anywhere and look pulled together. much cuter in real life too. it does run a little small. id go up a size if you're getting the white so it won't cling too much.",1
Received these in the green holly color (beautiful color) for christmas,1
"I bought the navy version of this dress in the store and thought it looked pretty nice. i am 5'10"" and 145 pounds, and the small fit me great. i think that the dress looks exactly like it does in the pictures, at least for the particular color that i bought; the length comes about mid-thigh, as shown, and i would definitely have worn it to work. after looking in the mirror for a few more days though, i decided to return the dress, because i didn't feel like the shape of it was especially sensati",0
I'm 5 feet 120 and hourglass figure. i literally burst out laughing when i opened the package. i ordered my usual small petite. the dress is so short and small you would have to be 4 feet 90 pounds. returning.,0
"So i have had to return this once so far because the stitching ripped out when i sat down. the little slip thing that goes underneath if cheaply made. i really wish this were just lined dress. i wear it with a blank tank top and leggings underneath. not worth the money, but i needed something to wear that was transitional.",0
"I fell in love with this dress but when i received it in the mail, i was really surprised to see that unlike the picture online, the slip underneath is a nude color. it fit well and i decided to keep it. i wore it for the first time today and felt great in it. i was driving with my son in the back seat, i turned to hand him something and the entire right side of the dress (where the crocheting is) ripped open!! i cannot believe how poor the quality is at this price!",0
"I have a few of these tees in the short sleeve version and found myself wearing them pretty often so i jumped on the long sleeve option when it went on sale. i bought the black and red (which is more of an orangey red). i love them as well! this top drapes nicely and has a little more style than just a plain tee. the material is thin and while that is nice for breeziness sake, i don't anticipate this will last that long, but thats cool...its not a real investment piece but rather a cute casual t",1
"This is the perfect tank. it's super soft, great colors and with a shape that allows you to wear a regular bra. best of all, it was offered in petitie sizes. for me that means i finally have a tank that doesn't gap at the arms or scoop too low or flood me with excess length. thank you retailer for remembering us petitie girls with this wonderful tank!",1
These tanks are very soft. i have two black and one coral. i had to return the white as it was see through. they do shrink in the wash even without drying all the way and on low heat so maybe size up if you're in between sizes. i recommend these tanks for sure,1
"I loved this dress and ordered it online. i found the colors to be a bit more muted than i expected, and unfortunately the fabric quality seemed low considering the price point. ultimately i decided to return it as i couldn't justify spending $178 on a dress that didn't seem as well made as i would expect from retailer.",0
"I ordered this style in the blue, red, yellow and white for the sale price. they all fit true to size, matching the model's photos. but, the quality is poor. the hems are frayed, they wrinkle easily, they're just a mess. the model's photos show a messy look so you know what you're getting. the positives are the colors. the blue is especially gorgeous. the yellow is like a spicy mustard shade. they are all comfortable. just sloppy looking. the sale price matches the quality. they do stretch out t",0
"Beautiful spring dress. perfect for luncheons or any occasion. so very pretty, lovely fabric and good fit. you will definitely feel pretty in this dress. y daughter is 5'3"" and the length was perfect.",1
"I wanted to like this top, especially because of its comfortable material and color, but the asymmetrical shape didn't hang well on me. it also runs big - i got a small, and although the bodice fit okay, the sleeves were long, and the bottom of the top looked mishaped and dumpy. this top will be going back.",0
"First problem-i would not have ordered this at all had the description been correct. the fabric description is cotton which the dress is most certainly not. secondly, it has a really funky, cheap, unfinished, raw-hemmed slip which is simply not fitting for the dress. the keyhole in the front is super long-again, does not seem to fit the dress. i am not happy with this piece at all but it did fit tts. length is just above knee. i am 5'5"" 142 lbs 34d and the six was a good fit. sending this home t",0
"I never write reviews, but i just purchased this top at full price last week in the store. it's not a have to have top just to look at it, but once i put it on i had to have it. it's extremely comfortable and i am able to wear it while running around with my boys and still feel as though i'm put together. 

i've worn this top now 2 times and after the 2nd wear i have 3 holes in the area where the waist line of my jeans sits. the first time i wore this top it was for only and hour or so. what a",0
"These shirts are fantastic; lightweight sleeves for summer wear. i go back and forth between xs and small, (i have broad shoulders) and ordered one of each. i like both. the shirt has give so the xs is fine but the variation in size gives the two shirts very different looks.

the color is fantastic and true to the photos! not always the case with online purchasing so i loved that.",1
"I ordered a regular size 6 because the petite size 6 was sold out. it was too large for me; maybe the 4 would have worked. in part because the size was off, it looked frumpy on me with the poofs and flowers. however, i did like that it is cotton and has its own beige-colored slip that snaps on at the shoulders. i have no doubt this could look very nice on someone if the size was just right.. i like the black crochet-type details.",1
"Really cute sweater, well made, but so intensely itchy i couldn't keep it on for more than 30 seconds !",0
"I was really excited about this dress- the style looked like it would be a spring/summer staple in my retailer-heavy wardrobe. i was really surprised when i received it in the mail. the dress is quite thin cotton fabric and feels cheaply made. for the price, i could purchase a much higher quality dress elsewhere that would hold up better. i've been an retailer fan for more than an decade, but this trend of higher prices for lower quality is disappointing and insirpring me to leave a review for the f",0
"Should have listened 2 a previous review! while this is a very well made garment, it really does remind me of a bathrobe, and will be returning :( too bad because the fabric and stripes are really great. also...this runs very large. the extra small was more like a medium.",0
I wanted to like this one.. really but it was just plain sloppy looking. i returned it.,0
"This jacket is beautiful. the color is so nice and the cut of the jacket is perfect. however, one i put it on, i couldn't wait to get it off. it's so itchy!! i tried putting on a long sleeve shirt under it but was still uncomfortable. especially around my neck. i wouldn't recommend this jacket based on the material alone. also, the jacket runs large. i'm 5'1"" 130 lbs 34d and i ordered the small. i would definitely size down.",0
"Very pretty top. runs a bit large (i generally take an xs and the xs in this top fits me a little longer and larger than on the model). comfortable and easy to wear. nice cut with angled front and bit longer back. did develop a small hole very quickly as some thinner and tissue tees do but hoping that's unusual as i did buy two different colors of this tee shirt and will be totally disappointed if this happens to both, especially at this price.",1
"When i tried it on it looked like a stiff bathrobe. straight, too boxy.",0
Great with leggings and skinny jeans! it's comfortable too!,1
"I like this top. in the photo, the white in the print stands out. in-person, the white areas of the print (not embroidery) is dull, more like beige. the flowers and embroidery itself looks good, the print looks good. it is a swing top, looks better on a slender frame. such loose fitting tops just don't look good on my curvy frame. i sized down, could have tried 2 sizes down but the shoulder area was more fitted. i recommend the top for a more slender frame or if you like very loose fitting tops.",1
"Beautiful color, design and fit.  but i couldn't wait to get it off.  i don't have sensitive skin and don't recall ever putting a jacket on that felt like steel wool.",0
"I saw this in the store and purchased it right on the spot (didn't even see the reviews until now). i can wear either a small or x-small in retailer but for this top, the x-small was a better fit as it draped nicely and was still very loose on me (i'm 5'4, 125 lbs, 34b). i was worried that the opening was too wide but it was perfect. i like the elbow length sleeves and the fact that the blouse is lined which mean it's not sheer and don't have to wear a camisole. i usually stick with the classics i",1
"This looks nothing like it does on the website. it runs small and the colors are so muddy. it doesn't drape nicely and i a musually an xs and this was short, stiff and plain ugly. sent it back immediately.",0
"Love this top and i think it is a great transition piece - i live in texas, so our temps stay high until october. this top in the purple motif color is perfect, since the colors aren't look too summery, but the fabric is lightweight. this top is a little bit boxy, but drapes nicely so it won't make you look wide. as with most holding horses tops, this runs a little big so size down unless you need the length.",1
I saw this blouse in the store a few weeks ago and thought it was really pretty- great colors and fun beading around the wrists & hem. went online to order the petite size and when it arrived i literally couldn't believe it was the same shirt! it was so washed out compared to the one in the store and the petite size is very short (and i'm only 5 feet tall so that's saying something!). the neckline is very wide and open- not even sure what kind of bra wouldn't show?? sadly i wasted the shipping c,0
"I absolutely love this top, it washed up nicely and is perfect for body style. short waist nice soft colors. i ordered another top that is this style. perfect first time i wore it i received so many compliments.",1
"I got these on sale mid-summer at retailer and they quickly became my go-to summer slacks for the office. i work in washington dc and jerusalem -- two really hot cities -- and these are comfortable yet professional. with a sleeveless blouse, jacket and heeled sandals they are professional, with flat sandals and a t-shirt perfect for a weekend. they travel quite well and don't instantly wrinkle the way most linen slacks do. think ahead to next summer and grab them.",1
Material is awful. not soft at all. colors are much darker than shows online. it is actually very short not at all as it looks on the model. it went back.,0
"I just can't get past how different the blouse i got is from the photo. mine has dark colors, really dark colors.  this top fits a bit large and the neck is quite wide. i thought it flowed well and fit nicely in my regular size large. i liked the length and the fact that it's shorter than shown. it still covered my bum.  the back has a cute peplum ruffle and there are little bronze colored beads along the bottom edge in both the front and back. i would have kept it had been the blouse shown in t",0
"I ordered this in the darker color. i was excited to try it on when it arrived the fabric was really nice, good quality and the design is so cute. sadly it did not work for me. there is a lot of volume especially in the back which does not work for my curvy shape. i can see this top working well on a straighter figure but the volume and length really just did not flatter my hips and thighs. i will be sending this back.",1
"This top is much stiffer, more baby-doll and boxier than pictured. lining is stiff too, and colors more muddy than shown. i wear boho tops all the time and this looked terrible on me (i have broad-ish shoulders and a chest). i thought it would be a fun, drapey top for transition to fall but unfortunately it's going back.",0
"I've been shopping at retailer since 2007, and floreat used to be my favorite designer, but for the past year or more, floreat mostly misses the mark. this blouse looks nothing like it does on the model. 
1. it is long on her, not so in real life. this is probably the worst part about this blouse. if it were not for this, i might try on a size m and give it another chance.
2. it runs very large. i usually take a l or xl. i think i would need a m in this, as mentioned above.
3. in the picture, t",0
I had high hopes for this top. i love the plaid and design but found it too boxy and short. the front was cut too low as well.,0
"I agree with the other reviewers, this top is completely disappointing in every way, i could not believe it was the same top i pulled from the bag. where to begin,.......
it runs really big
it's short and boxy, not at all like it appears on the model, this must be pinned a lot in this picture.
colors are completely dull in person, i really think this picture was lightened a great deal.
fabric feels cheap and stiff
lining is stuff and poorly sewn.
i haven't one positive thing to say about t",0
Really cute over my white cropped pilcro jeans. or as a beach cover up over a bathing suit. i want this in more colors!,1
"I love the length of this and that i can wear it with skinny jeans or leggings, but it does seem to run a little small and it is not as long as on the model. i do think it is a cute addition to my wardrobe though.",1
I love this tee. very soft and easy care. gentle cycle hand to dry.,1
"I usually wear a medium in jackets, took a chance with the small in this coat. it fits well, the arms are a bit snug but not too snug. beautiful design though. biggest disappointment was quality. i thought the jacket would be thick and warm. it's pretty thin, will test out warmth soon. overall decent purchase, would buy again.",1
"This hoodie is beautiful, soft and flattering. but the soft fabric pilled badly after one wearing and it's probably going to look ratty after a few washings. i might accept pilling in a $30 sweatshirt but not at this price. i don't really want to take it back but i will. (i've complained to retailer employees in the past about other clothes pilling and poor quality, and they've always said i could bring it back)",0
"I tried on the dress that was returned at my store in xxs p, i would not have based on reviews but my stylist asked me to try it on. it does look nice, you just have to cinch it all the way. perhaps most people do need to size down. for my 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5in waist, i wouldn't go up to xs p... to give an idea. 
material is nice and sturdy. give ti a try!",1
This is a beautiful dress. all that's missing is a bonnet!,0
"It's beautiful, but more sheer on bottom than it appears in photo. size up.",1
"This dress is really good quality and the beading is adorable. but, the sleeves combined with the maxi skirt made me look like i was a sister wife and not in a $250 dress. i still gave it four stars though, because i am having it hemmed to above the knee because i like the top part so much. i ordered the 00p, am 5'1 110 lbs and the waist fit perfect, the skirt was about three inches above my ankles. perhaps someone with a more boho style might find the length of the skirt cute but i just found i",1
"This dress is not flattering. the slip is very small and short and the dress is big and billowy. like the other reviewer said, its more like a tablecloth that you stick your head through. it was really hard to figure out how to cinch in the waist but it didn't help regardless. the length is not accurate either. i would say it's a pretty short dress (mid thigh) but that probably depends on the person. it also makes you look very horizontal. i was really excited about this dress but it's getting r",0
"What a shame this dress is. i wear xl and am 5'2"", but the dress in the store in the size xs(!!!!!) looked just the right size. yup! xs was just the right size. i can't imagine anyone who wears m or s finding this dress fit flattering. it would look like a sack. it is an inch or two too short in the front for me, so i'll be returning it.",0
"This dress is very good quality, with beautiful beading on the bodice. it's a heavier material than i was expecting, but that was a pleasant surprise. unfortunately, when i put it on and looked in the mirror, i laughed out loud because i looked like a fancy swiss milkmaid. the shoulders are puffier than shown on the model and, combined with the overall design and length, i couldn't think of anywhere to wear it. this is an easy return for me. the dress runs very true to size and the bodice is fit",1
"After reading the other reviews, i had to write my own. i think this dress is adorable. it is a tunic and advertised as such. i think the drawcord and the way it is styled is really different and gives the dress some pop. i am 5'4"" so the length is good for me. i didn't have trouble with the arms as some did. the slip was a problem , too small, especially considering the dress is a tunic and fits as a tunic. the dress fits me as it does the model. with a pair of cute boots, this dress rocks.",1
"I loved the look of this dress online so i went to retailer to try it on. in the dressing room area we were all laughing because (i tried on a small) when i got it tied to the point where it looked like the model online i couldn't raise my arms. the distance between the cuff and the waist is inches! even if you manage to lift your arms the whole dress will go with it and expose you as much as if you weren't wearing a dress at all but a shirt. too bad. poor design for sure, and such a shame when th",0
Large and the material is too bulky. i returned it.,0

"I'm a petite girl, 5' and 100lbs. ordered regular size xs since others mentioned this being ""short"" or ""cropped"". this sweater is adorable, not itchy in my opinion, and the lenght is just right, not short, not long, however it may be a bit short for tall girls...still think it's worth a try.",1
"I really love this dress! the fit is flattering and comfortable. the fabric has a pale art nouveau background, with indian and middle eastern prints over it. the beadwork does ""really pop,"" and the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. for lovers of etro's bohemian style who don't want to spent thousands of dollars on a dress . . .",1
"I'll start by saying, over the years, i get more and more frustrated by the lowered quality of retailer's products. this dress represents all of my frustration. cheap, cheap cheap material. low thread count. elastic!!! around the end of the sleeves that rubs the cheap fabric against your arm. i mean, this dress is a total disaster - and looks nothing like the photograph shown.",0
"I was so excited to receive this dress. i got a petite 4 as i am 5'2"". it was very hard to zip up the side zipper but not impossible. it didn't look good on me. the waist line was a bit too high...maybe a regular would have looked better. also i thought it was a cotton dress but it isn't. also i looked like i was going to a nordic folk festival to do a traditional dance. i had been so excited to receive this but sadly it just didn't work for me and i had to send it back.",0
"I agree with almost everything the previous reviewer said with one notable exception: probably because she and i have very different figures, i am able to wear the sweater fully snapped with the belt cinching my waist creating a peplum effect. i wore this jacket to a party as a top over a black band aid skirt (code for tight-fitting and tastefully short) with black semi-opaque tights and black booties. the look was classy, but edgy having paired a delicate floral pattern and unusually feminine n",1
"Absolutely beautiful jacket...the craftsmanship is amazing, and the colors remind me of a impressionist water color. the jacket runs true to size (i'm 5'7"" and 115 pounds with a 30e bust and the extra small fit perfectly). unlike the other reviewers, i didn't have issue with the bottom not lying flat or the collar bunching up. i wore it with a green leather pencil skirt and suede stilettos, but you can also wear it with skinny jeans as well.i got this very deeply discounted, and although it is i",1
"I wanted to love this because it's all my favorites: simple, chic design; pure silk; gorgeous color. in reality, the dress was 100% see-through, very thin, and poor quality silk. i posted pictures of me wearing this dress with a nude slip on underneath that i brought along for shopping elsewhere for business dresses. despite the thin quality of the silk, i was still considering spending this dress (despite it's unreasonably high $$$ for the quality), but after trying it on i was really disappoin",0

It does snag easily which stinks because it's darling and i love it to pieces.... i just hope it doesn't end up in pieces!,1

"Soft, elegant, beautiful and makes me feel special! what more could one ask for? fit is true to size and has various styling options. best retailer purchase in some time.",1
"Great wardrobe staple! at 119, i ordered the s and the fit was great. you can wear this so many ways and it's soft!",1
"I love the long tunic with high slits, it's such a great design. i bought this on sale on a whim. i did see that there was already a small snag on the one i purchased right after i took it out of the bag, must have missed that when i looked at it in the store. i still love it, just a little worried based on other reviews that i won't be able to keep from snagging in the future. at the sale price i would say still worth it though!",1
"I wore this blazer for one day, didn't do anything strenuous, and the fabric started to disintegrate along the back, next to the center seam. it's completely unfixable, since it's not the seam that split but the fabric itself. what a waste of money.

as to the fit, it is a boxy cut through the waist. it looks better unbuttoned than buttoned. the jacket also shows a lot of the shirt you have under it, so it's good over something cute.

or, it would be, if it didn't fall apart.",0
I have been staring at these shorts since they first appeared and finally decided to treat myself to them for my birthday. when they came in the mail i was so excited and they in person are even more beautiful and well made then in the picture. but be warned these shorts are rather short so if you don't mind showing a bit of leg these will be right up your alley.,1
"This sweater is perfect for cool days.  the fit is true to size, though a bit longer than in the photos, especially the sleeves (i'm petite).  i actually liked the length so did not order petite.  the sweater is a relatively soft cotton blend.  it is comfortable and the ruffle adds just the right amount of finesse.  the ruffle is stitched on all the way, so it doesn't open in front, which is a plus.  the blue grey is marled and more grey than blue.  the red is beautiful and as pictured.",1
"Loved the look of this shirt online. i tried it on and was sad to see that the frontal view is all wrong. the cool shoulder design is almost too exaggerated (almost looks as if i'm ready for take off!). unfortunately, none of the featured photos on the product page display the frontal view of the model. i really wish the shoulder design was slightly smaller in shape and size - i would have loved it! looks great from the side but sadly i can't walk around like that ;)",0
"I love this brand, i literally live in their tops.. this one is a bit of a disappointment. it is made out of fabric that feels cheap, reminding me of a tissue tee instead of the normal thicker quality of all their other products. it's very thin, and see through. unless wearing a camisole/slip underneath, you have to have the perfect bra and pants situation going on underneath- no muffin tops or back fat!!i got the black, and am keeping it only because i love the design, need a black top desperat",0

"I truly feel guilty wearing these outdoors. it is incredibly comfortable, so much so that i asked the sales girl if these were pjs or actually worn out. i'm usually between a s and m. both fit fine, but i went with the m to have a bit more room and allow the top to be a bit more ""flannel"" flowy. the top has enough length that i can actually let it droop over the waist bet a bit. the length is definitely upper thigh on me (5'8"" @ 145), but rest assured, nothing is hanging out. it's actually the p",1
"I was excited to see this offered by retailer because i have been looking for a light blue summer jacket or blazer that isn't a denim jacket and this seemed to fit the bill. i've ordered several cartonnier blazers in 00p, as early as 2013 and as late as spring 2015, and have been very happy with them. on the plus side i would say that the color is depicted accurately and it does seem like a high quality jacket. but while the shoulders and sleeves were a pretty standard fit for 00p, it was much too",0

Maybe if i sized down to a small i'd like them better.. they look ok from the front. but it seems like the leg was cut way too wide. there is exceess material in the back and leg hole. they are not all flattering to my rear end. overall kind of shapeless and the fabric is prone too wrinkling. too expensive (with the added shipping fee for an online exclusive) for the lack of structure and simplicity.,0
"I love this sweater, it's so soft, and it seems to mold to my body more every time i wear it. it runs true to size, but i have noticed that as i wear it more and more, it seems to stretch a little. overall, i am very happy with it and would definitely recommend it!",1

"This top is very sweet and looks lovely on the model. it was not flattering for my larger bust, with the inverted pleat opening at my bustline and spreading out over my waist. the quality is nice, the fit in the shoulders is snug. the length is a bit short for me, but it may lay better on a different body type.",0
"I love everything about this dress. the coloring, fabric and flow of it. it's so much better in person than on-line. it's true to size and very comfortable. a great price as well.",1
My title says it all. this coat is sure to turn heads everywhere you go. the colors in the coat are beautiful jewel tones and differnt then you will see anywhere. it is so soft and warm and makes me feel fabulous. i feel it fits tts i am short and the regular lent was fine on me. get this before it's gone.,1
"Online this jacket is supposedly an online exclusive, but i saw it in green at my local store. i had to try it on and i loved it. it does swing but is not to much fabric. the drape is really nice it is shorter in the front and longer in the back. it sort of shows that on the model but is much more noticeable in person. this jacket is not lined and i would say more of a shirt. this is perfect for spring or cooler summer nights or over a tank or short sleeve in the winter. i also love lyocell it j",1
I can't believe how small these are. i almost wondered if the size was marked incorrectly. these are so pretty and such a shame because i love them. the rise in the crotch is also very short. very full in the legs and one is longer than the other:( the stripes don't line up in places which is also disappointing for this price!,0
"Ordered a petite and it was not as dark of a denim like the picture. the pockets on the backside are wide and are not flattering if you have any curve to your rear. makes you look wider than you are! pocket on front are also large, which accentuate thighs. these were returned immediately as it did not work for me.",0
"These pants are so perfect, i bought 3 pairs. perfect for casual friday's, a night out or the weekend.",1
"This top is very light and soft for summer. even the lace is soft. it's not sheer and doesn't require layering. true to size. i'm 5'4"", 34dd, 150 lbs- m fits well. my arms are not tiny and yet the lace weren't tight for me. but the quality of the material is average and it feels like it will last barely one summer. it's good if you are paying the sale price.",1
"This dress is seriously gorgeous, and even more so in person. the cut at the bottom is so flattering for curvy , pear shaped, and hourglass shaped women. i sized down so that the dress gave me more of a waist than you can see on the model and it was so much more flattering. love the fabric, fit and style of this dress.",1
"You do not want to know how many cropped, wide-leg jeans i've tried on. all the rest make me look ridiculous for various reasons....it's not easy to get this style right, apparently. these are great: comfy, make my legs look cute, not chopped off, they are not mysteriously tight in the upper thigh (why do some do that?) they act like trousers with a jean's casual edge. the ""let out"" hem is super cute and they are soft and comfortable. perfect with tucked in or shorter blouse styles.

i bought",1
"These pants are so great. i was debating between them and some sateen denim style pants from another store, but these definitely take the cake. the fit is awesome--although i am a 26 in the green and a 27 in the black, so that's kind of weird.",1
"Fun transitional dress for fall that can be worn with ballet flats, boots or booties. true to size. for reference i am 5'9, 138 with an athletic build.",1
"I wanted to love this dress but the sizing was too large for me, overwhelming my frame. i am very petite; for reference, 5'2, 24 waist, 30, and usually get an xxsp or 00p but even the 00p was too large in both the waist and especially in the shoulder area. at minimum for fit, i would have had to have the dress taken up but required too much alteration. the skirt is not lined which i found disappointing, given the price. the colors and handkerchief like hem is really cute though but i returned.",0
"I had mixed feelings about this dress. the material is lovely but the skirt is really odd. it has two slips, one that fits close and a second that's a bit too puffy. so the skirt didn't sit well and i thought it made my hips look bigger. the odd length made it unflattering. it might be nicer without the puffy slip but i didn't want to risk it.",0
"I am 5'7"", approx. 135 lbs, 27-28 in jeans, size 4 in dresses. purchased these in a size 8. i would suggest sizing up between one to two sizes. as a result, the upper thigh portion of the shorts do appear a little baggier - plus pleats - can be overwhelming in terms of material - but not so baggy that it would make it ""circus tent""-like. do not expect these to be fitted.definitely a fun pair of shorts. seems like it will go well with sandals, espadrilles, wedges. paired with either a front-tucke",1
"As with my other pilcro pants, i love the fit of these jeans. very soft fabric but don't stretch out too much after first wearing. the fabric is distressed but not so much that i worry about holes forming.",1
I loved these and wore them once (i bought the red ones) and the stained my furniture and my shirt so i washed them a few times in hopes of getting out all the extra dye- ruined yet another chair!!! so annoyed. i loved them but they are not worth it.,0
"The fabric quality and style are amazing. the fabric is very high quality and so soft and the style is nice for an adult. i generally don't wear shorts because of length, style and other problems but i can wear these without feeling like a high schooler. i usually wear a 24/00 in pants, i ordered the 0 and was worried that it would be too loose and look sloppy on me but it fits amazingly. one of my favorite purchases ever!!!",1
"This dress is cut perfectly to have a lot of movement. love the colors. i went with my usual size 2 and it fit generously. i am 5.4 and the size 2 hit about the same as the model. 

my only complaint: it came really wrinkled and will definitely not make a travel dress.",1
This top runs a little bit larger and if you have bat wings you might want to stay true to size. i haven't washed or dry cleaned yet although most retailer shirts i have come to find new to be dry cleaned. otherwise fit is great so is the overall aesthetic.,1
"These looked really interesting online and with the multicolor stripes i thought it would pair nicely with many tops. 

the fabric is nice and sturdy. the colors are more vibrant than online. 

the design however is terrible. when i put them on i double checked to make sure they weren't on backwards- the back is flat as a board but the front has these poofy pockets. the poor fit with the bright stripes gives a ""1920s circus diaper"" look which is not good. 

they're also really tight compar",0
"I adore eva franco but these are just not thoughtfully designed regarding fit. i wear a size 12 and took the risk of ordering the 12 as a popback, but they do fit 1-2 sizes small. i could get them zipped but it's not a good look. i feel like the waist would fit if the rise weren't so short. for reference, i have a 33"" waist and 42"" hips.",0
"I love this sweater's rich color and good quality, but the fabric is very thick and heavy, the neck opening is too wide, and the length is too short to be flattering not on my tall (not model skinny) frame.",0
"Tracy reese always pleases. this coat is absolutely awesome. it is gorgeous! the faux fur is soft and cozy. this coat is warm. i love the snap closure. this is the sort of attire that makes you feel lovely and is cheerful for those dull winter days. so happy to have in my wardrobe. a collector's item, for sure.",1
This dress is absolutely beautiful. i wear with with a flat shoes gold. i got a lot of complaints. i was witing the fall season finale antro bringing what i want.,1
"I'm in between a medium and a large and i ended up with a large because of the sleeves, which are fitted. the sleeve looks loose on the model, but i have some muscle on my bones. the v-neck is a little low and i will probably war a cami underneath, something i would have done in a medium as well. overall i like the top, i got the green. it has a nice style and will stand alone in warmer months without a jacket or sweater over it.",1
I just wore these for the first time and they are so comfortable. the mid rise waist is not too tight as many jeans are on me and the fitted hips keeps the wide leg crop cut from being frumpy. i wore them with sandals and i think they will wear well with booties and boots as the weather gets cooler too. they are a substantial weight jean not just for summer. these jeans will be seeing a lot of wear.,1
"I stopped into a store near me specifically to try these on given how adorable they look here. while i liked them, i didn't love them. i love some stretch, so that part was good. however, the denim was much thinner and lighter colored than they look to me online here. 


i really want to love them, though their light color has me less enthusiastic. another reviewer also mentioned a butt-flattening effect, which i noticed also. i might have sprung for them anyway, they do have a cute shape, bu",0
I was very excited to get this but very disappointed once it arrived. the fabric on the back is thin and clingy. i think you'd have to wear a slip underneath. cute design on the front but sadly it's going back.,0
"Overall, quite good red skirt, though a little clingy material. good that it has lining. the waist is elastic. xs fits great on me (5'4"", 120lbs).",1
"These are terribly unflattering the wash looks dirty and the rise is not 10.5 like the description says, which is the only reason i gambled on these it is 13"".",0
"I was really hoping that this dress would fit perfectly because it looks beautiful on the model! however, when i put the dress on, there is a seam where the top portion meets the bottom portion and it made the skirt stick out a ton. i ordered the 0p and i am 5'4"" 110lbs. maybe ordering this dress in a larger size would prevent the skirt from looking so full at the top.",0
"I'm not normally one to spend $89.99 on a dress from retailer, but when this dress arrived in the mail it was a no-brainer that i would keep it. it hangs beautifully on your body and the fabric is extremely comfortable the tie at the waist is really flattering and the neckline adds a little bit of fun. i imagine it can go from season to season pretty easily: springtime with a cardigan and flats --> summer with wedges --> fall with tights and boots. i love pieces that can serve different purposes a",1
I purchased this jumpsuit for christmas parties this year and have received so many compliments. it's a great fit and very comfortable. i especially love the pockets! very flattering.,1
"I honestly can't say enough wonderful things about this beautiful skirt. it is so soft and comfortable, very flowy and flattering, i have a smaller waist but wider hips, and this accentuates all of my best features! i highly recommend this skirt for any occasion! i wore it to my bridal shower and got soo many compliment and i really couldn't stop touching the material. what a wonderful addition to my closet!",1
"I bought this dress online because it looked interesting and on sale for $30 why not. i think it looks unassuming on the hanger but on it is fantastic. i am 5' 3"", 150 pounds, 34d and the 8 fit me perfectly. it accentuates the curves without revealing anything. will be perfect for fall/winter but am going to wear it to a wedding in june where the bride is a vintage loving person so i think with the right shoes and jewelry it will be perfect.",1
"The design is very flattering and holiday appropriate. but like many maeve dresses it is absurdly overpriced for the cheap materials used. although figure flattering, the zipper is so cheap that --it runs along the left side -- it bubbles out ruining the sleek look of the bodycon dress. and the rough cheap poly is not worth what they're asking for it. maybe find this on the sale rack but not at retail",0
"I loved the fabric design. the fabric itself is a bit strange to the touch. i'm hoping it will soften with time. and the smell from the fabric is a bit strange. however, i love the fit and cut and pattern. i will gently hand wash it and hope for the best.",1
"Got the wine color and love it! the design definitely is slimming! 5'1, 120lb, got  size 4.",1
"I wanted this dress in wine for a holiday party. but it just has no life whatsoever. unlike prior reviewer, i found nothing to dislike about the fabric. the fabric is fine and the fit is fine. i'm sometimes an 8 and sometimes a 6; took this in an 8 and definitely would not size down. it's relatively close- and well-fitting, but the sleeves and neckline further ruined it for me. the sleeves are shapeless, long and baggy. the neckline is just blah. it needs to be neater, trimmer, more cut. the ruc",0
"This is interesting material- very heavy and smooth. it is fits great, i was able to size down. the color is a brown/copper and should match most things. overall, it is a great skirt for colder weather since it is thick material.",1
I love this dress. the fabric is creative...checked lace. the silhouette is figure flattering. work appropriate and can wear it for dinner with a change of shoes and jewelry.,1
"Love, love, love this dress! the color is a beautiful blue grey, and the peach embroidery has just a tiny bit of sparkle. can be dressed up or down.",1
"It was a little shorter than i expected i am 5'8 and 125 pounds. i ordered the extra small and it was a perfect fit aside from length. at 42 yrs old, i can't wear mid thigh dresses to work. hit hit me at the same length it hit the model in the picture.... even though she is 5'10. if you are 5'6 and below this is a beautiful dress",1
"The fabric of this skirt is absolutely beautiful. however the fit, albeit unique, is not extremely flattering in my opinion. it may be because i am somewhat of a pear/hourglass shape rather than a more straight shape, but the fit is a little off imo. i am 5'8"" and 135# and ordered both the 6 & 8 and felt the 8 fit a little better.",1
"These are called jeans but they aren't exactly jean material. they are black with a nice stretch to the fabric. a bit tighter on the thighs than the flare jeans but the stretch to the fabric makes it work. i like these very much, a very slimming effect. mid rise- which looks very chic.highly recommend!",1
Love the perfectly placed ruching. the red lace over black and elegant. fits like a glove. gives me great curves,1
This beautiful blue sweater was exactly what i wanted!,1
"This dress worked well on me (not too curvy). it's fitted and enhances curves in a nice way. the patterns looked nice, too.",1
"I love this sweater, especially the sleeves. i'm 5'2 and athletic so i don't' feel that it is the most flattering for my figure but i love it so much that i kept it!",1
"I tried this dress on in the store. it looked frumpy. the ruching was not flattering. the fabric felt cheap. i think for the price there are plenty of other options for dresses than can give you a ""wow"" look. i'm 5'1"" 107lbs and the 0p fit fine.",0
"Cute, but very itchy! have to wear a long sleeve tee underneath!",0
"The color is nice and the material is what you might find used by a high school drama club with a low budget - a very cheap polyester. on top of that - it is unhemmed and unfinished in any way - so you can bet, that about the second or third wearing there are going to be runs all through the thing. i've attached a picture of the ""hem"" below. on top of that - the ruching is awkward (as mentioned by another reviewers). all in all - kind of terrible.",0
"Woah, these jeans looked ridiculous on me. i felt as though it was 1987 and i was raiding my mom's closet. the combination of the light wash, the crop leg and high waist with the odd stitching around the midsection make this a no. it really accentuates any pouch you may have. i was looking for a high waisted denim but these are very unflattering. i am 5'3"" / 140 curvy. no, no, no!",0
"I am 5'3"" and the arms of this sweater run at least 2 inches past my finger tips. if the arms were not quite so rediculously long then i would definitely keep it but unless you are tall, it just doesn't work. also, i felt the length of the waste was a little shorter than what is pictured online. sigh.",0
"This sweater is ok. i love, love, love bell sleeves so i thought for sure this would be perfect. i thought it would be a great sweater to transition from winter to spring, but once it arrived, i knew i had to return. the sleeves are not only bell but very long and the sweater fits chunky on your midsection. i like my sweaters more flowy. if you like fitted-style sweaters that are a bit roomy you would like this once. also, it's a bit itchy for me-but i'm rather sensitive and if i'd loved this on",0
"I love the style, but it didn't work for me. i ordered the r size. they were way too too long. i generally wear size 26, and the r length works with most retailer pants. with this particular pant, i could barely pull up the zipper. i'm not sure what happened bc i haven't gained any additional weight. i am 5'2, and 110 lbs. unfortunately, i had to return the pants. i think the design is for supermodels. maybe a petite size would have worked? the p was out of stock. good luck!",0
"I tried the size small on at my regular store, and thought the subtle, sophisticated color and the embroidered pattern were beautiful, though the dress was clearly too long for me in the shoulders, neckline and armholes, and the lower hem.

i ordered the small petite online, hoping that it would fit perfectly, but the top of the dress fit the same as the regular size had in the store. the only difference was that the bottom hem was a little shorter and a better length for me.

i bought the dress",1
"Love this dress! i've been looking for a nice nursing friendly dress for a while and this one is perfect! its so soft and hangs nicely. its very versatile and can be worn for multiple seasons. i ordered a size small which fits nicely, but could have done an xs or small petite. (for reference, i am 5'2"", 118 lbs).",1
It does run a little small. my regular 2 fit but snug. the colors were drab and the material felt like straw. the lining is really silky and nice. just didn't work for me .,0
"This skirt looked absolutely beautiful in store and took my breath away. i immediately headed to the fitting room to try it on, but was disappointed by the awkward ruching. if this skirt has removed that upper portion and kept a normal waistband (thereby also shortening it to knee length), it would have been lovely. it should be noted that this is midi-length, which is awkward on me. i was unable to find a cute way to wear this which is disappointing since it could have been lovely.",0
"I fell in love with this dress online, but it just doesn't look as nice in person. first of all, it's huge. i usually take a 4-6 in dresses. i ordered a size 4 in this, and it was like a sack on me. i would have needed at least two sizes smaller. however, after seeing it in person, i didn't love it enough to order a smaller size to get a better fit.",0
Super cute plaid top. i love the colors they are vibrant and go well with my fair complexion. it is a short top and would pair well with high waisted jeans or skirts.,1
"As with other maeve dresses, the fit is great. i love the empire waist with stud details. the slip is nice and stretchy and i really like the flowy chiffon look over a fitted slip. i'm not too keen on the way the sleeves tie and find that the ties get in the way of everything. when i first saw this online, i was super excited to find it in the stores because i loved the big orange snake that is on the back of the dress shown online. however, only the smallest size had the great snake on the back",1
"This jacket is really cute! however, the mesh is really fragile. i've had the jacket for a month and noticed a huge tear down the back shoulder. it doesn't fit me tight so i'm not sure how it happened. every time i wear it i'm super paranoid about snagging it on something. like i mentioned before, the jacket is cute. it's lightweight and the design is unique. but if you want to get more than an occasional wearing out of this then don't bother. i'm hoping i can return it otherwise that's a lot of",0
"This was the dress i was most excited about in the new arrivals, but sadly it didn't live up to expectations. unlike the first two product photos, the dress is baggy and empire waisted, and the black trim is the thin one shown in the last two product photos. the dress is slip on with no zipper or tie, and on me there were about 4+ inches to spare at the waist. all in all it felt sloppy, such a shame as i would have loved the original design online.

anyhow, i wanted to share photos of the real",0
This was a very odd fitting top. i should have read the description more closely. the colors are beautiful but the cut hit me in all the wrong places.,0
This top is lovely to look at and to wear... one to reach for frequently,1
This was really billowy but not in a good way. i had to return it. looks great in the photo but not so much in person.,0
Soft and romantic. i love it! just like pictured and i wear a cami under. dress up or down,1
Bought this shirt on-line. wanted to love it but just couldn't. i ordered the xs and it was huge and way too unstructured for my style....just didn't have enough shape. had to send it back.,0
"I'm so disappointed with the fit of this top. it is extremely short, even for my 5'2 frame. sizing up will not fix the length. too bad, because the shirt is cute.",0
"I love the look of this jacket. it's incredibly soft and fits tts. i love how it's a little different and fun. however, it's already pilling after 3 wears. probably have gotten a total of 15 hours of wear out of it. i am so disappointed. for this price point, i would have expected better quality.",0
"I love this shirt. tried in on in stores. i'm typically a medium across the board. i'm 5'6, 137lbs, 34d. i went for the size 6 figuring the 4 would be too small. the 6 fit... but it's short like everyone else said. not crop top short but definitely raise your arms and stomach is exposed short. i didn't buy it for the $50 price tag because of the shortness. but now that it's 30% i might spring for it, regardless of the weird cut. it's super cute otherwise!",1
"I disagree with the other reviews...the colors on this dress are great. bright against the black and the studs are super cute. and the ties at the cuff are a cute touch. fun dress. i think it's as fitted or not as you want. drives me crazy when people get hung up on their ""size"" to judge clothes. go up or down if it doesn't fit the way you want. i like it to flow a little so i sized accordingly.",1
These are way oversized! i have several pairs of pilcro jeans and these run way too large. wasted money on shipping. won't do that again:(,0
"I received this jacket in an 8. fits great with room . i am a 34dd chest for reference as i was not sure if i needed a 10, but the 8 is perfect. see my pictures as i feel the website photos are more bright as the actual jacket is more muted. buttons are very nice but the pocket flaps hit right at the boob area so it my bother some . very high quality, lined and will look great over some retailer dresses in the same color way i purchased last year. depending on the season this jacket would do fine",1
"Disappointing, back is yellowish and looks strange. the front view is cute but doesn't match the fabric on the back at all. can't imagine why you would do that?",0
"When i saw this blouse online i thought it was so cute! i love the floral detail. unfortunately it looks much cuter online than it does in person. it has no shape so it is not flattering to the figure. it might look better tucked in or partially tucked in as shown in the picture, but it did not look good completely tucked out. i was also not a fan of the fabric. in the picture the fabric looks dressier than it is. the front is more polyester and is a little dressier, but not what i envisioned. t",0
"Please be awate that although this blouse is beautiful and the color is gorgeous--it is completely sheer!!! it just doesn't match up with the price point,",0
The material is beautiful and high quality however the cut is so awful! it lays very weird near the neck and shoulder area. it kind of forms this square but if you are larger in the bust area it causes the top to slant making it lay awkward.,0
"I loved this dress on the hanger and loved it more when i tried it on. i am usually an 8, but purchased the 6 in this dress. i preferred the empire waist to be more fitted which the 6 provided. you can decide which look you prefer. both looked good. i just wanted a less baggy look. as one reviewer mentioned, the print is cut different on all of the dresses. i think the colors pictured online are accurate. regarding the snake on the fabric, i have several snakes on my dress, but not on the back a",1
"This is a very pretty, particularly youthful dress.  but, do be forewarned, it is gigantic.  size down even if you never do, and get a petite if you are even a little short.  i didn't size down enough and it was both wide and long -- it looked ridiculous.  i am petite, and the hem went way below my knees (and the dress was considerably longer than the slip).",1
I had my eye on this dress for months. i came into some extra cash and bought it at full price online and picked it up in the store. the purple pattern is nowhere near as soft as pictures. it was very bright which disappointed me. it's also made for more busty women. at a 34d i could in no way fill this dress out. the result made it look so frumpy and unflattering. i felt like an old lady in a bag.,0
"Bought this for a summer wedding, it fit great and i got a lot of compliments!",1
"I like the shirtsleeves for south florida and the material. the design is great too. hits high up on my waist which i like. i ordered the black, but had to send it back as the medium was too big. i usually take a medium, but the small fits perfect. like white a lot and ordered the gold too.",1
I love the style of this top. hand washed before wearing and it looks like a rag before i even got to wear it. very disappointed since i thought it would be a very practical tank.,0
"I so wanted to love the striped peplum top, however i have a petite frame with a large chest and there was absolutely no support in the top. not flattering in the least for a d-dd cup. will be returning. i imagine this would be perfect for someone with a frame like mary kate or ashley olsen :)",0
Love it!! it does run big so i had to return for smaller size. fabric is nice very true to picture,1
"I saw this online and ended up driving over an hour to pick it up from a neighboring retailer store that had 1 more left in my size! it fits true to size for me with the waist band fitting my 27"" inches perfectly with no real give- so keep that in mind. the top does seem a little blousey, which i typically avoid (34d already) but this was still super flattering. overall it is a gorgeous dress that looks good on- one of those dresses that makes you feel good wearing it!",1
I ordered this online and was completely underwhelmed in person. the pattern didn't pop at all and the fit was just ok. it kind of bunched weird in the breast area. i usually love plenty but this is a return.,0
"I ordered this dress online. the colors are pretty (if you like pastels) and the fit is true to size, however, it fits very much like a maternity dress. for those of you rocking a baby bump, this is a good choice. for others who are not, it's just not flattering. my figure got lost in the dress and the high waist did not look good on me. i returned it.",0
"I waited six weeks for this dress to arrive and was so disappointed. loved the skirt part of it. but the top, which i guess i didn't see in photo was pleated as well, made my bust look huge and it puffed out on sides. would have been a wonderful summer dress, flowing and cool.",0
There were just too many pleats to this thing. it was not flattering. it looks fantastic on this model but not on me. oh well.,0
"I love everything about this dress, but the bust area. the bottom is so light and flowey with the pleating. makes you want to twirl. the color is light but not as light as the photo. it does not wash me out. the problem is the bust. it has pleats that billow out near the armpit area, making you look top heavy. the bottom is slimming, the top make you look buxom. the v neck is also higher than i would like, which again adds to the fullness of the chest area. i am still debating keeping this or re",1
I love this dress! the colors are so pretty and the fit is very flattering.,1
"This wasn't for me. i have a short neck and am 5.3"". the length was fine on the one i tried on, but other proportions were off. it was too big around, in the middle, yet tighter at the bottom. on me, this made it resemble a large bag. the neckline stood up on mine. even when i pushed it down to resemble the picture here with the model, it still felt like a whiplash collar (coming up over my chin). i gave it four stars for quality since the material is so soft.",0
"I finally ordered this after looking at it many times, had to order the 00p as they were out of all other petite sizes, and to my surprise, it totally fits me! why i put larger. both colors are equally nice, but due to my pale skin (and only petite available) i ordered the ""yellow"" one (brighter colors). cut is flattering, love the pleat detail in the skirt, the 00p fit my 30dd chest, and 26.5 inch waist. the length is perfect, above the knee in front and lower in the back. good choice...",1
"This dress is absolutely gorgeous. the fabric is light and comfortable. the colors are even more vibrant in person. it has a keyhole opening in front, which might not be for everyone, but which i really liked. the only things i would caution buyers about, is that it is not lined, and for shorter buyers (i'm 5' 3"") it runs a bit long, so if you can pick up the petite, that might mean a better fit.",1
"This dress is easy to wear, lined and feels like it could be a wonderful summer staple. i love that it's so colorful. but for some reason, the pops of color on the white background did not look great on my very pale skin. i'm sure on someone else this will be beautiful. i also thought it ran just slightly large in the bust (although, to be fair, i am small-chested).",1
Just not cute. i don't know how else to describe this top. i am a 34dd and ordered a large. it fit and was comfortable but the peplum had way too much fabric it actually made me look much bigger than i am. i would possibly have tried a medium but it wasn't in store so i returned.,1
"This is a cute top. not perfectly made, a little boxy, but also not a crop top on me (5'5). it looks cute with high waisted jeans.",1
"I love the design of this top - short and swingy, with a cute mock turtleneck and interesting textured pattern. definitely runs large - if you're between sizes, definitely go for the smaller one. it also has pretty large armholes, so you can kind of see your bra from the side.",1
I was in love with this suit from the pictures. unfortunately the top is a little too short so the peplum skirt hits right at my widest part and doesn't meet the bikini bottoms.,0
"The product looked more or less as expected, but the fabric felt very cheap. not the quality i would expect from retailer. the shirt is also very short, which did not bother me but is something others should be aware of.",0
"I bought this top in black. it is high quality material and i love the mock neck and zipper in back.  however, not only are the armholes are too large, the shirt is cut too short. if i size down for smaller armholes, it becomes a crop top, not a flattering look for 50-something me. i really wanted this to work, but alas, it went back.",0
"It was just too big in the regular size and too short in petite.  the proportion was off.  i bought a similar sweater last year in a blue color that i wore constantly and was hoping this would be like it. i think if you are very tall you might pull this off. i'm 5,4"" and even the extra small regular hung below my booty.",0
"I had sized down because i'm usually a petite, but didn't have the option for petite here, and it was still too big. a petite or an additional size down could have helped the fit, but in the end the style wasn't what i was going for. the dress has a little more texture going on than what is revealed in the photo here on the site -- i thought it was a luxurious brocade fabric, but the shininess actually comes from silky threads on a mesh-ish overlay. it's a lovely, quality dress, and the color is",0
"I am a sweater girl, so i was really looking forward to this cozy-looking piece. like other reviewers, i found the fit to be very strange and not as pictured. i am 5'1"" and 107 lbs and typically wear xxsp or xsp. i ordered this in the xxsp because of the loose fit. it did not fit like the model at all. the sleeves were shorter and stuck out oddly. the length was not as long as pictured, but it would have been fine for me had the sweater not also been as wide as it was long. others suggested sizi",0
"The color and quality of this sweater are fantastic. the reason i only gave it two stars is that the height of the neck didn't seem right to me. it looked awkward and too high to be left standing upright, but when folded over i wished it were higher so it formed more of a turtleneck/cowl. i will be returning the sweater because of that.",0
"This is the 4th pair of ag stevie jeans i have bought from retailer. the petite sizing fit me great (i'm 5'1 and 112 lbs) the quality is fabulous and worth the price. i have 2 denim, 1 white, and just purchased these dark wave. i went to the ag store and they do not carry petities. this jean is made exclusively for retailer. love them!",1
"Just wanted to let readers know that the dress doesn't flare out at the bottom like it shows on the model. for me, that's a good thing. it definitely sways and swishes, but doesn't flare out. you definitely have to wear a slip with it, not because it's see-through at all (it's not), but because of the static. 

also, this is the perfect dress for belt-lovers.",1
"This dress is wonderful and the petite sizing is really for petites! (i have recently returned two dresses and a skirt that were way too large in the petite offering...so i was not really expecting this dress to fit so well!) i ordered in the 2p. i am 5'4"" about 120#. it fits beautifully...even though it's a tad bit loose in the arm openings and i think i could have sized down to the 0p (it is no longer available though). but this dress drapes so lovely and the material is so thin that there is",1
"Very versatile tank.....i will wear it with slacks, skirts, culottes, jeans. it is soft; and the pattern is more noticeable than in the picture. i ordered the white; and i may order the black too. i am 5'4'', 130 lbs. ordered in small. the armholes are perfect - no gap at all.",1
This dress is to die for.  the picture doesn't do it justice. so pretty and dainty.  perfect dress for a wedding.,1
"I loved everything about this shirt except the harm holes are oddly large. i tried on a medium and the arm holes were very large so i thought a small would fit better but it didn't, the fabric is beautiful and the diamond pattern looks amazing up close but i decided to return the top because the arm holes just stuck out so awkwardly.",0
"The fabric and cut of the dress is beautiful.  i am writing a review so i can share my experience regarding size. i ordered the dress in size 2, my normal size for this designer. it fit ok but was a little large in the bust area. for reference, i am a 34 a. i i returned it and ordered a size 0, which fits perfectly.",1
"I love, love, love this top! the color is beautiful, a pinkish-orange, about exactly how it looks online. it is soft and light weight for summers. it does run a little big, i debated between a 0 and a 2 and ended up with a 2, i'm almost 5'7"" and 130lbs for reference. it wings out on the sides at first, once i steamed it at home and relaxed the fabric a bit it draped nicely, so don't let that turn you off from it when trying it on! part of the design is cut out through out as a warning,",1
"Beautiful top marred only by the armholes. i tried a small and a medium but alas, my bra showed under the arms. i my be overly endowed for this top, but the way it cuts, you would have to be braless to wear it. not for me, but wish it worked. it is really pretty.",1
"I see other reviewers are like me. we are wondering why antho has so many waistless, big, flowy tops! please! more tops with a defined waist! please!
i love this top. it's a gorgeous color and a lot of work to it, very retro antho, not just a t-shirt like so many are these days. to my delight, it runs large. i usually wear a 14 or 16, but the store had a 12 in the sale room, and not only did it fit, but i plan to have my seamstress taper the waistline and cut off the ""wings"" that flare off on t",1

"Very poorly made- wide and short, very unflattering. the material is advertised as cotton, but it felt very synthetic.",0
"This dress is very pretty colorwise, but the fit did not work for me. i could see this working on girls with narrow hips, but it didn't flatter my narrow waist/wide hip frame.",0
"I wanted to love this so much that i ordered in both a mp and sp. both have gone back. i'm petite and curvy - particularly on top. i wear petites 90% of the time. this didn't fit like a petite - it was cut like full size in every way - particularly the arm holes and length. when the mp didn't fit (i always start trying on in the larger size), i thought - well surely the small will be better. i considered keeping because i would wear it with jackets over it, then decided that was crazy. disappoin",0
"Thought i would love this product, but i had to return it. the fabric and design were very nice but the length was very short and the neck too tight. i ordered a xxsp which is usually the size i get. if i had known i would have ordered a regular xxs. not sure if this would have solved the problem. might be worth going to the store to try.",1
"Great job from the fabricators in creating such a gorgeous print on light-as-air silk! i'm so happy with the dress and can stare at it for hours, that's how pretty it is. the fit is perfect on me and disguised my figure flaws since it's an a-line skirt that doesn't cling. yes, the skirt is sheer and unlined and for the price a slip should have been included. fortunately i own a silky half slip that complements nicely. i'm a top heavy 36dd, large rib cage, 140# with a square waist and no hips and",1
"I love this top so much that i ordered it in second color. it is shorter but still works with skirts and pants. the material is a fun texture. i didn't have any problems with the arm holes, but this may be due to being less full in the bust area.",1
"Love this sweater! i purchased both the green and gray versions and will wear them constantly this winter. although some reviews were critical of the feel of the yarn, i do not find this to be a problem... so happy with these products! for reference to size, i bought the m and am 5'11... the sweater hits me exactly where it does on the model.",1
"This dress has a marilyn feel to it, felt like a dream",1
"This dress is much prettier in person! colors are more vibrant and don't need to iron!!! the neckline was too low for me, so wore a light purple cami underneath which matched the purplish shade of the dress! perfect!!!",1
This is a lovely dress that i would consider to purchase if the dress is lined and the key hole is not deep. tts,1
I'm a slightly pear shaped girl. a c chest with size 14 hips. the dress fit great around my waist and would have been perfect except the space in the chest area was too big. it looked odd on me with all the extra fluff in the chest. fabric is nice and flowy. the dress is lined.,1
"I wasn't sure what to expect when i ordered this but when it arrived i was pleasantly surprised that it's by postmark and has an interesting cut. i ordered the xl in the hope that it would be oversized and slouchy. it is that and more! the lightweight, sweater like material is truly perfect for the transition to spring. i look forward to wearing it tomorrow!",1
"My local retailer had one of these skirts in store, presumably a return. i was so excited when i found out that it was in my size! i'm 5'7 and usually a 2 or 4 at retailer and bought the 2 for reference. the skirt is made of a heavy fabric and the pockets are lined with paisley fabric! the seams look really sturdy and the skirt moves well. it's very cute and super easy to wear. i styled it with brown boots, an retailer belt and a white button down. great for spring/summer xx",1
"These are great, casual, comfy pants for summer. i'm 5'1"", 95lbs, usually a 25 or 26 in pants. the reg 25 was a better fit than the 26p.",1
Love this tunic. very comfortable and a perfect length to the knee. i wore it to a birthday party with brown booties. the green moss color is perfect for the fall in new england. can't wait to wear it again.,1
Better than the picture - i like the layered look and the texture of the fabric. great top.,1
"This really was nothing special. for $68 there are much cuter tops at retailer. it wasn't particularly flattering as it was very boxy, so it added volume. it was soft and felt like decent quality which was nice. i agree with another reviewer that the ruffles feel too big. overall, this was just a miss for me.",1
I love these tights!! they're thick and durable and the pattern is super cute.,1
Unfortunately this one is going back. the fit is very flattering and the underlying layer is very revealing in the back.,0
"I got both colors as i'm not sure when a style that is so perfect for me will come around again. these are beautifully designed and very slimming. they are described as crops but i am 5'5"" tall and the length is perfect, approximately 1/2 above the heel of my shoe. no alterations required!!! usually retailer pants are extremely long for me but these citizens of humanity cords are the perfect length. the colors are just as pictured-i was surprised by another review that described the navy as",1
"I love the coh fleetwood jeans, and since i was looking for a pair of not-so-skinny skinny jeans, i thought these would be great. but unlike the fleetwoods, which are a substantial weight denim, these are very soft -- too soft -- and bag out in the first 5 minutes. the style is okay but the fabric makes them unflattering. maybe if you're looking for jeans you can lounge in, these will be for you because they do have the comfort equivalent of sweats.",0
Looks great on the photo and from previous reviews i decided to give it a try. the material seems cheap and stiff. would not fit my frame well.,0
"The concept of this top is cool and the outer fabric is nice. the inner layer is sheer but as long as you're wearing a nude-colored bra, no big deal. however i did find the inner layer to be scratchy. they must've photoshopped the fit of the top on the model or altered the top, because it looks like it hangs straight on her. i ordered an xs and when you pull it out of the package, it clearly flares out & is a-line. so as a previous reviewer stated, it looks huge from the front. if it had fit the",0
"Dear retailer & designers:
just want a nice dress that isn't made from polyester! don't mind paying bigger bucks for quality fabrics, but please- enough of the polyester!

your customers",0
"I bought the xs regular and it was a little too long and wide. i was unable to find a petite version in the store or online. the ruffles were also bigger than how they appear on the model. i am 5'1"" tall and weigh 110 lbs. i believe the petite would have been a much better fit. i regret not discovering this top sooner when more size options were available.",1
"This top is really cute online, but that's about it.  it runs large, but even if i sized down the ruffles were a bit much and the top was a little boxy surprisingly.",0
"These are the best trousers i have bought in a long time! i'm 5'8 and 145 pounds and the 8 fit with a bit of extra room in the waist--not enough to size down. i love that they are not ""skinny""--so over the skinny fit. i plan to wear these with black heels, white tee, and the vegan black leather jacket i purchased at the same time--oh, and a statement necklace--always a statement necklace. these are a must for every fall wardrobe! more pants like these, please!",1
The sweater material was fragile. there were already two picks in the fabric when it arrived. i felt like it would not wear or wash well. i was also disappointed in the shaping or how it hung on my body. i am returning the sweater.,0
"I don't know what the problem with this sweater was on me but it just didn't work. it was too wide across the breastline, i think, creating a boxy shape that just didn't look flattering. outside of that, the sweater was lightweight and seemed well made. i was sad to send it back, especially at the sale price.",1
"These are the perfect light weight relaxing summer pants!
the fabric is soft and light, and has some stretch, so i think they can be worn more fitted way, too. 
i don't want to show off my bottom half of my body shape, so these are perfect ones to be a bit loose to covers the silhouette but still looks feminine & not too loose. 
i''m 5'3, 115 lb and usually wear 25-26 jeans, 25 petite gave me the perfect relaxed look without losing the feminine look. i think 24 could fit as well, but would sn",1
Prettier in person! so pretty! i'm 5' 6'' 120 lbs and the xxs fit well. i normally wear a 0-2.,1
I was very disappointed in the quality of this top. the first time i wore it it snagged right in the front. i had to pull the thread under so it wasn't exposed. i put it in the wash in the gentle cycle and it was destroyed with several more snags when i removed it from the machine. this top is extremely delicate and doesn't withstand normal everyday casual wear although it's s casual lightweight sweater. now it's just a wear around the house ratty throw around shirt.,0
Saw this top online and knew i had to have it! it's unique and gorgeous with the split back and two-layer design. the top layer is thicker and almost like a brocade/tapestry design with rich purple and yellow tones. the under layer is sheer and lightweight. i was able to wear this early in my pregnancy and it totally disguised any bump i had from co-workers. this is def one of my top 10 fav tops now!,1
"In the photo and from far away this top looks more elegant than it truly is. wearing it feels like something better suited for sleeping in. it's a sweatshirt with the sleeves torn off and raw edges, which looks rather cheap and sloppy.",0
I wanted to love this top. it was huge and i didn't like the material. it felt like it should have been much less expensive than it was.,0
"I just received these jeans today after buying them online last week. i wasn't sure how they would fit, but i am so very happy i got them. and on sale too!! i am 5'2"" and about 128 pounds. athletic and curvy but petite too. i bought the size 4 and they are a perfect fit in the length too. they are button up, boyfriend style but not too baggy. the detail on the cuff is perfect and they have a unique, unusual but expensive look. what a steal !! i would have paid full price for jeans that fit this",1
"This top has gorgeous embroidery, very very nice, looks good in both wine and grey. it runs large. i kept it around not sure whether i should keep it. i usually wear xl, i ordered l and it still was loose at the bottom but fitted at the top. i have a big bust, and the embroidery ended at the top of my bust making the entire look unflattering, because the bust juts out in a strange way below the embroidery. the arms also tend to look wider due to the style. i don't like the fit at all.",1
"I have now purchased these pants (online) three times in the ivory. i first ordered them in a 28 as it was the only size available, and i thought that size would fit me in this brand. wrong! i was swimming in them. great pants, but too large in the waist. i kept checking online and they popped back in a 27, which i thought would fit. wrong again! they arrived a couple of days ago, and still they are too large in the waist, but since 27 was the only size available, i thought that i would keep the",1
Purchased to speak at an event. not only is it very eye catching and i garnered many compliments it fit like it was made for me and was comfortable to wear. i questioned ordering a 4 and possibly could have worn a 6 but with the elasticity to the material there was no problem with movement or sitting and i felt hugged in in all the right places!,1
"Remarkable dress, so much so that people stop me to remark about it!",1
"This dress is a beautiful, classic dress that is figure flattering and as stunning in person as it is in the photo. i love it!!!",1
"Love this dress. sexy but still appropriate. very elegant. i'm 5'6, 125 pounds, and the size 2 fit me great. it is a little long so i am considering ordering the size 2 petite. definitely worth the money.",1
"This gorgeous dress arrived today and i can't wait to wear it. based on other reviews i ordered a 6 petite even though i'm 5'6"" because i wanted the skirt to hit just above my knee. it's perfect. i usually wear a 4 or 6 and the 6p fits well, not snug but not big either. maybe a 6r would be larger, i don't know. if you are worried about the skirt being too long then definitely try a petite size. 

the dress is risquã© because it's faux ""see through"" but still very classy and elegant. it's sexy w",1
"I had high hopes after reading all of the reviews, but as you can see, the dress didn't live up to them. i ordered a size 8, and maybe a 6 would've fit better, but i'm not going to find out. the sheer area on the model really stands out; it does not in real life. there were loose threads throughout, and there really shouldn't be at this price point. i was going to wear this to a wedding, but as a member of the wedding party, i don't think it would picture well at all. i'm sorry that it's headed",0
"Very cute summer dress. it runs a bit large and it doesn't give you shape. but, it's good for me to hide my belly fat. the dress is so comfortable to wear. i didn't know that it has pockets, so that was a pleasant surprise (i always love pockets). overall, it's a perfect summer dress.",1
This is my 4th byron lars dress and i just love this designer. his dresses all fit the same as far as i can tell. i had bought this dress as my sister in law recommended it so much and she was right it is stunning!,1
"I've been looking for white beach shorts and these are perfect! as another reviewer said, they are in fact see-through -- because they are meant to be a cover up, not ""real"" shorts. the hem detail is very cute and they're super comfortable! my size small fit tts, and the 3"" hem is nice for tall women.",1
I love this dress! it's very cute and comfortable. i belted it to give me more of a waistline because otherwise the tented shape overwhelms my short stature. i love the strap design at the neckline. the off the shoulder sleeves are comfortable. i have an xsp which is true to size for me.,1
"This dress has been on retailer's site for a while now (years?) and i finally grabbed one during a recent member sale. i can't believe i waited so long! it's so gorgeous on - classy but still distinctly sexy. i'm 5'10"" 160# and the size 8 fits great - definitely fitted through the hips and thighs and roomy enough on top i considered taking it in. beautiful dress overall!",1
"I am so happy with this! i was pleasantly surprised upon receiving it as i expected it to be of lesser quality than what i found it to be. it is a medium weight weave, grey sweater with a beautiful design and texture; one of those pieces that you will tire of long before it wears out! it is a great layering piece but not over bulky or structured tops as it is very smooth fitting without a whole lot of give. that is to say it is not loosely woven so it is better over a snug fitting item. the colo",1
This dress is really lovely. it looks so fragile online but in person is rather structured and substantial. it runs very large i just returned mine for 2 sizes down. i also like the zipper up the back so that the eye hooks on the front are not necessary to use to put on. the interior lining is affixed so there is no slipping like a typical under slip. if you are on the fence at least try it. i am glad i did.,1
Love this dress. the fit is amazing. i wore it to church for my brother's wedding and got so many compliments. it looks great in photos too!,1
"I would not have spent this much on a dress without a gift card, but it absolutely lives up to the hype.",1
"I disagree with reviewers who said the dress looked cheap, cavernous or stiff. quite the opposite. i wore this to my 32nd anniversary dinner, and two women stopped me to say i was stunning. i am an average medium hourglass. the dress arrived in 2 weeks and was true to size. i wore a nude lace strapless bra underneath. the hem reaches the bottom of my kneecaps. the lace sleeves were not tight on my fleshy arms. the neckline lays flat. the dress zips in back, and the silver hooks in front are most",1
"Fabulous dress!
clip off the tags because they show through the lace on the back (you can see this on the back photo of one recent reviewer).",1
"I love this dress and am strongly considering buying the white, too, but i wish it came in another color other than white or black, because i would get that. goes great for nice dinners, dates, weddings, almost anything. it's not ball-gown fancy, but just fitted and nice enough to wear for work or a nice evening out. only problem i have are with the clips in the front. i have a hard time using the loo because it is very fitted, you have to un clip them and then re-clip, but it's worth the effort",1
I so wanted to love this but was underwhelmed - ii am tall but yet it hit below my knee in that awkward spot that is just a tad too long to be hip stylish and too short to be evening cocktail - just felt / looked frumpy ... i do think it looks great on other reviewers though so may just be that if wasn't a good fit for my body type - i wore my normal size 6 and it just didn't flatter - made me feel 10 years older,0
"I am obsessed with denim and have two other pairs of ag jeans from retailer that i am very happy with. my recent preference has been for high-rise skinny jeans and decided to give these a try because of the versatile medium wash. when i tried these on in my normal size, they were so cute that i bought them full-priced. i could tell that the material was pretty stretchy (which is what makes them soft and comfortable), but was not expecting them to stretch out and sag after a few hours. by th",0

"This is a gorgeous sweater but huge. and when i say huge, i mean gigantic. i'm usually a size large and i don't even think the small would be small enough. the cowl neck and fabric overall is great (although stretches out, which is why it becomes so overwhelming) but the sweater just hung on me like a short blanket. the armholes are very big - deceiving on the model. returning.",0
"Bought this dress for a friend's wedding. i have since worn it to two others and the opera numerous times. it's my favorite little black dress as it's sexy and modest at the same time. i receive numerous compliments every time i wear it! it's easy to get into, the zipper is sturdy and the fabric is breathable, stretchy but not clingy.",1
"I really liked the casual style of this top, but i was disappointed when i put it on.  it's cut weird- the shoulder cut-outs are smaller than pictured and just don't seem to hang right.  they don't hit where they're supposed to and the sleeves were also not as pictured, more like 3/4 which i didn't like.  the color is really nice and i liked the fabric but the fit was just off.  i tried xs and s.  both fit weird.",0
Too small... too flare... nice thick fabric. not my favorite pant.,0
"This is a really cute sweater. it's thick enough to keep you warm, but it just didn't look right on me. it made me look frumpy.",1
"The fit is gorgeous, but i didn't realize it was completely transparent. when it says ""mesh"" it means ""mesh""! i was thinking the ""mesh"" part was on the bottom. because of how it is cut, high on the shoulders, you can't wear a cami underneath to provide coverage. very cute, but not practical.",0
"I typically wear a medium, but went with a large because i am pregnant and tall. i think i could have used the medium in width, but like the length of the large. it is a wider fit and is significantly shorter in the front than the back, but i think works with the look of the top. i think you could dress it up or down and the fabric is cozy. i would highlight that it has a wider fit, but i think that is the design of the top. overall, i am pleased and i think meets my search for an off the should",1
"I really like these but my usual size 29 did not fit. i always wear that size in pilcro but these were at least a size two small and i have to return them. regretfully, they are out of size 30 so i lose out. wish there had been previous reviews to let me know, so i'm doing so now for anyone thinking of ordering.",1
"I was really disappointed with these pants. they were a thinner fabric than expected with little to no stretch. they were very tight around my legs and huge at the waist. sadly, they will be going back.",0
"The color and the fabric in these shorts is quite nice as is the length. i didn't order the pilcro bermudas because another reviewer said the legs were quite wide. unfortunately, these shorts also have wide legs. i'm going to have them tailored so they hug the legs as in the picture rather than billowing out. i do not have skinny thighs(don't i wish!) and i was surprised that the fit was not as pictured. if you're ok with wide legs or can get them at a price at which you're ok spending extra for",1

I wore out a pair of level 99 shorts a couple of years ago. ordered these in the same size and they are huge. so i am sending them in for exchange and hope i'm guessing right. linen and tencel are my two favorite summer fabrics. love the length which can be adjusted by rolling. good pockets. gorgeous somewhat dusty plum color. belt loops if needed though i rather hope they're not.,1
"The other reviews seemed promising and so i ordered these in a 10 petite. i am 5'4"" and the length was still long and would either need to be worn with a heel or altered. the length was not what made me send them back though. the quality is very very nice and the fabric thick, stretchy and well made. however, the body hugging fit and flare make these look exactly like a yoga pant but made from nice material. if i were a bit more confident to wear these outside of the gym then they would be great",0
Not sure why it has gotten good ratings and or why sold out online periodically. awkward fit and flares quit a bit at waist. also has extra material at waist line so does not look flattering.,0
"This sweater is a hit. the color is fantastic and the shoulder cutouts add a feminine and unique touch. looks amazing paired with booties, a statement necklace and jeans. definitely affordable too! highly recommend",1
I loke the idea of this jacket but it was executed poorly. it makes me look like a football player! i am 5'8 135/athletic build and i was swimming in the m. i tried a small on in store and it still looked like i was wearing shoulder pads. it hangs and gaps awkwardly. the sleeves are freakishly long and the overall length was too short.,0
"These are beautiful pants! the wine color is rich and they are very soft. they just run really small. i normally wear a 25 regular but often i have to roll the length up a bit. so, this time i ordered a 25p thinking it would be the same just shorter -- but i could hardly even pull them over my slinder size 6 foot. i am going to exchange them for a 26 regular. i so hope that they fit -- they are so lovely!!

Cute blouse & great price !!,1
Really great best.  nice substantial material and great fit.  will be able to wear with many things.,1
Loved this shirt but it runs pretty big. i'm normally a sm/med due to bust size (34ddd) and ordered a small based on other reviews. could have gotten an x-small. debating going to exchange. i ordered it in three colors bc it was on sale. better quality than some at retailer.,1
"These run at least 2 sizes smaller than other styles of the same brand, mother. such a bummer because the quality is totally on point. i'm going to exchange them for a huge size i guess. whatever, i don't mind having a size that's so much larger than all my other jeans. i just mind the complete hassle of the exchange process. i wish mother would get their sizing issues under control. it's not retailer's fault. so annoyed.",0

(i am just over 5 feet tall, 106 lbs, with long legs for my height, and the 25 fits really well.) they wash and dry well, with minimal (if any) shrinkage, as long as you use low temperatures. i gave them 4 stars, instead of 5, because i feel the material could be more substantial than it is. the green is actually a very attractive mossy brown.",1
This shirt is amazing. i bought it in white and found i was wearing it with everything...so i went back to get the gold (which is yellow). the dit runs big so order a size down. love the riffle around the sleeve and the little dot trim. very cute!,1
"I got this dress in the mail, and while i loved the concept of it, it really is too boxy. the tie is very superficial and does not really nip you in at the waist, it is more so for show. it is fully lined which was interesting, and to me, made the dress seem boxier. the quality is good, but i am an hourglass and this was completely unflattering. i would have had to size up to make it look like the model shot, but it would have still been a shapeless dress, just bigger. it does fit true to size,",0
I love this pajama combo! it is super cute and comfortable!,1
"Pretty top, i like the flutter sleeve design.  the linen is thin- too sheer to not wear a cami underneath the white.  nice for the sale price.  can easily be dressed up or down.",1
"This little pantie is fun and playful. its a deep maroon color with small shimmering lace details. the back is sheer but the front is more filled in and opaque. the ribbons on the sides can actually be untied which is a big plus for me. i'm a small lass, but i have a big bum so i got a medium and it fits perfectly.",1
I found this dress to be shapeless on (even when the belt was tied). i love the tshirt material and the fact it has short sleeves. it's just too boxy.,0
"The fabric and cut of this blouse are beautiful, but the v was so deep i could never wear it without a cami and i think that would ruin the look. i have a large chest, but the similarly cut blouse (without the textured fabric - from the same designer) fit me fine. this one is just cut differently. i even tried sizing up and down - to no avail. the photo on the model seems misleading because i don't see how the neck would lay flat or stay that high on anyone - even with a smaller chest. i was so",0
Unfortunately had to return this. i loved it but just doesn't work for my petite size.,1
"I really like the idea behind this top, but at least for me, the execution wasn't quite there. i was hoping it would be something i could wear to work, but the sheerness of the sides makes it in appropriate for my workplace (when it gaps/you move, you can see a lot). if you don't move, the front panel is pretty opaque, which is good. i think it would look odd with a cami underneath and i don't feel comfortable with the sheerness, so i returned it. i also thought the finish on the sleeves looked",0
It is a very pretty skirt but arrived extremely wrinkled and the waist is very fitted. overall i probably would not have purchased it if i had actually seen it in the store.,1
Love this dress! wore it last night for a musical event... came home and put it on the hand wash setting in the washer with cold water...just as the label states. pulled the dress out and guess what? the design is completely faded!!! it looks 5 years old :( so sad. i'm going to call retailer and ask for a refund (i live two hours away),0
"While the print is cute, the fit is a disaster if you are a c cup or fuller. the bottom band does not lay flat as pictured on the model (it rides up under your boobs) and the whole cup area tips forward - it's not really molded like a bra, more flat foam insert. immediately went back. hopefully, if retailer continues to do swimwear, they'll take a look at adjusting the designs to make sure they're also workable for fuller cup sizes (underwire please!)",0
"I tried this in the fish print and the pallas stripe. i did not like the fit of the fish print, but the stripe is perfect--so try more than one color if you are interested in this style. also try more than one size of course. i almost always order up in a swimsuit, and this time was no different. the medium fit great, although i am a xs-s according to the size guide. i am a 34b for reference, but i think my rib cage is somewhat wide. i do not like to feel constricted, but i still want the top to",1
There is nothing special about this skirt. it's plain and incredibly dowdy looking. long and wide. i am usually between a small and medium. after reading the other review that said the waist ran small i went with a medium. it fit fine in the waist/hips.,0
"Great cut and fit. tts. size 6 fit my 5'5"", 135 pound frame (34b/c bust) wonderfully. my sister and best friend loved it on. but i'm returning. the color is more of a very bright orange than red. i would want to wear this in the middle of summer but the all-polyester fabric is hot. i have too many dresses in my closet. cute as it is, i'd just never pick this one. love to see this design in lighter fabric and different color options. 1-2"" longer would also be a slightly better length.",0
Very flattering and flowy dress. would pair this dress with cowboy boots or navy wedges.,1
"This is my favorite shirt ever. i've had it for years and it still looks great. please, please bring it back!!",1
"This sweater is just the cutest- sweet and feminine with interesting details especially in the back. it's very figure flattering worn closed (there are 3 adorable little buttons) or it can be worn open over a dress or a cami.
it runs very small, i usually wear a small or extra small but i bought this one in a medium, mindful of the reviews. i'm so glad i did since in addition to running small the sweater did shrink a little when i washed it even though i hand washed it in cold water. it wasn't a",1
"This sweater was not as featured in the picture. the front is completely cropped while the back is regular length. the front barely reached the middle of my stomach. also, the color was not as vibrant as shown in the picture. this sweater will be going back.",0
"Super cute in raspberry and very flattering! i paired it with the reversible tank in dark gray, skinny jeans and fringe boots.",1
"This romper is so flattering. i normally don't like how short rompers are, but this fits and flares at the perfect spots on me. not to mention that it's super comfortable. i wore it last weekend and got a ton of complements. very happy i bought it! i normally wear a medium, but the small fit me perfectly?i'd recommend sizing down.",1
"This is just adorable on. i go between a small and medium and the small was perfect for me.. i wore this with tights and boots, but can also see this working in warmer weather with sandals or peep-toe booties.",1
Can't say about fit just yet since it is a gift; color is soft green and versatile. finishing touches around edges and in back make it a stand out sweater that dresses up jeans but also nice over a dress or with skirt,1
Seemed pretty shapeless which surprised me because of the design. perhaps it was just too big. returned it.,0
"I was at first a bit leery of this dress because of the shape. baggy is in, but it's not always flattering. i am usually a big small-medium and the medium was too fluffy. i realize it's supposed to be loose, but not that loose. i'm 5'8"" and 146 lbs and the small was the best option. perfect amount of looseness but still gave a hint of shape. it has pockets and is so comfortable. i'm a school teacher so i try to find clothes that i can wear in both worlds. this is definitely a keeper! i will for",1
"The colors and design of this skirt are beautiful. the fabric hangs nicely. the color i more burnt orange than red. i ordered my usual size (6), but it is too small.",1
"This sweater has every special element i could want .... form fitting, feminine, and attention to detail. i ordered it in turquoise, which is a lovely muted turquoise that works well when dressed up or down with a cream cami. because i am petite, the fitted waist detail in back hits me just in the right spot. thank you, retailer, for another timeless addition to my collection of yours.",1
"I wanted to love this sweater and it has some nice distinctive features that make it more interesting than your average cardigan. unfortunately, however, i found that flared in an unflattering manner over my stomach. the chest fit well - though it was very low cut - but then if i buttoned the sweater it made me look like at least three sizes larger.

the quality seemed okay, but a bit thin and i was afraid that this would not hold up for long.",0
This dress is absolutely hideous on my physique. ordered a size 6 and it hung on me like a cheaply made tent. i have an athletic built am a 34d. it is going back asap.,0
"I think these jeans are much better in person than on the picture. on the model they look a bit boxy and too loose for my taste. i am tall, slim/athletic and they fit like made for me in my usual size. they have some ""give"" and tend to get looser while you wear them, but because they are midrise they won't slide down. they are a slightly relaxed swlim fit on me. the demin is solid, the color a nice medium dark sky blue. the emobroidery and the beads are beautiful and look like they will hold up",1
"These jeans are fantastic! i've worn them once and got many compliments. definitely keepers. i am 5'8"" and weigh about 135. normally i wear a 29 but i sized down based on reviews to a 28. they fit perfectly at the start of the day, but as all jeans with a bit of stretch do, they get bigger as the day goes on, but because they're a boyfriend cut it all works. really happy with this purchase. my only regret is that i didn't get two pair.",1
"I bought this dress for spring/early summer thinking it was light and airy but the fabric is too heavy. because the color is dark (even with the flecks of peach), combined with the heavy fabric, it's too much for spring. this dress is perfect for early fall weather. the dress fits fabulous and very flattering. i love the side pockets. it hits all the right places. i'm hourglass shaped, full figured. i normally wear size 14/16 and i bought this dress in lg. again, it fits great, but too heavy for",1
I've been craving this dress in the brown pattern for a while and should have jumped the gun before the sale. so now i was left with size sp and i look like a fool--like i'm trying to wear a top from junior high and pass it off as a dress. my shoulders,1
"Well...this is ""on me"" as i saw this hanging in the store, but way off on my size which is xxs petite.

i looked too quickly and got a nice sa to order it for me.

both pieces are transparent - no opaque lining at all is inside. both pieces are made of fragile clingy materials. there is no ""flow,"" just cling. the size is much too big so the resulting look is of two bad pieces hanging oddly without any real shape.

this may be the first time i really just not recommend a piece - at all. bes",0
Better than a regular boring cardigan. goes with short sleeves and dresses!!,1
"This top is beautiful - even more so in person. however, like a previous reviewer, the fit is very boxy. there is so much excess fabric that poofs out on the sides that you can't see in the photos due to the model's cardigan and arms. if this top had been a bit longer and more fitted, without all the excess fabric at the bottom, it would have been perfect. again, the color, the lace, the fabric and the pleating is all gorgeous. would love it if the designer took this into consideration and came",0
"I am a large in knit tees. this is the first tee where the large was just too big. it kind of hung on me. the band across the back also hung down so all over it looked like it was just too big a size for me. the army green turned out to be not a flattering shade of green for me so i returned it. i liked the whole design a lot, especially the front macrame part, but for me it did not work at all. also, too expensive for a tee.",0
A sales associate handed these to me while i was trying other things on. i had never tried the hoxton before. i have found my perfect black jean! they are so comfortable and they don't stretch out like others i have tried.  i am 5'4 and i roll them a few times but i like that look. i am usually a 25 and that is what i took in these.,1
"This nightgown looked so comfy and cute! i ordered a large and it was so uncomfortably tight.i'm 5'3"" and 150lbs. it was such a shame. size large should not just be really a medium!",0
"Paige denim has done it again with this version of the hoxton high rise. no matter how many times i tell myself that i will find a less expensive pair of jeans, i never can find jeans that fit as well and last as long as my paige jeans. this is a sleek pair of skinny jeans with the added benefit of being high waisted. as a mom who hates always having to worry about spilling over the top of my jeans (no matter how thin or fit you are, i'm sorry ladies, this problem is real!), the hoxton high rise",1
"Very comfortable, feels like you're wearing pjs while being dressed up. fits true to size. very elegant dress, rich navy blue color. versatile, can wear with heels, boots, or flats.",1
"I saw this skirt in retailer several months ago and while it caught my eye, it was pricey. so i waited until it went on sale and pounced.  unfortunately i ordered a size 6 which is enroute.   i happened to stop by our local store today and decided to try on the 6 and ended up getting a size 4.  so i'll have to return the size 6 when it arrives.  i think it runs tts. i've lost alot of weight recently.  
the colors are vibrant and it has a nice weight with some stretch in the fabric.  it's a",1
"I paid full price for this cardigan and have not regretted purchase for one minute, having worn it almost every day this summer.  it is the perfect weight for cool summer evenings, seaside strolls, chilly restaurants, or  for a sunblock layer when you have to be outside.",1
"Just bought this cardigan today. i'm already a fan of left of center and was happy with this piece. it's soft, has more interest to it than your average cardi. the sleeves are a bit long, but it's not a dealbreaker. i imagine it will be a great transitional piece from summer to fall and then for spring time.",1
"Beautiful color, bought a small (i am 5'10 and 145 pounds, the length is the only thing that is usually a problem on size small for me) however the chest area was extremely tight and ill fitting i thought, i am only a 34b. i'm returning it. i did think it was pricey for what you get as well. the color was by far the best thing about this dress, it could have been better quality and fit.",0
"Love, love, love this piece! very flowy, but made of good material. glad i purchased this item!",1
"I bought the rose and the sapphire during the xtr 40% off clearance. i'm just under 5'4"", curvy & usually wear med petite in retailer dresses. i ordered a mr because, being sale items, only regular sizing was available. a sp would have been much better! the dress hit about 3"" below my knee and the crisscross top made my bust look matronly. a snugger fit would have been sexier. the rose was darker than pictured & pretty, but eh on me. however, the sapphire was gorgeous. i'm sad about returning it.",0
"I have to agree with the first reviewer! i really loved the color of this dress and could almost have overlooked the lack of a lining, but when i felt the fabric expecting a nice lush silk, instead getting what felt like a polyster instead i couldn't justify it for the price. i really liked the fact that a maxi came in petite sizes as well, but just couldn't get over the poor quality for that price so back it goes! 

i hope the team members or buyers at retailer are reading these reviews",0
"Love this sweater. ordered white, size large. great light layer! the weave in the yarn is really pretty; the variations in texture have an almost burnout look. the silver buttons are unusual, really stand out and complement the overall look of the sweater. it has an uneven hem that drapes beautifully at the back and sides. great value on sale! one of those basics that everyone needs in their wardrobe.",1
"Better than the picture, right chest neck line not too low. comfortable material and the cut is just right. bought two in different color.",1
I bought in white. great for a lightweight cover up. well made and cozy!,1
"The cut of this dress is gorgeous and it could be great if it were made of quality silk and was lined. although the color is beautiful, the cheap fabric has no variation, is too saturated, and lacks any sheen of quality silk. 
shocked at the price. i still have beautiful silk dresses from retailer pre 2010 . being back the quality!",0
"I am a 32dd, 5'4'' and 125lbs and this top was way too baggy. it looked awful. this is shapeless and oversized. i would size down or just pass.",0
I recently purchased this dress and am so happy with it. the gathered area over the bust is visually interesting and isn't too revealing. the jersey material hangs beautifully. i also appreciate it being lined.,1
"I am a big pilcro fan. i have a really tough time finding pants that fit, are comfortable, and flattering all at once, and these didn't disappoint. the colors are beautiful and saturated, and just like they appear in the photos. i got my usual pilcro size, and the colors give me endless styling ideas. i also got them in the black and ivory print.",1
"Fabric felt and looked cheap.  hem was completely frayed, all the way around, perhaps purposely, but ratty looking, all the same.",0
"Looks great, the material feels great but when i put this dress on for the first time today it fell apart at the seams in the rib cage area. total disappointment! i had purchased this on sale for my graduation and was getting ready to walk out the door when i saw two holes on each side!",0
"This gathered jersey dress is beautiful and flows in just the right places, however it runs large! i normally wear a small in many retailer dresses, however i ordered an xs petite in this dress based on other reviews. i'm glad i did because it fits perfectly. the dress is very flattering in the bust...and the rest of the dress hangs and flows nicely. this can be dressed up (with statement jewelry) or down depending on the occasion. i'm happy with my purchase, so much so that i bought one in",1
"I have been searching high and low for some good quality jeans. sadly i don't think these are it. i love the design and style of these jeans. great length, great cut, great color unfortunately in the 3 weeks that i have had them they are balling and looking like i've had them for 3 years. i'm so disappointed. and will have to continue on my search. apparently they don't make jeans like they used too?",0
"This is a pretty red dress. the back is beautiful. i ordered it online and was excited when it arrived. however, as soon as i took it out of the package, i saw that it had a snag on the front bodice. i also did not realize the dress material was not as heavy as i was hoping for it to be. given those two details, i decided to return it. maybe if it had arrived in perfect condition, i would have kept it. *sigh*",0

"Wonderful dress! thank you for making a fun and sassy dress that actually fits me! normally this sort of dress wouldn't fit, with it failing me in the bust, but it fit quite well. in most cases, i would end-up in a 12 petite to accommodate my bust, but with it then too large in the shoulders, or, the dress would have run so small, i wouldn't have been able to button it in most places. i was pleasantly surprised not only with the fit, but the quality, as well.

as described by other reviewers, it",1
"I had been hearing a bit of hype around this dress. it had seemed that most were either loving or hating it, which can be true for a lot of ""swing"" dresses as some give off that ""baby bump"" vibe. i saw a friend try one on in petite and we both agreed it ran a little short, even for us at just over 5 feet tall. 

when i finally made it into a store i noticed that they had quite a few in regular sizing in stock. i grabbed a xs regular to try on and i loved it. with heels, it falls perfectly and",1

"I though this dress would be similar to the turtleneck swing dress by maeve. it's not. first of all, it runs very large. i purchased a small (i am usually a xs or small in maeve, i purchased a small in the turtleneck swing dress). the shoulders were very wide, you had to manually cross the fabric around your neck but it didn't lay as flat as what i wanted around my chest, and it was quite large around my rib cage and stomach making it rather shapeless. i really wanted this dress to work (i love",0
I am currently wearing this dress. i wear it whenever i can get away with it. i have it in red and it works incredible on my coloring. the front is modest enough for work while the back is sweet and unexpected.,1
"I don't know if i was sent a petite by mistake, but this is not 39 inches long. i realize it says swing dress, but i thought if the length was accurate and the fabric heavy enough, the weight would make it flattering on me. as it was in reality--short and light-weight fabric--it poofed out in an unattractive way. too bad, as the print is lovely.",1
"I have been on the search for a perfect lbd for years and have wasted money on dresses that i had to settle for but when i saw this dress i knew it was love at first sight!!! the things i love about this dress: the built in shaper/slip holds your junk in place, the lace detailing is perfect in all the right places, and the button and hook & eye makes you feel secure. great dress that you will love!!",1
"I do love this dress. i wore it for my 20th anniversary party and received numerous compliments. it's great for embracing your curves. it has a wonderful ""vintage-made-modern"" flair that classic retailer pieces always have. you do have to be careful when wearing it...jewelry or belts may snag the intricate lacework. i am definitely the type of shopper who waits for a sale. this is one of the few pieces i felt i could splurge on. it is just that unique. i hope that retailer continues to carry these t",1

Read all the reviews i didn't really understand that it really had real shape wear in the skirt. i live in florida and found the dress to be too confining and hot. i would never get any wear out of it. much better for someone up north. had to return it.,1
"I was so excited to purchase this dress; i love all shades of grey for winter clothing, i love knits, and i have loved other maeve dresses. however, i simply cannot fathom how poorly this is designed--it fits absolutely nothing like it appears to on the model, to the point that i wonder if i might have received a defective dress.

"Tried it on at the local store today, it is very pretty! i believe i runs large. i am usually a small, but they only had an xs and it fit perfectly. it is made of thick linen and has a lining.",1
"The first surprise is that in person, the material is actually kind of woolen? at least, i would definitely call it a winter knit. the colors are also a little different -- so much so that i didn't recognize it in the store. i'm not sure if the one i tried on was stretched out, but it definitely ran large on me. the waistband is elastic, so i would worry about is stretching over time. i would have been curious to see what the petite option looked like on me, as the regular version was longer tha",0

I absolutely love this dress. i am 5'0 and 167 pounds and the extra large was way too big. the large was perfect. the fabric is substantial but the fit is loose and swingy so it is good for the atlanta heat and humidity. i want to wear this every day.,1

It looks so cute and i love the detail on this dress but it was not flattering on me. light summer dress and that was exactly what i needed but i had to exchange it with something else.,1
"While i wanted to love this dress, i did not like the scratchy lining. i also did not like that the scratchy lining was considerably smaller than the overall swing of the dress; so it clung to my curves uncomfortably. i wish this had been done in silk, would have been a much nicer material. i returned it.",0

This skirt is perfect! it just pulls on and lays nice and smooth. the fabric is soft and just the right thickness and stretch. i wore it with black tights and knee high boots for new year's eve and had many compliments! it runs a tad big. i am about 130lb and the small fits great although a tad larger than i would have expected. i assume it might srink in the wash a little anyway. my new favorite!,1

"Walked in intending to purchase another jacket and ended up leaving with this one. the color is advertised as grey, but it's actually more like a light mocha. the slightly darker fabric on the side and around the waist accentuated my curves and i believe it would help give the illusion of an hourglass figure to those who are more straight and slender. i generally wear a size 12 and m or l size tops depending on the designer. i purchased the l in this case because that's all that was available at",1
Where o where did the old pilcro ankle stet go??? these are a cheap impersonator. the denim used to be thick which really did wonders for the fit and overall appearance of how the denim lays over your lower half. the last 3 pairs of pilcro stets i've ordered have gone right back because they are nowhere close to the greatness they were originally. the pockets on these jeans sit so so low- completely unflattering. the ankles are significantly smaller circumferentially. the old stet ankle jeans ha,0
"This dress is really pretty. i went with the navy, the detail on the bottom is very detailed. it does run very large. i went down two sizes. there is a lot of material and my size made me look like a tent. once i sized down, it was much more flattering and nice. couple details:
the slip is strechable and may have to be fitted if you size down, but you can't see it since it's lose on the outer layer. also, you need a different bra since the cut is cloer to the neck revealing the bra straps. i am",1
"Waist is tight and thighs and legs are not. -not flattering- ankle opening is too small, and they have a funny smell.",0
"This is such a pretty romper! i love the fabric. unfortunately, it's pretty roomy and the cut didn't flatter my figure.. the straps are adjustable which is great. but, even so, the xs was still a tad too big on the sides. for reference, i'm 126 lbs, 5' 6"", and a 34b chest. the cut of the butt & thighs is also quite generous. stylistically, this adds to the design and looks cool...if you have a few curves to fill it out. i have slim hips and not much of a butt so it looked a little ""dumpy"" on me.",1
"For a couple weeks, i debated making this purchase. in fear that my size would no longer be available, i ordered this lovely top. when it arrived, i was immediately disappointed with its colors...unlike the vibrant colors in the photo, the top's colors were dull...more a brown than orange and gray rather than lavender. had the fit been better, i would have kept this item despite of its color. it's cut weird! though it runs slightly large, i felt the top was ill fitted through the upper bust and",0
This top is really pretty & i think i will be happy when i pull it out in the spring to wear it. the only complaint is that the front is very sheer. you have to wear an under shirt of some kind.,1
"This is exactly the same cut as the breton peasant blouse, which i also ordered. it's extremely tight thru the bust and the sleeves are very wide at the top which adds width to the look of this blouse. it added 20 pounds! the print is beautiful. the ruffles are trimmed with a golden colored thread which is a beautiful detail. i ordered size large and am well endowed. steer clear if you have a bust.",0
I'm always scared of rompers because of my height and long legs. but this one was perfect. it didn't ride up or hit in a weird spot on the hips. it's very flattering.,1
"This is a beautiful dress. the quality is excellent. the 3 layers and the embroidery are beautiful... however it just didn't look right on me. it looked like a maternity dress. i am very petite, short with a big bust and it just did nothing for me. i think this style would look best on a tall woman with a smaller bust. unfortunately i will be returning this dress.",0
"Loved this jumper, i usually wear between a small and a medium in retailer (with jumpers it's mainly because of my hips and where the midline sits on my stomach), so thought this one would probably be a medium. but it was definitely baggy/lose. otherwise i would've totally kept it!",1
"I love this jumpsuit! i ordered it unsure, but i am so glad i did! it is super comfy and fit perfectly. i loved the length...can dress up or down. it is super flattering as well as i am curvy on the bottom and was told i looked ""trim"". my mom, friends, and complete strangers complimented me when i wore this...and that's when you know you scored.",1
"Stunning, beautiful, elegant, comfortable and all silk!  the print is very mesmerizing, as are all the hemant & nandita pieces i own.  i'm shocked that there aren't more reviews.  i found this fit perfectly on my body, skimming over my flaws and keeping my temperature moderate.  i am 5'3"" 140# 39-28-35 and purchased size mp.  please retailer, offer the other versions of this dress as shown on the uk retailer site.",1
"I really love this dress. it runs very true to size and is nice and long, but could be easily hemmed. i am 5'10' and have room for heels. the waist runs just slightly high and causes a slight flare out of the fabric at the hips but it is not a deal breaker. the cotton is super light weight and perfect for summer. some jersey fabric maxi 's can be super hot. i was surprised by the cost for the actual quality of the dress.",1
"I originally ordered this top in the black and it's been on back order for a month. i decided to go ahead and try the wine and i am so glad that i did!  the fit is flattering with a longer peplum to accommodate my long torso, the fabric is a nice mid weight with a very subtle brocade  pattern. the back of the neck has a classic zipper detail. the bell sleeves are not too long and the color is gorgeous for fall/winter. i highly recommend this top for all body types.",1
"I had high hopes for this dress, but unfortunately   was disappointed and returned the dress. it flares out with too much material under the gathered waist. it's so odd.",0
I just bought this dress on the half off sale price which is practically a steal and i must say i absolutely adore it! it runs pretty tts but all they had available was one size up from my usual 6 so i bought the 8 and it fits just fine (34d-27-35). the color is beautiful and the look of the dress is very vintage 30's/40's and so cute. i didn't find the sleeves to stick out at all on me so maybe i just got lucky and the print is just adorable on this. i highly recommend!,1
"I so wanted to love this dress. i bought it in a size 4 and in both petite and regular, as i'm kind of in between and have a long torso and short legs. anyway, i'm 5'5"" tall and 130 lbs. the regular fit my torso well, and length not was too bad. with heals it might have worked without hemming. here is where it all fell apart. while understand that only really expensive designer clothing can afford to seam a pattern perfectly, i felt that the dot seam in the front of the dress was in a bad place.",0
"The detail on the fabric of this blouse is beautiful and unique, especially the peachy/pink and orange detailing which is hard to see in the picture. the fabric and seam are quite delicate though so it just needs to be worn and handled with care. fits true to size. 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c and the small is perfect.",1
"I love wearing my boatneck pullover. the unique part of this item is the back with buttons. the shirts appears to be inside out, however, its not. its soft, comfortable, stylish and warm. i really like how it's longer in the back.",1
"I am not a fan of sweater dresses and did not pay attention to this one when looking at it on-line. however, it immediately caught my attention in a store, i decided to put it on and the dress looked amazing. soft, warm, skin hugging material, long skinny sleeves and more importantly, i looked amazing in this dress.i think colors are more vibrant, design is more lively in person than in picture. i am 5'10'' 145lb, so i loved that intricate dress pattern, broken lines in front made me not look li",1
"I got the shirt, the cami, and the shorts and they are all great. super comfortable fabric, really well made, and really cute. love them all!",1
I probably would have never purchased this blouse is i had only seen it online. but i was at our local store looking for something else and spotted it hanging all the way on the other end of the store. a salesperson encouraged me to try it on and it is beautiful! it can easily be dressed up or down. you can tie the bow in multiple ways or leave it hanging. it is sheer but the pattern obscures the transparency so no camisole is needed. it embraces the 70's vibe in a modern way. i absolutely love,1
"I ordered both the black & the dark grey, the dark grey arrived first! they are very comfortable & flattering! there is a nice thigh slimming effect. i purchased the size small, regular length & they hit me at my ankle (5,5"", 130lbs), i can't wait for the second pair to arrive!",1
These leggings are great in quality and are thick enough to wear as pants; the rise is perfect. the only issue is that they stretch during wear and end up being a size larger.,1
"Great fabric.  nice legging, substantial fabric, more structured than a typical legging.",1
"Wonderful fit - love that these have a bit of texture to them and the structure is perfect. easy to wear with ankle boots or flats, and thick enough that you don't have to worry about see-through incidents. the only issue that i have is that the elastic in the waistband isn't secured, so it tends to twist around - just a minor annoyance and wouldnt stop me from ordering these in another color!",1
"I'm 5'7"" with a dd bust and this top in a medium doesn't even hit at my hip. i'm not sure why so many of these tops are being made so short! i just purchased another peasant lace top that has the same problem #it ends up being very boxy looking!#. adding a few inches in length would have made this top perfection! debating about ordering a large just to add length but otherwise the tops fits everywhere else ;# it's so pretty though! the lace detail and the nude panel are so delicate and the mater",1
I tried this on in the store and decided to order a larger size online. the fabric by the buttons is very thin so any pulling will cause tears the one i tried on in store was shredded by someone else trying it. i'm a 34 dd and bought a 14. before trying it on i noticed the fabric is already pulling a little right out of the package. trying to decide if it is worth keeping or will be destroyed from wearing.   it really is very cute on.,1
"Great pair of black pants, a step up from basic leggings. nice weight and a little ribbed detail on the sides. would recommend.",1
"This is the little black dress i've been looking for for years -- great slim fit (runs small -- i usually get sized out but the 00 was a snug fit), eye-catching design. like the other reviewer, i think solid black panels rather than floral brocade would have been classier, but overall a chic dress.",1
"Perfect fit, nice detailing best feature is that they do not bag out
after wearing for a short time. good lines in back so they are more
dressy than a regular legging.",1
"This top is beautiful online and in person. i am in no way a large full figured gal, but i did order an xl. reading the past review and wanting an airy fit i ordered a larger size. this shirt is horribly tiny in person! the xl regular fit looked like an xs. have no idea if this particular shirt sent to me was miss sized or what. will take back. other than fit, the shirt is very beautiful in every way.",0
Cute in the on line photo but in person it looks cheap and has gold running through it. if you look really close in the photo you can see it.,0
"I loved this blouse, but had to return. i am 5'2"", 127 lbs. 36d. i found that the blouse was tight in the bust and very wide in the shoulders. the sleeves are puffy, which is fine, but the wideness is from edge of the bib to where the sleeve is attached and therefore the top did not lay flat. if you have wide shoulders and a small bust - this blouse will be perfect for you. i liked the material, it was thin but perfect for a summer nights.",1
"They are a perfect thickness. fits comfortably like leggings but look like a nice pair of office/ outside pant. got them in the grey, am thrilled w the texture. i typically wear a large in pants and they are tts. not see through either. would definitely recommend them.",1
Good quality fabric and structure but the mix media details and lines make them seem more like jodphurs than leggings. it's hard to see where i would wear them ... sorry but they have to go back.,0
"I love almost all tops from retailer, however this one was just enormous. it is beautifully designed, but it was so huge when i tried it on that i couldn't believe it was sized 0. i even checked the tag to see if maybe they placed a size 0 tag on an xl shirt. for reference, i am 5'2"" and 110lbs. i would have loved this shirt if it hadn't been so big.",0
"On the hanger i thought this had a chance, but oh geez... puffy sleeves, itchy, metallic thread, lace... what a mess. and thin. and uncomfortable. no, no, no.",0
This is perfection in the color sky. get you one now. you will not regret it. it is super soft and flattering!,1
"As much as i had wanted this to work for me, it didn't. fabric is not as soft as i had expected and quality is just bad. i purchased this online (on sale at $29.95) and i had envisioned this to be comfy stretchy and swingy with a flow. i sent this back to the store as it didn't seem fit even at the low price.",0
"I ordered this in white and it's quite sheer. as others have noted, it is really full and it hits at mid-hip which doesn't work on my figure. if it had been a few inches longer and more of a tunic, or less voluminous, it could have worked but nope.",0
"I saw this online yesterday and i was in the store today to try it on. i assumed it would look average or below average on me and i could just walk away no problem. by no means am i in the financial bracket to be spending this much money on a jumpsuit, yet here i am at home wearing it as i write this review. it is surprisingly flattering. i am 5 feet tall and have a petite frame so wide leg pants never work on me, but this somehow did without making me look bulky. given my height, it comes to ab",1
"The colors in this dress are beautiful (the green/blue version) but the fabric is a very see through mesh and feels flimsy. i purchased it online and wasn't expecting it to be so sheer -- the particular empire cut combined with the fabric makes it feel more like a nightgown, i really wanted to love it but it's going back.",0
"This is an absolutely beautiful dress, but arrived with several holes in it!",0
"My favorite shirt!!! i wear it when i don't want to be in the sun too long, it has breathable material in the armpit. i loved so much ordered in other colors. i wish they would make in more colors!",1
"I absolutely love this jacket! it's one of the best things i've bought this season. the interior is so unbelievably soft. i just want to wrap myself in it with nothing but a tank top on underneath so i can really feel the texture against my skin. the fit is beautiful, as is the pattern. it's even better in person than in the photo. it is pricey, but for the longevity and pleasure that i can imagine myself getting out of it, it's well worth it.",1
"I tried hard to make this work because it is beautiful, but ended up returning it. first, it is very delicate material - i was terrified trying it on. second, i just couldn't make the drawstring work for me to achieve the fit i wanted. third, it was too low for me and would need a cami over the slip. while i didn't think the colors were as deep as the picture, it was still pretty. i could have possibly gone down a size to fix some of my concerns, but then i know it would have been too short for",0
"I wanted to love this dress because the fabric is fun, but i could not find a way to make the drawstring waist look like anything but a potato sack.the model has her hands hiding the lack of a waistline",0
"I love this shirt - beautiful casual wear, great with jeans!",1
Highly recommend these jeans! they are ultra-soft and fit your body like a dream. the wash is flattering on them as well. i was looking for a pair of jeans to be my go to and ultimately landed on these. they do runa little big but they do not stretch out much so i went with my usual size.,1
"This is much prettier online than on me. too much dress, even though i sized down.",0
"I have received several compliments when wearing this sweater. perfect to dress up or dress down. purchased it in black and red. does run on large. i am 5'3"" roughly 110 lbs ordered an xs.",1
"I have to send the skirt back. i agree with other reviewers who say the slits are extremely high, the ""underskirt"" bunches and the fabric snags easily. additionally, the yarn was already fraying at the top of the slits, and the label was stitched on the outside of the waist band. disappointed in the quality of this skirt, given the pretty steep price.",0
"I was extremely disappointed with the quality of this product. as soon as i put this tunic, the right tie loop detached from the garment. i could return it but the point of shopping online was to avoid the hassle of going to the store. the price of the item does not justify the low quality of the final product.",0
These are literally the most comfortable and the softest jeans i have ever owned. i just got them a few weeks ago and i'm already obsessed with them. they have the perfect amount of stretch that makes them flattering and comfortable but they don't stretch out like all my other jeans do. i ordered my usual size 28 and they fit great! can't recommend these enough!,1
"I had this shirt in mauve and loved it so i ordered it in navy. i love the lightweight material. i love the way it fits. however - all the seams are sewn, quite obviously, inside out. only after i received the navy shirt, where it is extremely obvious, did i check the mauve one. those seams are also inside out but done in a much tidier fashion so that it wasn't really noticable. i was unhappy with the sloppiness of the seams on the navy shirt but, because i love the style and the fit, i kept it.",0
"This skirt looks cute online but, it has several issues. 1.) the slit is very high, this photo is deceptive, look closely...the slit is actually to her finger tips. you cant wear any kind of spanx or control top tights. 2.) slits on both sides so when you walk they fly away. 3.) the micro mini ""slip"" bunches. 4.) the fine knit is very snag-able. 5.) the skirt is very long. it is going back.",0
"I love everything about this tunic dress. it's versatile and can be styled a few ways: loose like a shift, blouson when cinched, or eliminate the liner and wear as a layer over whatever you want. all the little details make it stand out and give it a glamorous bohemian vibe. there are tiny beads, sequins and subtle micro pleating. the fabric is airy and quite delicate (be careful.) the drawstrings at the waist are adjustable for both sides. slip is tts and the outer dress has a subtle oversize d",1
I just received this dress wadded up in a bag. it is nothing like the colors shown on line. in the picture it appears blue and white. in actuality it is teal and a funky color of beigey pink. the top is see though but it does see have a slip under the skirt. will be sending it back and again remind myself why i shouldn't try to buy a dress on line.,0
"My new favorite cozy and stylish ""go-to"" piece for everything from park with the kiddos to mat class to impromptu financial meetings.",1
Love this tank! it's super soft and has a lovely drape. i got 3 colors on sale and am so glad i did!,1
The shirt fits true to size. the length of the top is great: not too short (won't show your midrift when you raise your arms) not too long (this is a shirt not a dress). this is a great top for a casual day in jeans or a flirty day with skirt to dress it up.,1
This top is gorgeous in person! i'm in love with it! it's perfect for the holiday season. it runs a little big and long so i suggest going down a size for a more tailored fit.,1
I saw this jacket in the store and thought it was really cute..and finally a nice length!! ordered the xl because l and was afraid of shrinkage and it is no larger than the l. runs at least a size small with not alot of give. i will unfortunately have to bring it back.,0
"Cute tank, runs big. i purchased the mango and it's a bit sheer.",1
"Low waisted, weird liner.",0
"Had the same inconsistent sizing issue in coral as miss janeausten. i ordered 2 corals, one in s & one in xs & the s was very much smaller than the xs as i could barely get my arms into the s (while my arms were loose in the xs). keeping the ""larger than s"" xs coral - the color is just lovely. also ordered the ivory in both ps & pm & keeping the pm as i like the longer arm length to cover my hands (for sun protection when i want/need). because you can cinch the waist tightly, a looser jacket sti",1
"I just received them (blue) and wore them today. i got so many compliments! they are comfy and very flattering. i would not call the fabric cheap at all. it is super soft and washes and wears nicely. i ordered the medium and they fit perfectly, even though i am on the large side of medium. i'm ordering the other color right now!",1
"Close but no cigar...  the design and color were cute.  the sweater itself was too warm for me, and itchy.  the top fit snugly in the chest and shoulders but it came out a little strangely at the bottom, it almost had strange fold in the front.  look closely at some of the photos and you'll see what i mean.  sadly it went back.",0
"Bummed out.. this is super cheaply made and very expensive... the design is different , the color is beautiful, but the material is a different story.. it should be priced at the most 30 bucks.. not 128.. i'm returning them. also, they run very big..!",0
"This is the perfect simple tank for summer. not clingy, and hangs really nicely, but not so billowy that you can't layer a nice wrap or cardigan over it. fabric feels like a great quality. i got it in white, and it's a bit sheer, but i typically layer my tanks anyway. tempted to get this in every color!",1
"Love this tank. it's nice and loose and looks great with all kinds of bottoms. it's very forgiving if you have a midsection. it's soft, and great colors. really nice for spring casual looks.",1
The colors are beautiful,1
"I ordered both the green and the pink and needed the extra extra small petite in the shirt to make it work for me 
 nice light material cute fit 
 unfortunately didn't like the pink color was too bright for me  ( and although i ordered an extra extra small petite they sent me an extra small petite which is just slightly too big )and saw the mango in the store which i also didn't like the color",1
I live in a hot and humid climate so this tank is perfect for everyday use. you can dress it up or down and the lightweight material keeps you cool. i bought it in 2 colors and may go back for more. i wish i would have found them sooner.,1
The uniqueness of this top caught my eye online. i normally wld not want a long sleeve top in the summer. a bit warm to wear outside now but i like the casual but unique style of it. it's a top i can wear now but only indoors with a/c. the regular small fits fine. a little oversized & sleeves a little long - as in the pic. the color/style/detaling is exactly as in the pic - no surprises. soft & comfy. a little opaque but a nude bra will work fine. i don't see the need for a tank/cami under it. i,1
"I bough this top in blue and i really like the color , style and fabric. i also bough the necklace as styled in the photo and they look well together. it's a departure from more tailored clothing for me. 
i keep on trying linen tops and up to now, this seems the best cut for linen. as the fabric stretches, it will still fall nicely.",1
"It runs large. loose or oversized tops don't bother me so i thought it would be fine, but this just made me look wider then i am. is thin and too sheer for me as well. it was just so unflattering. i had to return it.",0
"I thought i would need a medium in this top, but it was sold out so i crossed my fingers on a small. it fits very well, much like it fits on the model.. loose and length is good ( and i am not as slender as that model!). i am 5'6"", 140 lbs). the sweetheart neckline dips a little more than i would like in the front....but i will figure that out. the top is really unique and i love the shimmery dots.",1
"Beautiful color, gorgeous chic design and great material",1
"This item is huge. i'm normally a medium, sized down to a small, still massive. couldn't go too much smaller because the buttons would pull at the chest. but the sleeves are very wide, as is the waist. way too much fabric. i had high hopes for this one but it just doesn't work. for reference i love billowy and flowy tops, but this was a tent.",0
"I really loved the dress in the picture. it is really
nice quality. unfortunately it was really long. i am
5'4 and it was about 8 inches too long. hemming it
would have ruined the details of the dress. they were
backordered on petites in my size ,so, i just returned it.",1
I love the color of this top but the style is not flattering. i normally wear a l or xl in retailer clothes and i ordered a l in this and it was massive! i went into the store to try on a medium and it fit much better but is still very bulky around the middle where the ruffles are and it is very wide. bummer,0
"I loved the design and look to this shirt, but it ran way big for me. i loved the forgiving fit, but it just wasn't flattering at all. i even went down one size and it still was huge. sad to send this one back.",0
Seems there was a design defect in this item--sleeves are way too tight and hardly go on without ripping the shirt. i have pretty thin arms so it's hard to imagine this not happening on anyone. too bad because it's otherwise a very nice top.,0
"This dress is super feminine and pretty, wore to my nephew's birthday party.  fit is spot on - i'm a 34c, 5'7"", and 135 and size 4 fit true to size.  my only complaint is that the dress not come with extra beads.  i only wore once and already lost a bead form the bodice.  for this price range, extra beads should be included.",1
"This top looks adorable in the product photos, so i had high hopes. i think i might be too short to pull it off, but like another reviewer said, i found it to be like a tent on me, billowing out in all directions. it was just overall too big on me--i even considered whether i could wear it as a dress, but the sleeves were also too billowy on me. i am 5'4"", 120 lbs and tried the xs.",0
"This dress is great if you're very skinny and have no chest. otherwise, it makes you look dowdy. the colors are also quite washed out and do nothing for my complexion.

this one is going back.",0
Love this top. purchased for family photos and i think it's great. personally i don't think the model shot is doing it justice - it's much prettier in person. runs true to size for retailer. i am a 34d and i purchased a small.,1
"Ordered this dress in an xs, that is the size i usually wear. this runs small, but not only that it is the way it is cut, very small through the hips, thighs and legs. hard to walk in it. the material felt kind of cheap to me. i thought it looked really good on the model, but got it home and didn't like it at all! it went back!",0
"I am petite, 5'2, and i ordered the xxsp, i think it is so adorable on and looks great with skinny/slim pants or leggings. i do not think it runs that large, it is suppose to be loose and flowy and it looks on me exactly how it looks on the model. i got the gray print and it is quite pretty.",1
"I love the idea of this top and ordered it in white. it is a great design and proportion is nice with jeans. the front is off white t shirt material with a pocket and the back is a light grey heathered panel. i am returning it as it is very thin and the quality is cheap looking. if the grade of material had been a bit thicker and better made, then it would have been a winner!",0
This is a beautiful dress but unfortunately it is only for women who are not well endowed - it is extremely well fitted in the chest. the high waste also poufs out due to a lot of extra material and the double lining. a beautiful dress but a very very poor construction. also there are bright blue and yellow beads in the chest area that are a bizarre combo to the corals and browns of the fabric. i am normally a 4/6 at retailer and the 8 was extremely small.,0
"I bought this in a large, i'm normally an xl. it is a very large on the bottom. i really like that style so the extra fabric was good. i tried on the white and orange. the white is sheer and i didn't like the fabric as much. the orange way really cute though!",1
"Could not wait for this to come and so disappointed.  first of all, it's not a happy orange, it a darker rust.  second, it is huge.  fits in the shoulders and is super comfy and cute but would be a dynamite maternity top.  you could go to term in this blouse!  back it goes.  so sad.",0
"Was surprised by the cute factor and great fit. the fabric is soft, it flows perfectly and isn't too long. it covers my rear. no gapping at the chest and i'm large busted. i got a large. the shirt is black and the florals in the pattern are a soft muted white. those little balls are small and more noticeable from the back. looks great under a jean jacket!",1
This top has dry clean only. didn't like the fabric. plus mine was a return. i also returned it because the left arm has a hole. now it's for sale again. if your looking to buy a large. don't.,0
"I love this dress! i'm 5'5"", and it's just long enough to be dramatic and graze my feet without dragging on the ground with flat sandals. the print is lovely and the beading is subtle. as some have mentioned, the neck is high. it's definitely noticeable, but i didn't find it uncomfortable.",1
"This is a beautiful kimono but just isn't made well. the one i received already had a couple small holes and a pull in the thread that was very noticeable. after reading the additional reviewer who wore it an hour and it was already pilling, it is going back for good. such a shame!",0
"I loved this dress and the color. i wanted to wear it to my niece's wedding. i usually wear a medium but couldn't get it on. the large was perfect in the top but too tight in the hips for a wedding even with spanks. the xl was perfect is the hips in that it didn't cut, but the top was huge. i really don't understand the sizing of this dress at all.",0
"This is not a kimono. it's a cocoon. there's a huge difference.

it's also not made very well.",0
This is an awesome shirt! gorgeous quality and design. can be dressed up or down! it runs slightly large i ordered a small. i would still order a small but if you are trying to decide between a small and an extra small i would get the extra small.,1
"I wanted to love this as i love holding horses but it fits weird, slender in arms but baggy in the torso. i will be returning",0
"It's sheer, the design /print is casual, but on silk like material. had it been made out of cotton would have definitely kept it! who is going to wear this in the blazing heat of summer???",0
"Although this is a very lovely dress in the pictures, and it has a lovely quality in person, the shape and orientation of the dress is very awkward. the attached slip makes it tricky to put on, and the sizing between the top and the hips seems inconsistent (tight in the hips, large in the top). not quite for my body type - maybe better for someone with slim hips and a bigger bust.",0
"Was going to order this top in orange but could not decide what size. i am either a large or xl. i found that the top was in stock in a local retailer in white and went to try it for size. first, the top is huge. i tried the large on and it fit me across the bust and shoulders nicely. the rest of the top was like a large tent. the white is an off white and really is not attractive looking. in fact, in the store, it was displayed with a jacket over it. online, the orange looks completely different,",0
"Gorgeous dress, soft + silky material, and flattering on most body types. best purchase i've made at retailer in a long time, i get compliments every time i wear it!",1
"What a beautiful dress! a size 2 fit me perfectly- 5'5 120lbs. i have a small ribcage so it works on me but it might be too tight for someone with a larger one. the fabric is of amazing quality and i was so glad to see there is a liner under the skirt. the top has some delicate beading which looks great but i am concerned it will fall off at some point. i have found that retailer clothing tends to have loose buttons and beading. i have not washed it yet so i am hoping it holds up. otherwise, i am",1
"I feel so lucky to have caught this as a popback--this dress is killer! it's casual style and simple design can be found at other retailers, but the quality and details and fit can only be made by retailer and dolan. it's body skimming but lined so it doesn't cling to flaws, the knit itself is substantial and it's a mockneck, not a turtleneck. i would say this dress runs small because i usually buy medium and this fit in a large. because of weight and lining, this is a spring and early fall dress",1
I ordered this dress online and did not realize it had beaded details on the bodice... gorgeous dress - perfect for festival season.,1
"Love this maxi! gorgeous print, flowy and romantic. in my opinion runs a bit tight in the chest- i sized up from my usual 6 to an 8 and it was perfect. i am 5'7"" and it was floor length without tripping me up. looks great on darker skin. i am on the fair side (winter skin!) and the beige color down the middle looked flesh-toned and washed me out a bit, but with a tan this dress will be perfect!",1
"I bought the orange in xxs petite, and the cream in the xsp as it did not come in xxs.

i like a swing style, but this is a tent. the material in the cream is fairly sheer, and i found hanging threads that came from suspect seams. the overall effects was being lost in all the fabric. they rather skew old school maternity in summation. mine are going back.",0
"I wanted to love this dress - everything about it was so beautiful - except the fit , the length, the neckline ... i tried on a 4, 6 and petite 4. i'm 5'5"" 130 32dd - the top of the dress runs small/tight - so i needed to try it on without a bra.
the length on the regular is to the floor/with the petite to my ankles. the print was beautiful and like in the photo, it flowed nicely but there was just too much fabric - maybe it was just the design for me - it did nothing for my figure at all",0
This piece didn't make sense to me.  maybe it's bc i'm a yankee fan but it reminded me of a high end baseball jersey that was sheer.  i didn't think it was office appropriate but too dressy for casual wear.  it went back.,0
"This shirt is so small. i am not sure who came up with the sizing but you have to go up several sizes to get a comfortable fit. don't waste your time on this shirt. such a shame, it could have been very cute.",0
"Pretty color, but i was hoping for a thicker, higher quality material for the price. the material is lightweight and isn't tailored well. looks kind of sloppy.",0
I fell in love with this poncho at first sight. the colors are neutral so it can be worn with a lot. i'm a typical m and it does run large so i went with a s and it's perfect. long enough to cover leggings and great for the in between seasons. i've worn it at least five times since purchase and get compliments every time.,1
Looks better online than in person. material makes it look a little puffy,0
"I ordered this vest in xxs, since i am usually an xs and was looking for a bit of a tighter fit on such a loose vest. even then, the vest looked like a large. not only was it incredibly loose - much looser than in looks in the picture - but the arm holes were huge too. it just looked too big, not artfully drapey.",0
"I really wanted to like this... it's soft and cozy and a nice shade of blue, but that's where the positives end. i ordered the xs and it was huge. wide, shapeless, and way too long (i'm 105lbs and 5'1). even if it came in petite, i'm not sure it's worth the price, because i can imagine the thin material losing its shape and getting stretched out.",0
"I absolutely love ag stevie ankle jeans and own them in three different colors. i'm on the shorter side, so in terms of length i'm able to wear them as regular jeans. the fabric is comfy and stretchy and the range of colors is great for wardrobe diversity and mixing and matching! this particular style is my absolute favorite. although ag jeans are on the pricier side, after i bought my first pair i was a convert. as opposed to other brands, i find that they are a worthwhile investment. as other",1
"I have the t shirt from last year and i love it so could not wait to try the dress. why didn't you make it in petite? it can work with some tailoring but petite sizing esp since this runs on the big side, would have been ideal. love the navy, will try the white. how about some more colors and petite?? please??? more t shirt dresses in general too please!!",1
"Very sweet color , will go with everything . soft material . generously sized but cut is meant to be comfy .",1
I love these jeans! you can dress them up or down.,1

I bought this skirt in my usual xxs petite and the waist was way too small. i could not even pull the skirt all the way up. returned,0
"I purchased this dress in white and am quite happy with the fit and design. not too fancy but definitely not casual either. easy to dress up or down and can be worn for various occasions. the fit is great, but i do wish it was not so lose around the belly (it truly is fine though). has more of the hanging feel than the fitted feel. very comfortable for an evening out.",1
"These ag stevie ankle jeans only have 50% cotton.tthe rest is 41% lyocell (a rayon), 7% polyester, and 2% polyurethane. result: thin and clingy jeans that show every lump, and stretch out.

these are no longer the same lovely ags in twill when they were at 80% cotton, 18% modal, 2% pu. it seems ag has also stopped making denim and corduroy with 98% cotton, at least in the stevies.

"I loved the blue brocade since it's a little unusual, paired with a top that brings an otherwise formal fabric into something you could wear out to dinner, plus a little pop of extra color from the ribbon! my biggest fear ordering online was that the top would look cheap - fortunately it doesn't. the top of the dress was fitted (i wore my usual size). what i didn't expect, though, is the skirt is really poofs out a lot below the ribbon, which runs just below the bust. the photo online shows a li",0
"I purchased these jeans because they were on sale and i figured they'd be a good alt to my other white denim jeans. these have by far exceeded my expectations! my fav jeans, period. i'm 5'2 1/2"" but have a long torso and though west size 25, am athletic and curvy, so petite jeans don't really work for me. these are just the best cut and fit!",1
This is the most beautiful dress. i am so happy that i got it. it is very comfortable and the colors are brilliant. it's completely appropriate for a holiday party which is what i got it for and i'll be wearing it to a wedding in may also.,1
"This dress is such a crazy beautiful color, the picture doesn't do it justice. i ordered this right when i saw it, and i almost love it. the color is very bright and the fabric seems nice, but i just didn't find it flattering at all. the slip wasn't the nicest, but completely not a deal breaker. i didn't think it was overly flattering on the model either, so i was hoping by some miracle that i would like it anyway, but something about the way it's cut is just a little off for me. it was very tru",0
"I try to find something to like about everything i buy, even if it turns out to be a disappointment. for me the neckline of this shirt is absolutely beautiful and super flattering. it was one of the only things that made me want to keep the shirt, but unfortunately it was not enough. this shirt is super boxy and runs large. i would recommend sizing down for those who want to try this. if you have a larger chest it might be worth ordering your regular size so that the buttons won't pull at the ch",0

"I decided to splurge. i would not normally spend $200 for a pair of jeans, but when they went on sale, i decided to go for it. i am so glad that i did. mother has a customer for life. these jeans are the best by far. i normally wear a size 4 (27) in most jeans, but wear a 28 in j brand and some others. so i was a little nervous by previous reviewers not just on this website. i decided to go with the 28 since in mother brand this is actually a 4/6. they fit great!",1
"I love the pattern and style of this top. it is a flattering cut, however, it was way too short. i am 5'6"" and small usually fits me without issue. sadly enough i had to return it.",0
"I had loved this on-line when i saw the pretty floral pattern. however, in person, it is such a disappointment. the quality of the fabric and the fit are just very poor.",0
In the photos i have a different tank underneath than the one that comes with the shirt. i am wearing a medium and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40.,1
"This is an amazing top. fits perfectly, beautiful detail, and amazing fabric. i actually came back to the site just so i could order it in all available colors, but unfortunately it's only in navy. don't hesitate to buy this!",1
"Unlike some of the other reviewers, i found this dress to be true to size. post pregnancy i am a 6 on top and an 8 on the bottom. ordered a 6 and it is perfect. (140 lbs and 34c) perhaps that's because i'm long waisted and the waistline hits right below my rib cage?

the colors, materials and quality are wonderful. i can see wearing this in the winter and summer. in fact, it will look lovely against sun kissed skin.

one thing, the top portion appeared to be a knit in the pictures online, howeve",1
I love this dress. it is so comfortable and easy to wear. i was able to wear it to work and look nice but stylish. it was nice that it isn't too heavy but the turtleneck kept me warm enough.,1
"Nice soft jeans, cute style, and i wish i could keep them...they just are too small on me. :/ not sure if i've gained weight (which i don't think i have because i had on a size 28 pair of pants today) but i ordered a size 29 in these jeans and they zipped but just too snug around the waist. i would honestly need a 30 or 31. looks like they are selling out quickly so i doubt i'll be able to get the size i need. 
if you have a small waist i think they would be fine but they don't fit my body type",1
"This dress was so pretty on the hanger but a saggy sack on. even the sz 0 was too loose and shapeless. there is no waist as pictured. the hi-low hem, loose fit and wavy waist seam (see in the third close-up picture) make it look like the dress shrunk oddly in the wash. it's really too bad, it's such a pretty combination of patterns.",0
"I should have listened to the reviews that said this top was too boxy, but i didn't believe them and bought it anyway. i was wrong! this top is so boxy and wide, just awful.",0
"I love this dress. it is very cute and comfortable and great for football games / everyday wear. it is a little long, which is great for me since i'm taller.",1
"I'm normally a small in retailer tops. i ordered a small, and the top fit well in the shoulders and in the upper (more fitted) part. it all went horribly wrong from there. the top billowed out at the bottom and fit like a circus tent, instantly adding a good 50 pounds to my frame. this was such a disappointment, as the pattern is beautiful and the fabric is high quality.",0
"It is a little pricey for what it is, but i love it so much that i am keeping it. i am normally size 4-6 and the s fits great. the rope straps are just adorable!",1
"This is a really well made, great looking blouse. the details are charming. i like that it is a good weight, not too sheer. the 3/4 sleeves are perfect. i ordered a medium and it is a good fit overall. so glad i put it in my shopping cart to try. it's a keeper!",1
"I tried on the xs and the shoulder are fit, but the body seemed so wide on me, it took me over... i don't know if xxs would have worked, but it is not available (and petite either). fabric is soft enough for denim, color is nice, overall, really pretty dress, just unfortunately big.

and i have wide shoulders.

"I think when this is new, it runs big, and then shrinks to the right size. that's what it did for me anyway. it did shrink after one wash, but not significantly. i bought it in m and feel it stayed within that range. super cute with shorts - airy, light. love the white. ordering another color!",1
"I ordered one of each color in size xl. the fit is true to size. it matches the model's photos. there's a lot of material so it's flowy. but, it shrunk with air-drying. the colors are very pretty in person. the white is bright. i decided to keep mine even though they're truthfully, unflattering to wear. the way the sleeves are slightly gathered and cut, make my shoulders & arms look huge. i don't have the shape to pull this off. but, for wearing at home in the summer, they're worth having. the m",0
"I tried on this shirt in the small and the xxs - both were ridiculously wide. they were also both cut really short - the peplum basically started right below my boobs, though the small was maybe a little bit longer than the eex. the stripes are really cute, the cut is just very strange. 

for reference, the black and white is the small, the taupe is the xxs.",0
"Bought this shirt because i loved the cut and the stripes. had little to no shape to it. some may think it runs big but it appears that is the look this top is going for. i feel like being short, i just looked kind of dumpy on me. fabric is nice but borders on see through. it was just ok....nothing exciting.",0
"Pros: pretty, nicely made.

cons: the fabric is stiffer than i was expecting, and the blouse cuts in under the arms. (i don't mean that it is tight or digs in, but it cuts in; you can't tell in the angle of the photo.) the blouse is short as well, and, as i am curvy, it really stuck out all around at the waist. worth trying on if you have a straighter figure.",0
"The quality and fabric are fabulous but it's just too voluminous for my figure (5'8"", 155 lbs), would look great on someone more slender.",0
"Material is nice. design would be so great if it didn't fit so large! i am 5'4"" 118lbs, athletic build. the dress could be belted i think (a very slim girl at retailer did this), but it is not worth $158 in my opinion. if on sale i might keep it due to the hastle of returning it, however, it is not ""flowy."" it fits okay in the shoulders, almost too loose, and the rest looks like a potato sack. so disappointed!!",0
"I bought the green and white and waiting to see how these wash based on previous reviews. they are definitely not figure flattering and make you a bit boxy. you could belt it, but i won't i'll just wear for errands and lounging, better than my sports tees! i bought mediums because if it shrinks a tad, the small might be too short in the arms and i wanted a bit more arm coverage.",1
"I got this in black and it's a great basic t-shirt- the v-neck is just right in depth, and the material is very soft and lightweight. the fit is good. the back is long, which can be good or not-so-good depending on how you want to wear it. i really like the la t shirts because the material has a nice soft drape and they seem to fit exceptionally well.",1
"I just bought this top in size medium and i love it. super comfortable and flowy. if you want to dry it in the machine, just put cold air and it won't shrink. don't use hot air...",1
"The photos online make it look like a comfortable, relaxed, lightweight early fall/spring cardigan. when it arrived it looked very wrinkly and there is no ""shimmer"" as far as i can tell. i tried using my steamer to get some of the wrinkles out, but it didn't work. it looks too rumpled and i don't want to wear something that looks like i just rolled out of bed.",0
"This is one of my absolute favorite dresses of the season! fun, flirty and fashionable! i wore it with a chunky necklace, floppy hat and sandals one time and with wedges and dangly earrings the other time. it is a must own dress!",1
I so wanted to keep this sweater but the invisible metallic threads that give the sweater its crinkled appearance are super scratchy and irritating. it definitely requires a long sleeved top to prevent the irritation as shown in the online photo. it is lightweight and i planned to wear it over sleeveless summer tops/dresses. i have averaged size arms and there was plenty of upper arm room. in fact extra room is designed into the sleeves. one plus for those with upper arm fit concerns. the lower,0
"I ordered this in tan and white, but ended up returning it. the material is a bit thin (but soft). the shape of the top was decent, i didn't think it was too boxy but i didn't like how the seams looked on the sides. ultimately i didn't think it was worth the price.",0
Nice stretchy shirt. nothing special so i wouldn't pay more than sale price.,1
Purchased this top in the store on sale. love the material. very soft and comfortable. love the black and white combination. i am petite so the top is a great length on me. i can see that if you are tall it might be to short.,1
"I received this tank today and i fell in love with it immediately! i am petite (5'3""/36b/108 lbs) and purchased this in the only size left, which was a small. yes....it is very billowy (but i do a half tuck into my pants and that solves the problem perfectly and looks great!!) i have very well toned arms and the way this is cut just accentuatea this! yay!! the fabric is soft and the overall look is super feminine!!! so very happy with my purchase! plan on wearing with jeans shorts/cropped jeans/",1
"Fits like a dream. i have a thick middle and tend to have problems with anything that flairs out, so i was so happy that it hung beautifully on me. even though i wasn't really looking for a sweater to take on a trip to europe in a few weeks, i bought it on the spot. i bought it in neutral which is the only color the store had and after seeing the darker color am happy with it. i love the belt since most sweaters don't have anything to close them and the belt lays perfectly as well.",1
"This is just okay for me. the top is soft and surprisingly flattering, especially from the side, but the front rides up and the neckline never lays flat. it washes well and the tan/white combo is cute, but a little transparent.",0
"The quality of this top is wonderful. thick enough to prevent see-through, but thin enough to create a beautiful drape. the fringe details are lovely. the top is slightly roomy (ranks between ""true to size"" and ""runs large,"" i.e., leaves room in the back when i clasp my hands together and stretch them out in front of me), but not really enough to size up. i'm 5'-4"", 120 lbs., athletic build, and the small fits well. my only issue with the aesthetic is that the pattern of the lace on the upper pa",1
"This is definitely a cute top! i am 5'1"" 34a, and bought the extra small. it fits well, very flowy. a little shorter than i like, but it still looks cute. it's thin, but soft and comfortable. i wore it just like the model, with my long jeans and some wedge sandals and it looks great for a spring day!",1
"I got this shirt because of the flutter sleeves, and i'm not disappointed. it is a classic t, with that little bit of an edge due to the sleeves. it is not fitted, which is what i was looking for. it also covers my bum, which i don't always like hanging out there. in all, it's perfect for my needs. i got the turquoise one and i may get the white one too!",1
"Gorgeous sleeves, flattering neckline...and a voluminous torso. i loved the fit of the top portion so much, i decided to buy it, knowing it would require alteration. the seamstress removed a *significant* amount of bulk and added vintage buttons to clasp the inverted pleat. i find many of these ""easy breezy"" tops create a shapeless look. extra volume in both the front and back creates a needlessly rotund profile. despite excellent posture, i looked both hunched and pregnant in the unaltered silh",0
"Easy to wear with black or grey. i will wear as a work jacket, not necessarily just an outwear piece",1
"Loved the sweater and the sale price was great, but i could not take the shedding! even after just trying it on the first time, my jeans and top had shedding all over them. this was 2 minutes, i could not imagine what i would look like if i wore it all day. had to return.",0
This sweater is the perfect sweater except for one thing.....it sheds everywhere. i can simply pick up the sweater and shake it in one hand and 40 large pieces of lint go everywhere on the ground and on you. if you like dark jeans- don't purchase. before i walked out of the store- the salesperson had to use a delineator on me- it was hysterical. sheds so much,0
"I ordered this to arrive at my store and was so excited to try it on. it was soft and cuddly, but a little baggy under the arms, and it shed everywhere. underwhelmed.",0
"I do not love these pants. while the fabric is nice, they make me look rather dumpy. i highly recommend the essential taper pant instead, which has beautiful tapering legs and made me look more slender. these pants make me look like i've put on 20 pounds and they also make me look rather squat. perhaps they would look good on someone tall, but at 5' 6"" these are a miss for me!",0
"Beautiful top but the angles emphasized my widest fluffy bits in an unattractive way. i ordered size large. the material, fabric and lace are pretty and well done. my arms looked huge too. and the piece under the arm hit below my bra and it was clearly visible by a couple inches. i carry my weight in my mid section and am short waisted. think this would look best on taller, thinner bods.",0
"I bought this for an upcoming late-september seaside trip because it looked like it would be warm enough for cooler nights, but not too warm because of the open weave. i just received it yesterday, and i adore it. i got the pink color and was really torn between the green and the pink. i was hoping the pink would look more beige from far away (per one of the other reviews) and i was happy that it does. up close you can really see the pink, but from an arm's length away or more, it looks beige wi",1
"This vest looked so cute online. what you can't see however, is the vertical seaming under the arms does not have any fringe (about 3"" wide). that material in the seaming area looked like cheap polyester and it pulled slightly near the side pockets so it didn't lay nicely. also the top of the vest where it comes together also does not lay well and it falls awkwardly open - again showing the cheapy material that it's lined with. fits true to size. i usually wear a s/m in retailer and purchased the",0

Purchased this item on sale-received it and it had two huge holes on the side.not possible to repair. very disappointed in lack of quality control. :(,0
I can't wait for it to get colder so i can wear this out. love the ochre color paired with the maroon faux fur lapel. i especially love the detail at the pocket edges. very well made. the faux fur is luxuriously soft and removable. this will go great with denim and long skirts. the wool is a bit stiff in my opinion but that's okay. this will make a great addition to your autumn and winter closet. most of my outerwear are blacks or dark blues or dark greys so it's nice to be able to wear a bit of,1
"I had high hopes for this top but sadly it was not meant to be. it was tts (i'm 5""3 and usually wear a small). but the material was horribly scratchy. both the body of the top as well as the sleeves. and the design isn't all that flattering. it made me look really wide at the bottom and i definitely am not in real life!",0
Just lovely!  gift for my daughter who has two other vegan leather jackets from retailer!,1

"This top looked really cute. when i received
it the fit was not flattering. it is snug on top and very loose
on the bottom with an excess amount of material. it made me
look very disproportionate. i returned it.",0
"This is an adorable top. sweet back detail, thin material but soft. the top is two sizes too big, i'm normally a large and a small fits. i know it is supposed to be baggy but the large was inches too big under each arm. size down and petite ladies will be sized out. love this though.",1

"I anticipated receiving this skirt as i love a longer pencil skirt and this looks beautiful. i opened it, tried it on, sent it back...it is well made but has too many negatives. first, it is very thick. i ordered size 6 (5'2"", 140 lbs.). the size was good, but it is so thick that it adds lots of extra fluff around the waist and abdomen. it is also very stretchy and fits in an unflattering way. finally, and most importantly, it has a back and front vent and both are vented all the way up to the c",0

"This is an average top. i thought it would be a good work shirt (my office is very causal), but it was just too loungey looking. fit is true to size. the fabric is thin- a little see through. not worth $108 in my opinion. i returned it.",0
"Maybe it's because i'm 40, but this top was underwhelming. i felt like it was a cheap tee with a big, obnoxious bow on the back. it does look cute on the model, so maybe it's a ""younger"" top. i would have felt silly wearing it.",0
"I love this jacket. it is a perfect moto style jacket without being overly aggressive looking because it doesn't have the silver hardware. instead all the hardware is black which gives it a cleaner minimalist look. it is not super heavy. it also has a cute blue and white striped lining, which if you turn up the sleeves adds a surprise. i bought it in a size small so that it was comfortable and i would be able to put a light sweater under it if i wanted to. i generally take an xs or sometimes a s",1

"This is a very cute and unique cropped jacket. the attention to detail is excellent. i am normally a small but had to size down to an xs as the style is a bit boxy and to make it more fitted/tailored, an xs looked better. i am 5'5"" 118 lbs, 34c, slim athletic build. it is a chic alternative to a cardigan on a cooler day.",1
Love this top b/c it's very feminine! got this at 20% off and it's very flattering!,1
"Just got this top and i love it! it's color is more saturated in person, which i like. more of a pinky-purple. very sweet and feminine. i still have a bit of a ""mommy tummy"" and the style hides that pretty well. it's very soft and comfortable as well. overall, happy with this top :)",1
"I am not sure why the first reviewed hated this dress so much. i personally like that it looks a tad retro. length is shorter, but not mini or too short. i ordered the xxs p and it looked ok on me (and i am older). the colors are fun and appropriate for fall, or winter, the sparkle (golden thread) can bring this dress into the holiday season (and beyond). i love the turtleneck part, only thing is it is really high, and the embroidery gets a little lost in it (top of the design) feel is thick, no",1
"Love the pattern, i thought i would be hosed and need a petite, but the regular xs fits nicely. it is on the thiner side, so great for summer (office is cooold)
love subtle squares, glad they still had my size at sale! :-)",1
I really love this top. it looks so sweet and beautiful and is perfect for dressing up a pair of jeans. if you are on the short size it may be a little long so keep that in mind. i love it!,1
"I ordered this top based on the photos. this looked unique and beautiful, plus i've loved past designs by this brand. i thought this would be nice for summer. there isn't a straight-on view of the front of the top for a reason. the model is turned to the side and there is one black flower that stands out below her chest, away from the border of the rest of the flowers. the flower looks kind of like a bee. i believe she is either wearing a size larger or pulling down the top to mask the problem.",0
"Beautiful sweater, very delicate fabric, unique design, but it runs very small. i usually wear a m, but ordered a large based on the previous review hoping that would do the trick. the sizing, along with being long waisted isn't a good combination. unfortunately, i'm returning the sweater.",1
"This is a beautiful shirt, however the cut and drape were off. i'm only 104 pounds, but this top made me look pregnant. the fabric jutted out at the front. it's a shame, because it really is lovely. i sent it back.",0
"I so wanted to love this dress, but the bell sleeves were enormous! if you're standing completely still with your arms down they look cool, but if you move your arms at all it looks like you have wings. the rest of the dress was beautiful, though, and a flattering swingy shape even on an hourglass/pear shaped figure. i would recommend sizing down, as the dress runs large.",0
"I saw someone else wearing this sweater and had to find it! i'm 5'5""and 118 lbs and ordered the small. the back of the sweater hits a few inches above my back pockets. i've been wearing it with a tank underneath and it's been the perfect sweater for fall weather. i was worried the poncho effect might make it hard to wear this sweater with a jacket but it's actually less bulky than other ""real"" sweaters i have.",1
Beautiful sweater - cool enough to wear on a florida evening and it will be perfect for vacation. the sleeves hit right above the wrist bone (exactly as shown on the model) and i really like that. sheer fabric but still a sweater - you will need a cami or tank underneath. can't wait to wear it!,1
"I just received this sweater in the mail and when i first opened the packaging i questioned as to whether or not they sent to correct color. be aware that this ""brown"" is actually gray. i checked the site to see if it was even offered in gray, which it is not. additionally, the sweater is quite a bit shorter than the picture on the model implies. i still love it, the comfy coziness of it will be great for fall in new england. looking forward to wearing it.",1
"I have always bought interesting, pretty, wearable dresses for my daughters at retailer. now the dresses are just retro funky. sad to see.",0
"The pictures do not do this blouse justice. the pleat in the front is so flattering that i did a double take (this detail doesn't come through the images, which is a shame as it is the most beautiful element of this blouse). the collar that stands up just enough is something unexpected, and the sleeve length is fun yet sophisticated. i am madly in love with this blouse and highly recommend it to anyone. 

it is extremely see-through...so unless you want to show off your nips, you should expect",1
"I kept this top, only because i needed a plain black tank, but there is nothing special about it. i found it a bit large and thin cheap material.",0
"This is really a lovely top, but the color online is not quite what the color actually is in person. this was a find in my store today and it is a little more lilac than the picture shows. the cut is extremely flattering and the fabric is very soft as is the case with most one september items. the one recommendation that i have for this is that because the main fabric is a soft knit, the proper undergarments are really needed. i tried it with a lace bra and you could see a lot the details of the",1
I really wanted to love this top the material and pattern are lovely but the fit is strange. it looks like a maternity top on me and as another reviewer said it is right across the back but loose at arms and midsection. for the price i returned it.,0
"Runs huge! returning the m for a s; normally a m top and s bottom in sizing. very soft, wonderful colour.",1
"This was my favorite shirt before i ordered it .... i absolutely couldn't wait to wear it.  but i was so disappointed.  at 5'2"" and 120 i have a athletic frame ... the small was tight in the shoulders but had so much extra fabric that i felt lost.  i wasn't wearing the shirt .... it was wearing me.",0
"I love this top! was not immediately in love with it when i saw it on line but when i saw it in store the other day and got to try it on i fell in love!! the colors at a little deeper in person, which i loved! it is a traditional soft flannel top! it is fitted and flattering! a must have for fall/winter!!",1
"The photos don't look it, but the one i received was a cropped length. the bottom of the sweater's longest parts didn't even reach the top of my mid-rise pants. and i'm 5'3"" so it wasn't that the model is a lot shorter than me unless their models are 4' tall. 

disappointed since i wasted my retailer discount on this!",0
"This shirt runs true to size. i'm an xl and it fit perfectly! that is my first reason for loving it. it is super soft and so comfortable i don't want to take it off! the trim inside the cuffs and button line is navy with large white polka dots, which i love. the ruffle of the shoulders i'm not super wild on but it does give it a touch of different. the color of the photo is very accurate. i love the muted pink in the plaid.",1
"I spend a lot of time on the retailer website. it never occurred to me to try this dress. a salesperson suggested it in the store and i tried it on. it is really cute on. i bought a thrift store denim jacket to throw over it. the only con is the sleeves. i am 5'3' and my arms are not very long. the bell sleeves are a little crazy on me, but they will be hidden under the jacket.",1
"What a pity! this blouse has a beautiful design, however it doesn't fit well on the body. it's not really a size problem, it's just not a well fitted blouse. the color is very deceptive, it looks white on the picture, but it's actually pink. i'm probably going to return it.",0
"Saw this in the greenville, sc store, and it caught my eye. i ordered a petite a week later, and i adore it. nice embroidery. a little sparkle. the sleeves are voluminous, but it makes me feel sassy.",1
"Picked this up on sale - was on the fence about the bright reddish/orange coloration, but it really says summer and goes so easily with multiple summer pieces. it is generously cut and made very well. i've worn it on cooler/rainy days and it really brightens everything up. best part is that it launders well too.",1
This top has a bit of a retro flare but so adorable on. looks really cute with a pair of faded boot cut jeans.,1
"Love this dress. from the great fabric (soft yet substantial) that's similar to sweater material, to the amazing detail of the flower design (it's really so unique and i mean that in a good way!), to the color (a tan with gold flecking), and lastly to the really flattering fit, not to mention those retro bell sleeves!  all around a fun dress! it was true to size and not too short, hitting my 5'4"" height about 2"" above my knees.",1
"This top is a mix of materials - a silk and more of a t shirt material. i purchased for dressier wear but the material makes it more casual. i like the sale price so i'm keeping!  size down, runs a tad loose.",1
"I'm an xl in retailer tops, and the xl fit as expected in this blouse. however, the elastic cinched in such a way under my bust that it did not look flattering. the cut in the sleeves hang open too much for me and makes it more of a costume. i also had issues that the chiffon type sleeves did not match the color of the knit fabric used in the rest of the blouse. the blouse is a good quality, but there were too many other issues for me to keep it.",0
This jacket has cute details. i like the front pockets and color. it has no shape and is about 1 size bigger than marked. i felt like a sack of potatoes in it.,0
"I really wanted to love this. sadly, the first thing i noticed was how tight it was in the arms and across the back (size up maybe even two sizes). secondly, it's see through! a top like this looses it's finesse to me once i can see my pant line and bra. it's very difficult to do the three buttons in the back yourself and finally, good luck taking it off without getting make up all over the neckline. someone dubbed it the ""poor man's pineapple top."" i couldn't agree more, sigh. i really did want",0
"This jacket was a little shorter than i had expected, but i still really enjoy the cut and fit of it.",1
I tried this on in the store. i'm usually a 6 in tops but it was tight across the chest. i sized up to an 8 and it was still tight. i would have considered the 10 but with the 8 there was too much fabric on the bottom. overall design and material were good but the sizing was off.,1
Ordered this in my normal size large in taupe. the jacket fit tts. the length was cropped but just long enough (hit just below my belly button) to feel comfortable and not too short for my 5'9 height. the quality feels good.,1
"Ugh, i was so disappointed with this shirt. i was so excited when i saw it online and thought it would be a perfect summer shirt with the light colors and the flower print. unfortunately it falls flat and i understand now why they don't have a straight on photo of the shirt, its very plain and lays very unflatteringly. it's definitely missing something in the front. i typically wear a small to an extra small and i ordered this in an extra small and would have needed an xxs if i hadn't returned i",0
"I've wondered abt this swtr but hesitated to order being it has dolman sleeves. decided to wait for it to come in at the local store. yesterday i spotted it in the store & tried on the orange, labeled 'red' online. i was really looking for the 'cream' but the store did not have it. well, the orange is really much prettier in person. fit is perfect in my usual size s. overall body fit & length is generous, sleeves are wrist length & i'm only 5'3"". most likely the sleeves will be shorter on taller",0
It doesn't work with me only because i have very skinny arm. i can not handle the arm part of the dress. it is still very pretty though. i would keep it if i fit the arm :(,1
"I was on the fence about this top, because i don't typically do longer tunic styles. however, it really is quite lovely. i paired it with long jeans, wedge sandals, and a delicate necklace - so pretty! it fits very nicely and i was surprised at how much i liked the length.",1
The print doesn't necessarily works for everybody.,0
This top is beautiful and i really wanted to be able to keep it - i've tried it on 3 times. it is not for big-chested girls (34ddd) - it hangs like i'm 20 months pregnant because the top area lands on top of my chest. sadly this will be going back. it is beautiful and flowing and a perfect weight.,0
"I ordered this in blue, and loved the color. i'm not typically into the flowing top style, but i tried a few items on my last order, this being one. it's unseamed at the bottom, which was my primary reason for returning it - i couldn't see that in the photo online - but if that is your style, this item is good quality, soft, comfortable material, and a great spring or fall blue.",1
Love!! so comfy! i wish they came in more colors. i'd order every one!!,1
"I wear jeans so much, therefore i love to a variety in color. these jeans are so comfortable. they are like wearing sweat pants, but they truly keep their shape so well. i bought the red, which is a year around red, kind of a bright apple red. i will definitely be buying another pair of these ag jeans.",1
This top is a little big but i sized down and liked it a lot. can be casual or can dress it up with a statement necklace. perfect fall shirt,1
"This is a crop top but super boxy and wide. i expected it to be more fitted in the waist. since it sits out away a from the body a lot, it was not flattering. i also felt the stitching to be a bit matronly for me. too bad as i am having such a hard time finding tops and i'm willing to pay full price for something that works.",0
"Bought these for the color however these just did not work for me. the 26 was too small and the 27 was baggy. i'm 5'3 and typically wear a 26. beautiful color and good denim. if you are looking for a looser fit, more of a straight leg fit...this is a good jean with a fun pop of color.",0
Got this for my wife for christmas and she is very happy with it. the size is perfect for her and she regularly orders things as a medium from this store.,1
Really liked the fan pattern and the cut was cute and flattering.  but the material is thin and all the edges are not finished and look frayed making the shirt look and feel cheap.  would have kept if thicker material and the edges were finished.  not worth full price,0
"I also agree with the other reviewers that it's important to try on a couple due to pattern differences. this dress has a beige base- the photo is a little misleading. i ended up returning it because the colors didn't do much for me, i think they look great on the model but that's because the beige doesn't blend into her at all. i also think it's a little overpriced for what the dress is- a great summer day dress.",1
"Love these jeans. fit great. i've had other colored denim from ag that stretched out too much, were too thin, but these are a nice thicker fabric. i ordered the red and the moss, and the red fit a little better than the moss in the same size. not sure if the dye process affects the fabric but the red pair seemed a bit more substantial. the moss is great too though, so i may keep both.",1
"Although the material of this top is beautiful and the quality is nice as well, it really did not lay right on me. i'm a 34d, and i got my usual size in a small. the arm holes were a bit too big, the waist was too wide and it overall looked like a bib on me.",0
I was so excited to try these on at my local retailer. i'm so glad i did before i ordered them online because i found the fit to be totally off. the pants bulged around my hips and looked very awkward. they were also not as soft as i expected them to be.,0
"I love these pants. like, obsessively love, like didn't want to take them off to wash them, love. annnnd i wish i hadn't because they came out of a delicate cycle cold water wash with a huge part of the leg seam ripped apart like a spider web. maybe i just got a bad pair, but i wasn't prepared to have to patch them after one wash for the price.",0
"Love this blouse--looks like a fp blouse yet a bit cheaper and well made! looks feminine and edgy on. may size out for taller gals b/c it is a bit on the shorter length. i am 5'5"" and the length is just right on me untucked. the lace on the sleeves are gorgeous and neckline is not too high!",1
"If you have anything larger than an a cup, this shirt will likely not fit right. it is very pretty but the seem on the front runs directly in the middle of the chest. it literally runs right through the center of the breasts. what were they thinking? if it had been three inches higher or lower, it would have been perfect. for reference, i'm approximately 105lb and have a dd cup.",0
"I loved the idea of this dress, but i find that it isn't very flattering. i think the arm holes are actually very interesting, but i'm 5'5 and 135lbs, and the dress made me look fat and gave me no shape at all. maybe it would look better on a different body type.

the material is soft, but a bit stuffy and i could tell it would give me crazy static in my hair.",0
"I got this dress and think it's just great. it's a bit formal, but a bit whimsical at the same time. i really disagree with others said about the opening along the arms. i think they are barely noticeable but are nice surprise. this is a perfect california winter dress. i could see how a woman in colder parts of the country might not appreciate the slits on the arms but i think it's nice to show a little skin in a conservative way. i plan to wear it to a classical music concert soon. and i got i",1
"I laughed to myself  as i pulled these jeans on in the dressing room, expecting them to look ridiculous. instead, i was amazed at how well they fit, how cool they looked, and how comfortable they were (two sizes smaller than my usual).  yes, this 66 yo woman rocked these jeans!  i love the intricate whiskering, raw leg opening, and worn, dirty wash.  usually i do not like the dirty look, but this is good dirty. try them on:  you may just fall for them.",1
I loved this dress and i really loved it more after i bought it on sale. i am 5'3 100lbs and the only thing that bothers me is that the arm of it are somewhat tight when i reach out to get something. other wise the dress is great and get a lot of compliments on it. i paired it with black nylons and black plain leather booties and it looked great!,1
"I have been looking for flares that are not tight through the thigh and these are definitely them...but for me they were so long that to hem them would ruin the style of the pants. i'm 5'5 and have long legs but i would need a high heel to maintain the intended style, and that's not what i was looking for. otherwise, beautiful.",1
Love these jeans! the material is soft and very flattering on the hips.,1
"This is exactly as pictured, and fits as it does on the model in the last picture. my only hang-up is that it's a little pricey for a t-shirt, the fabric is standard t-shirt material, not stiff but also not super soft which i was hoping for. my hubby had no idea what the pattern was til i pointed it out :)",1
"I love this dress! it is a very casual and loose fit, which makes it super comfortable. i highly recommend it since it is versatile for fall and spring and can be styled quite a few ways.",1
"I purchased this tee in the blue and it is so very cute. its such a soft thin tee and a delight to wear on these hot summer days. i went with xs on this one and i still have plenty of room.. i have paired it with jean shorts, capris and it goes really well with the pilcro hypen chino shorts.",1
Beautiful color and soft texture. this piece is flattering and can be worn in many seasons.,1
"I agree with others that the shape is not perfect, it does billow a bit by the hips. but the xxs petite (someone returned) was good on me. length was perfect, sleeve were not too tights. (30dd, 26.5 in waist, 35 in hips, 115 lbs)
colors are subdued, making the jacket more neutral. keeping in mind for later...",1
"I was so excited to order this beautiful coat.  it does seem well made and is very soft.  unfortunately, the fit is completely off and is overall large.  i ordered a small, as this coat appears slightly more snug on top, a-line on the bottom, with three buttons.  i am 5'6"" and weigh approximately 145.  i was expecting this coat to be body-skimming.  instead it was overall large and the bottom of the coat awkwardly flared.  the  pleat on the back is unflattering.  sadly going back.",0
"The fit is so bad and the construction is very poor. i'm 5'1'', 100 lbs, ordered xxs petite. 

first of all, when i button this, there is extreme gaping going on. the vest runs narrow, yet tall?it shifts up my torso if i move at all, making the gaping even worse.

the ""skirt"" at the bottom is made of a very cheap, thin, slightly sheeny material that you would find at a flea market. it arrived unbelievably wrinkled and crumpled, and it was just so thin. it did not meet as closely in the middl",0
"I tried this on in the store and it fit like a tent on me. it doesn't help that i'm 5'1"" and the store didn't have the petite sizes. maybe on a teller person it would work better. or maybe if i had been able to try the petite size it would have more wearable. it is a comfy style and the natural fiber is a plus. i have another holding horses dress that i love which also runs large. i did not mark this as ""runs large"" because the sleeves are more true to size while the bodice is very billowy. i wo",0
"I was immediately drawn to this top in the catalog. when my local retailer had it in stock and in my size, i tried it on. it fit so well - the front wasn't too low and the back was fantastic with its multiple straps. i wore it the same week to a dinner with friends. i like the multiple prints and the navy blue edging. i bought the turquoise necklace too because it topped off the look so well. the fabric is silky but washable. the top is very well made and fun to wear.",1
"Initially, i bought this because i liked the color and style of this trench coat. i thought it could look very chic and polished. the problem was it was too large and too wrinkly. i'm 5'2 (115 lbs) and ordered an xs because petite sizes were unavailable. but i realize that a petite xs would've been a better fit. also the sleeves were too long even with an xs. i've already returned the product.",0
"I need t-shirts, these seem cute. a small runs loose, but it's comfortable and it does fit. i am turned off by the little side slits on all of this brand's printed tees. if i want to do a partial tuck to give myself a waist, because these shirts are cut generously, the little slits just throw the whole look off. i tried a few in the store, but left them all there.",0
"I had high hopes for this coat, but it was a miss for me. while the wool is soft and not itchy, the colors are a lot duller in person and the embroidery looks messy.  also, the fit runs large with an unflattering poof in the back where the pleat is located.  i thought about keeping it since i liked how soft the wool was, but alas, i just could not get over the poor tailoring.  for reference i am usually a pxxs ( 5ft2in 105 lbs) and it was big.",0
"I thought the colors would be brighter and i didn't realize the lace would be see through. i returned it because it was also shorter that i expected. but overall it was a nice dress, just not for me.",0
Love the fabric. comfortable to wear with jeans or a dress. good for those cool fall mornings.,1
"I've been stalking this top online and finally went into the store today to see it.  i'm so glad i did!  the colors are very vibrant and the material is soft and very lightweight.  the cut covers a regular bra pretty well (a big plus!) and makes my arms look good!  i can't wait to wear this, it will be a perfect dressy top for the higher heat days!",1
"I love this top, the beachy print is very cute. my only complaint is that it does run large, it is definitely not a fitted t-shirt; and bought the medium and it's a little baggy on me. i'm hoping that a wash and dry will shrink it up a bit. if not, that's okay, still very cute.",1
"I like this layer for fall for many reasons. first of all, the color is a beautiful fall color. the design of the vest is flattering when wore with skinny jeans or leggings. the weight of the vest is perfect for the cooler weather. it is not too heavy, it's fairly lightweight. i am a size 6 and the small fit perfectly.",1
"I just think this dress is so cute! i love it with booties! 
here are the fit details: i'm 5'4 1/2"" and the front of the dress hits just above my knees. (i was concerned that it would be too short for my lifestyle based on the photo). the sleeves roll up and have a tab to button, however the button is very low. therefore, the sleeve rolls up not mid arm, but actually about three inches above my wrist! (it's still super cute, just nowhere near my elbow. just letting you know).
final detail that",0
"The material is velvety smooth, and not quite so pink as pictured on the website. more of a dusty brown rose. well made, nice fit. flattering on my petite frame. a wonderful third piece to complete or elevate an outfit.",1
"I absolutely love this vest. it fits extremely well and falls nicely. i find the collar/lapel billows or flaps out and away from the interior of the vest and i wish they were sewn or secured down. when you tie the string around your waist, the lapel doesn't lay flat, but if you style it like the online model and tie the string off to tighten around your waist, you get a very flattering look. the color and fabric is great quality and really nice in person. i'm overall really happy with this vest.",1
"These embroidered jeans are very nice. they also exist in a lighter wash which i prefer because it shows off the embroidery better. the embroidery is dark navy which is almost not visible in these darker jeans. i guess if you like something very subtle these jeans are for you. i personally would have like a more contrasting color either white or red for the embroidery. these jeans are loose and expand with wear, it is perfectly ok to size down.",1
I had to call so many stores to track this shirt down and in the end it wasn't worth it. i got an xs and it was quite baggy. i never buy petite shirts because i feel like they are too short but in this case i think the shirt would have been perfect in whatever the smallest petite size is. for someone who's bigger i'd definitely check this shirt out.,1
"Looked good in pictures. i even ordered an xxs petite and it was huge! although the sweater has interesting textures and is very beautiful, it is very awkward and poor fit. will be sending back.",0
This was just not flattering for me--looked too much like a maternity dress. i can't really do a belted waist so perhaps that would make this dress more versatile for someone else. i was sorry to have to return because it goes well with sandals and boots!,0
"Love it. got a lot of compliments with it.
buy it, it's worth it especially with the sale price right now.",1
"The top is cute, but when i received it, it did not feel like cotton. the tag says 100% viscose. i hope retailer can be more accurate with fabric content in the future! on the plus side, the return was no problem.",0
"These relaxed fit jeans are super soft. they do run a size large, i am a size 26 in the stilt style and the 25 in these fit well with a little ""room"".",1
My favorite jeans i have ever purchased! they fit just right. i wear them everywhere.,1
"I'm so disappointed. the dress looked lovely in the box, but when i started to unbutton it to try it on, two buttons split in half! it's going right back.",0
"The peplum for this time hit me in the middle of my rib cage, not at my natural waist, so it looked very odd when it flared out with the peplum so high up. i am busty so it's possible this would not be the case for everyone but i generally can wear peplum tops with no problem. i was disappointed to return it, the fabric was very nice and the concept behind the shirt was a good one.",0
Really wanted to love this top but the proportion was not right for my body type. also the print with the silhouette was a bit too country bumpkin for me.,1
"I love this shirt! it is classic and elegant. it is versatile and can go with lots of different things. be mindful, it is see-through so you must wear a tank underneath. i got it in white and it can be dressed up or down. i like how the sleeves are slightly longer than your average shirt. definitely recommend.",1
"I'm 5'5"" and i think fairly proportioned (120 lbs, 34b) and the peplum hit well above my waist. since having kids i'm a little obsessive about avoiding any shirt that could double as maternity... and this struck me as one. it's a cute too, but once it's on i don't feel it's very flattering.",0
"As soon as i pulled these pants from their packaging, i feel in love with them. the fabric was so soft - i could not wait to get them on...yeah, that was not going to happen! i could not pull them on - not even a little bit! these pants run incredibly small. i ordered them twice: once in my regular size, and again in a larger size. unfortunately, i am sized out of these beauties.",0
The design and quality were great. i really wanted them to fit but they ran large. i'm 5'4 and 120 lbs and orderd the small. unfortunately the fit seemed off as well and i won't be trying a size down. the waist and hips were huge but the thigh area was fitted enough that a smaller size would have been awkward. sadly these went back.,0
"Absolutely adore this dress. details, fabric and deep pockets. here is the caveat at least for me. i am a typical size 6 and ordered the dress in a size 8 for a little looser, casual fit. the 8 is so small i can barely place over my shoulders and cannot button. i have reordered a size 12 and 14. perhaps the dress i received is not tagged properly. so disappointed as the item is on backorder.",1
"I had been looking at the dresses and jumpsuits from this designer for a while and decided to order this jumpsuit. i'm usually an extra small in jumpsuits, and wasn't sure to get the 0petite or 2petite. i'm 5'3 and about 115 lbs and the 2 petite is perfect in the legs and waist, but a little wide across the chest (i'm a 32c). the material is soft and feels very nice and like good quality. it's perfect for dressing up a little in the summer and i'm going to think of ways to transition it to the f",1
"I saw this dress online, and i thought it was perfectly cute! however, once i tried it on at home, it just didn't work. one of the buttons broke in half as i tried unbuttoning, and once i got it on, the dress was so small that the cuffs cut off circulation to my forearm. (i'm 5'7'' and ~126 lbs and purchased in size 2). i didn't even try buttoning all the way. i took it back, and i don't even think i want a larger size. the buttons are just too fragile.",0
"The cotton, the print, and the online presentation of this dress are beautiful, i ordered right away! but there are some discrepancies. the shoulders have a ""puff"" to them that i don't notice on the model, and that doesn't flatter athletic shoulders. the buttons are (cheap) difficult to button. the waist sits much lower on the model than it must on anyone else, it's nearly empire on me. and, there is a lot more volume in the skirt of the dress than is shown in any photo. because the dress is tig",1
Although beautiful colors this eyelet dress is quite heavy and the buttons have no give- one of them literally cracked when i tried to unbutton it. unbuttoning it was difficult due to the tight weave. it just misses the mark and will be going back.,0
This top is great for those days when you have nothing to wear. just throw this on and get ready for the compliments!,1
"This top looks better on than on the hanger. i've been looking for a feminine plaid top and this is the one! it's a flirty and innocent look in one. i would say size up. it runs a little tight around the upper arm, shoulders area when stretching arms out. i normally wear a size 2-4 depending on the top and the 6 felt better.",1
"I am 5'4 and 120 lbs and ordered a size 0. the dress fit perfectly in the shoulders and arms and below the waist, but i could barely fit my 32a size chest in the dress! the other reviewers are not kidding about the chest area being very narrow. i have had to order a size 2 instead. we'll see if that works.",1
"Really like this dress but.....
the dress is lined in a heavy fabric and weighs a lot for a summer dress
worst of all there is no chance at all of getting the buttons through the button holes.
impossible!
has to go back",0
"Super cute, casual top. i'm usually a medium and this fit perfectly (5'9"" 145 lbs). it's not quite as long as it is on the model, but cute nonetheless.",1
"I saw this top online and loved it. i wasn't sure about sizing and because i don't live near a store i decided to order two sizes. i'm 5'8"" and typically wear an 8 or medium in tops. the 8 in this top though was much too tight in the shoulders. i sized up to a 10 and it fit beautifully!",1
"I am a brand loyal ag fan. best washes, best pocket placement and these are no exception. they do run a little big. i usually wear a 26 or 27 in the stilts depending on the fabric content. i tried these in the 26 and 25. both fit, but i went with the 25 because these will stretch at least 1/2 size. the distressing is the right amount, however i gave 4 stars because one area is directly over the knee which i don't care for. solved it by having a seamstress reinforce the back of it with a similar",1
"This is a cute dress, but the buttons are tiny and the top one cracked in half before i could even put the dress on. i can't risk the buttons breaking off while i am wearing it. especially since the dress seems designed for an a cup, anything larger will be more than those little fragile buttons can handle.",0
"I wanted to love this dress. sadly, the styling was wrong. the stripes on the bottom half did not line up with the top and the pleats didn't help. it just threw everything off and made me look distorted.",0
"I ordered this blouse as a gift for my mom. it is too pricey to live up to my expectations. it is quite sheer and the hem of the sleeves are unfinished which you can't see in the pictures. this makes a very expensive blouse look cheap. it is made of viscose and dry clean only. the material used is not on par with the price in my opinion. if it had been real silk or another natural fiber, ok. but for me this and the unfinished hem along with the price is a deal breaker for me.",0
"So pretty and flattering. it's my new favorite blouse. it's also really comfortable. i do not tuck this one in. i love the knit material makes it extra comfy and breathable. the colors are very pretty and wearable. the quality and cratsmanship are impressive. it has a straight bottom hem and slight boxy cut which i like. i am 5'3"" and weight 126 lbs. i ordered the small , but i was going go a slightly bigger comfy fit. i couldn't be happier with this purchase.",1
Love this top. got xs fits perfectly. wish it came in more designs,1
"These pants are fabulous ! i want more colors !
and i got them on sale !!",1
I tried these on in a 6 which is my usual size in bottoms that are not designer jeans and they fit ok. they were a little short waisted but i have a long torso. sizing up to an 8 helped but then they were fairly wide in the legs. they are meant to flare out a bit i believe but it was too much for me. i like them but i don't love.,1
"This was my first time to try this brand and they fit so well and are super comfortable. i love the pockets also. i am 5'1, 108 and i got a 2p and they fit just right.",1
I put on this t-shirt and my husband said it makes you look old. he was right. i'm not sure if it's the cut or the pattern but i found it completely unflattering on my petite frame and it looked cheap too. perhaps on someone else it would look different. the pattern is overwhelming and the sleeps are a bit too look and ruched for my liking. it may look better on someone taller.,0
"One of the worst shirts i've tried in a long time. i don't know how they managed to give it a little shape on the model. in person it is sleeveless, huge, short and wide.",0
"I tried this on in the store on a whim. it is so flattering, soft, and pretty. i generally wear a size 12 and bought a l although the m might have fit, also: it's got plenty of room. the chiffon yoke is not particularly sheer and a nude bra strap is basically invisible, the jersey is adequately opaque so no camisole needed. my dimensions are about 40""  bust x 33"" waist.",1
"I tried on this jumpsuit in black and it was absolutely beautiful. i liked that it looked sort of like a tuxedo, i wore it one time and received so many compliments. when i washed it, however, it shrunk almost 1 size! the pant legs were high water. i even tried washing and restretching it because i loved the jumpsuit but it wouldn't budge, i think because rayon is not stretchable material. to my disappointment, i returned it. i really wished it would have worked out.",0
"I can't wait for our warmer weather to arrive here in minnesota so i can wear this lovely tank top. the style is so flattering, it doesn't bag out to make you look pregnant. the back yoke is solid navy blue chiffon which is a nice touch. soft fabric, drapes beautifully. the armholes are not oversized. the fabric is opaque so no camisole required.

i am 5'5"" and 120 lbs. and 36a. i purchased size small.",1
"I ordered this online and was surprised to see yellow in the pattern when it arrived. i can't see that in the online photo. i didn't like the pattern at all when i saw it for real. the shirt is very loose, fits much like the model photo (i ordered a small, 5'6 140lbs). just looks kind of frumpy and the pleat down the front makes the front hang heavily.",0
"The fabric is a nice weight knit and the top generally well made. unfortunately, the fit was enormous. i've an athletic build w/ big boobs & normally wear l in retailer tops.",0
Love it. goes well with a lot. super soft,1
"Lovely silky top (100% poly). i typically look better in more cool tones. this top is neutral enough that i could pull it off. it really has three very pretty, complimentary patterned fabrics. the front v is very deep and the arm holes are quite roomy so either size down or plan on wearing a cami to conceal cleavage and bra.",1
"I like the fabric and aesthetic of this top, and really wanted to like it, however i wish it were longer. i am a size small or med in all retailer clothes, but even the medium felt short and clingy. however that might be because i'm curvy with a long torso, so i'd definitely recommend trying this on rather than buying online!",0
"The pattern and colors are very pretty, and the material is soft and silky. i returned it, though, because it is very low-cut in the front. it comes down to between my breasts, which is not going to work for me.",0
"I am sure these pants are right for someone, just not me. i am wider in the hips, and they just were really unflatering. the fabric is very lightweight, which i wasn't expecting, and so while the pleats are interesting, with my hips they ended up hitting in just the wrong place. the waist was also much lower than i expected -- not low rise, but i'm used to thinking high waist with wide legs. in short, these pants are probably great on some body types, just not mine. also very long. i'm 5-8 and a",0
"Online this top looks fabulous, but in person, not so great. great color, nice quality for a lightweight top, but when i tried it on, the neck does not lay nicely. too much sloppy wrinkled material just hanging awkwardly around the neck ( and i love cowl neck). i found, for me, it dipped very low showing cleavage and i have a large chest, so didn't work. for reference, i'm 5'4 118 and usually wear a small in retailer tops because it seems the majority of their clothes run large. i purchased a smal",0
This dress is perfect and so sweet! i do agree with other reviewers in that it runs about 1/2 to one size large. i run anywhere from 6-8 in retailer dresses and i ordered the 6. if you are usually in between sizes definitely order the smaller size. the smaller size also allows me to go braless even though i have a larger (34dd) chest because of the well-constructed bodice. length is nice for us tall girls as well!!,1
"I ordered this top in red. gorgeous color and detail, however just wasn't flattering on my more curvy shape. felt like it looked like a maternity top.",0
"I love this fabric, it is comfortable and forgiving. as i prefer jewel tone colors and the red is beautiful. i thought the sleeve length on this might be odd, but it's fabulous. the only reason i haven't given it five stars is that i haven't laundered it enough to verify the quality",1
"Gorgeous but just too short in length for anyone with a long torso.  i sized up to get more length, but then the neck opening was way too big and hung open to expose - well, everything up top.  wearing a cami would be an option but would take away from the dressiness of the top.  i had to leave without this item, but was disappointed because i love the colors and cut otherwise!",1
"I have literally dozens of deletta tops. just four things to know: very unique/attractive, run large/stretch out (size down), poor quality fabric, and usually low cut.",1
"I was really excited to get this top in the mail; unlike other reviewers, i didn't find that the top fit small, but i thought that the tight fit across the shoulders and chest didn't look good with the billow-y torso of the top. i think this top would be flattering on really thin girls, but i'm very tall and broad shouldered, so it didn't look as good on me.",0
I eyed this for so long hoping it would go on sale. i finally bought it during the 20% off retailer members day. sized up from my usual size 4 to avoid the buttons on the bust looking like they were about to burst free. the rest still fits way. i absolutely cannot wait for the next rainy day to wear this!,1
"I own two poodles and love anything poodle print. i was estatic to see this and i snagged it on sale. but it is horrible. the fit is like wearing a pillowcase. it was about 5 inches too wide on each side while the arms fit. it looked like it was attempting to have a dolman shape but it was way too short, wide, and wrong. i was in love with the print however i had to return it.",0
"This is top makes me feel happy and pretty! with a saturday/sunday black tank or any cami, you will love yourself in it! tts and matches most any skirt! good price too! can wear with skirts or pants.",1
Such a cute take on a henley/button down shirt! i first bought the green and blue version in my typical size medium and while it was bigger than i expected it to be i kept it because i liked the oversized/tunic look i got with some skinny jeans and boots. i decided to order this color in a small to get a different look. i'm just as pleased with the fit of the smaller size! i think this size will work better for tucking in and more tailored looks. yea! these shirts are so soft and made of substan,1
These shorts are divine. the fabric is sturdy and there is a weave of sparkle that i did not perceive from the picture.,1
"This brand has odd fitting of late. i normally wear a m in retailer tops but i had to size up to 12 on this shirt as it was tight across my chest. i am a b cup and had a sports bra on when i tried it. brought it home and tried on with a regular, non pushup bra and it pulls slightly. i might return it because my guess is that it will shrink when washed. otherwise, its a cute tunic style top.",0
I purchased this shirt in the black and it looks great. it fits well and the design with the different color dots adds character. this shirt can be worn with anything and for just about any occasion. thanks retailer for another winner!!,1
"Cute top & well constructed. was surprised at the various gatherings i hadn't noticed before ordering, really like the billowy aspect on the bottom. received lots of compliments.",1
I love this top and bought my usual xs. i don't have any issues with the buttons gaping but am 34b so i'm not a busty girl. i got the adorable umbrella print and living in a rain forest in southeast alaska it could not be cuter.,1
This is more of an undershirt than a shirt. the material is very very thin and it shows everything. it was beyond unflattering on me. don't buy this unless you have a knockout thin body.,0
"I found the fit of this dress to be true to size with a flattering bust and waistline; however, the fabric feels cheap and doesn't drape as nicely as i'd hope for the price. this would be a lovely dress in a better quality fabric. for sizing reference, i'm 5'5'', 122 lbs, 30dd, and took my usual size xs - though i'm busty for my size, the top provides nice coverage.",0
"The shape is awkward, too loose, not flattering. my body just disappears under all the fabric and the bird print wasn't as cute as online. returning this one.",0
I love this shirt! it is so feminine and comfortable! will be on repeat!,1
"I saw this very shirt online & thought it was so pretty. in person, the shirt seems flimsy. the buttons look as though they'd fall off. i also didn't like the cut of the shirt. it seemed to be tighter on top & looser on the bottom. had to return. i couldn't justify the cost with the quality.",0
Love the colors! love the stripes! great shape! great style! but...i am normally a 12 on top...and this pulled across my back...so i have it in for an exchange for a 14. sometimes i have to do that...i have a broad back. we will see how it fits! but what an adorable shirt!,1
I adore this top. the fit is amazing. the colors are vibrant and will transition beautifully into spring. i think it looks great with skinny jeans. i am built small up top size m and the 6 fit perfectly. the buttons did not gape at all.,1
"Sizing: i'm have broad shoulders/back, 36c (34d), short waist, and i usually wear a m in a knit top. that's what i bought, so i'd say that this tee is tts. it is a little longer in the back than front, but not as a high/low top would be. rather, it's sort of tunic-like in style. i have worn it over leggings with and without a sweater, and the added length covers me. i admit that i'm a tad on the short side at 5'2"", and that i have no hips (straight up and down) and no waist. my shape is an upsid",1
"The blazer is boxy and less dressy that it seemed online. i could only really wear this in casual situations, and i was hoping to be able to wear it to work as well. it does have an interesting hemline. the shoulders are a bit too narrow for me (but i do have shoulders on the broader side). i don't hate it, but i don't love it either, but it is interesting enough that i'm going to keep it. i ordered a small.",0
"These are the cutest prints, but the cute simply doesn't work for me. this is longer than the conversationalist shirt, which is an improvement as far as i'm concerned. nevertheless, both my appropriate size, which i still felt was too short, and the size up, which hit at a flattering spot, were twice as wide as as my midsection. so while the arms and shoulders seem true to size, the shirt runs very wide.",0
"I am a 10 m and got the 10. it fits perfectly and there is room in the bust (i'm 36/38 c). the shirt feels very nice and silky up to the skin. i'm just not sure about the print- i got the umbrellas. it's cute, but maybe a little too cartoonish? it does look good with a green or blue puffy vest for colder days...still trying to decide if i should keep or return, but only b/c of the print. i'd love this in some solid colors!",1
"I really love this dress because it can be dressed up with wedges or heels for a wedding or cocktail party, but could also be dressed down with a cute pair of gladiators. i love the pockets too! i'm very happy with my purchase and would recommend to anyone who needs a go-to summer dress for many occasions.",1
"I can't believe these aren't sold out yet.  i had no problem getting this over my head.  this top has such beautiful colors and embroidery.  quality is good.  flattering on.  at this price, it is probably the best deal i've gotten on anything from retailer.  i would recommend this top, absolutely!",1
"This is a very beautiful and well-made skirt. it looks a little like ribbon material. it is very think and lush, and the pockets add a little extra special to it. the waist band is very sturdy and it wears very flattering. even putting my hands in the pockets feels very thick and silky. i am 5'1"" with a 27in waist and the size 2 fit really well, just above the knee.",1
"I tried on the xs in store in crimson (i would need petite) - the color and fit were very flattering on me (pale skin). the dress feels very silky, i love the back, how it ties, and how high the neckline was on me in the front. the little flutter at the bottom of the dress is also a nice touch. my only concern was whether this looked like a negligee... i think i would buy it if i had somewhere to go, just not sure the fabric is appropriate for work... 

reference: 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5 in waist.",1
"This romper was not what i expected when i originally purchased. it is much more casual looking in person, and as soon as i got it out of the bag, one of the buttons fell off. it did look good on and fit well, but i will be returning because it is too casual for the occasion i bought it for.",0
Very soft and luxe materials and really well made. pockets a nice detail and otherwise a great cut and length. petticoat underneath a cool detail too.,1
Fabric was a little more shear than i thought it would be - while not a big deal - it was missing a few of the silver beads along the front line of the top. returned,1
"I too, was dubious about the dry clean only label but purchased it anyway because it was really cute and comfortable.  the shorts part is lined which is nice.  not see through.  the waist is a smocking with elastic.  it's also very thin thread.  the first one i tried on had a couple of stitches ripped in this waistband and because of that the fabric sort of bubbled out.  i bought a different one knowing it was delicate.  this isn't a romper your going to want to shimmy over your hips because of",1
"This skirt is exactly as i had hoped it would be. the zipper works great, the material feels nice, and the liner is attached to the skirt so there is no bunching effect. after the first time i wore the skirt i went out and bought more tops to go with it. i highly recommend this skirt.",1
"The style and material are nice, but what i love is that it does not give me a wedgie! and i think it would still fold nicely on shorter frames.",1
"Super comfy, easy to put on, and super cute! you can dress it up and dress it down! i'm usually a size s and the small fits fine, but i think the xs would have fit better.",1
"I am 5'2"" and got this in a 6p. i would say it fits tts (the top also has some give), but the waist is just a few inches away from being empire. i think the dress on the model is pulled down to de-emphasize this. even so, it is a very cute dress - plan to wear it with a navy velvet jacket for easter.",1
I can't say enough good things about this romper. i am curvey on the bottom and have never been able to get on board with the romper trend because all the ones i had tried were too short or were clearly made for models and teenagers. this romper is a great length and style for all ages and body types. the material is so soft and is the kind of material that won't easily wrinkle. it can easily be dressed up for a night out with wedges and jewelry or dressed down for day with  flats (and maybe eve,1
"Yes,you need these, so comfortable - and wash up perfectly - workout, walking or great to sleep in",0
I was so sure i was going to love this dress when i saw it on the rack. i was so disappointed by how poofy on the bottom. it was not flattering at all! i'd love to see this pattern back with a better fit.,0
"I don't know why this piece is so wide around the body. the fabric is very good. just the design is way boxy. i get xsp, still boxy.",0
"This top was so pretty online! unfortunately it did not work for me- the front was a bit more shapeless in person, though the back was gorgeous, with a button gather at center. the color appeared yellow online, but was a bit more green in person. also, the armholes were very low, so it would need a camisole or no bra.",0
"I bought this dress for my sister's bridal shower, and it was a hit! i was a little bit surprised when it arrived because i did think it was going to be actual tweed - it is not. it is simply a tweed pattern! i think it makes a little bit more casual, but it was a fun dress for an afternoon bridal brunch! one thing i wish it had - pockets!!",1
"I found this to be a very feminine and flattering dress. it is prettier in person. i have the ivory and black print. i agree that it takes a bit of effort to get the slip positioned properly. i might wear a different slip, however i was able to get the slip to stay in place. the print and fabric are a nice quality. i typically wear an xxsp or a 0p. i bought this in the 0 regular because i like my dresses a little bit longer. i think it runs just a little bit small.",1
"Perfect for when you're a guest at someone's home , having guests or just lounging !  prettiest set you'll ever own... you'll feel as if your on vacation even if you're not. i wouldn't travel without this set !! highly recommend. love.",1
Horrible fit not true to size again aline outside of the dress and a very tight camisole underneath,0
"The design and workmanship of this dress are outstanding. the fit may be tricky for some. i am small busted and the bust and even the neckline are very tight and fitted. still flattering, though. i typically wear a 0 or 2 in dresses and purchased this in a 2. i could have worn a 4. 5'8 127lbs. the length is perfect as i purchased this in navy for a wedding. the navy cami slip underneath is top quality with adjustable straps and snaps to hold them in place at your shoulder. overall a sweet and dr",1
"I don't have anything but raves here.  this is a perfectly proportioned jumpsuit of high quality fabric in a neutral color (which is like a denim looking blue color with a beige starburst pattern, much, much nicer in person than in the product photo and has a really neat slightly nubby texture that adds interest).  it's easy to get in and out of.  the back of the waistband is elastic and stretches, so the only thing you have to do is tie the back, which is really easy.  the top (as someone menti",1
Agree with other reviewers that the dress doesn't look like the picture so retailerpligie should really change it out. however i'm keeping the dress since it does look cute on. definitely more yellow in it than you can see.,1
"I usually don't do jumpsuits because i'm 6 ft tall and the torso is usually too short. i saw this one in a store though and decided to try it on. it's very light and soft cotton and fit great lengthwise! overall, the fit is way too large though. i'm usually a size 12 or 14 and i was swimming in the xl - as in the waistband was at least 4 inches too big. the back of the waistband has elastic so if you aren't sure what size to get, size down. i got a size l and it's still a bit too big - the back",1
I usually buy xs or s in retailer clothing and the pieces usually fit perfectly. this time i purchased my first petite item because i was worried the length of the pant leg would fall at an unusual spot if i didn't. i'm 5'4 and i ordered a petite small. i was swimming in it. the elastic in the back was so loose you could see directly down my pants. i wanted to love this but unfortunately the size did not work for me.,0
"I was so excited to receive this dress only to come find out that it was not tweed, not the same colors as the picture, spandex material, the fit runs smaller than most of their dresses and the sleeves are capped. i love retailer and prefer their clothes above all other brands but i was extremely disappointed in this dress.",0
These pajama pants are beautiful but very sheer and very delicate.  not ideal for a mom with kids,0
These leggings are loose fitting and the quality is just not there.. i am returning the item.,0
Thee are beautiful pants. so soft to the touch. true to color. ca.t wait to wear them in the fall.,1
"This dress is beautiful. the fabric is light weight but textured and interesting, and the purple is gorgeous. the soft pink was a bit more orange than i expected, but not a deal breaker. the problem i had with the dress was fit around the arms. i sized up and was glad that i did because it runs small up top, but because the straps come in a bit around the arm holes, it creates armpit fat, which is not a problem i usually have. i could wear the dress with a sweater, but you wouldn't be able to se",0
"I usually wear stevie's in ag, but when i saw the prima was on sale i decided to give it a try and i""m so glad i did! they came today and i tried them on, i will say the rise feels a little higher than mid-rise, but it's so soft and stretchy i didn't really care. they're definitely skinny but with so much stretch they feel like a comfortable legging that doesn't fit quite so tightly. the color/wash is great too. for this price, these are awesome. i ordered a 29, same as my stevies and it fit per",1
"I ordered this dress for a special event and i am so incredibly happy with it! i am 5'1"", 97 lbs, 32b and ordered a 0 petite. fits like a glove. the dress has a slight give to it, but main dress fabric is a thick material so order your usual size. fits close through the waist and flares out below. the length hit above the knee so not too short, although i wouldn't want it any shorter. my main worry was whether my bra would show in the back, but i had no issue. overall, the dress is stunning with",1
"Cute enough, but i couldn't figure out what to do with the tie that didn't make it look like an extra set of sleeves, oddly placed.",0
I've been looking for a nice affordable robe for awhile and this is the one! it's so soft and the design makes you feel fancy when you wear it. perfect for lounging doing my nails or wearing a face mask.,1
"This dress is well made and of good quality it just looked a little too old on me. the skirt was heavy and the fabric was cozy, perfect for a fall outfit.",0
"This dress is a keeper. fits true to size, comfortable and love the pockets. it can be a casual day dress or add some jewelry for a night time dinner out. i was concerned with the fabric being a velvet material but is very light and comfortable",1
"This pullover blouse is a real winner. it is soft and figure flattering, but not too clingy. the neck looks good open or closed with the small button. all in all, it's just a very good design. 
note that the notched thumb holes are completely optional. the holes disappear, without being visible, into the sleeve when they are not being used. also, the sleeve pulls down when the thumb holes are used, so there is no extra length in the sleeves (as may be suggested in the photo).",1
"I tried this in a size medium. i have purchased several rompers this summer and that's usually the size that fits (i'm 5'4"" and hover around 130lbs). i'm short waisted. i don't have a long torso but this just fit. if you look at the model in the pic, she's bent to one side giving the look of blousing at the top, but if you stand upright, it's very straight and smooth. i could get it to blouse over the waist but then i had to pull the bottom up so high the shorts became way to short. i like the m",1
"It's impossible to tell, but this dress is made from very fine wale corduroy. the neckline is very flattering for a smaller chested woman, with a sharp cut (that makes a strapless bra required for peace of mind). the dress does have snaps to hold your bra straps in, but i went ahead with a strapless. the back has a neat square cut. the skirt is slightly longer, on both sides, which gives the dress movement, even though the material is heavier than typically used for this season or cut. i wore it",1
"This dress has pretty colors. the top fit well but the bottom looked like an upside down umbrella. it has enough material to make 2 skirts and the big pockets on the sides make the skirt stick out sideways. the photo of model is from side, not the front. very unflattering on me.",0
I returned the dress because the color was not as pictured in the online photo. i did not like the color.,0
"Unfortunately, this sweater let me down! i love retailer, especially their sweaters, but this one fell flat. it was tight on the arms, and didn't hang well on my body. it was odd in length and added about 20lb to my frame. i kept it because i wanted to force it to work, alas, i just donated it. hopefully it fits someone else better than me..",0
Tried on the xxs petite and still felt that it looked too boxy and baggy on me. cute concept but poor execution,0
"This top was originally way overpriced. so i ordered it on sale for half price. still overpriced. it arrived yesterday and frankly i am disappointed. the quality is not great. it is like a jersey type material. doesn't look like the photograph at all. i like the color, but frankly, that's about it.",0
"I received my coat today. in love! it is so flattering in so many ways. it may not be form fitting, but i love all the details and i'm a sucker for hoods. this is a great fall/winter coat especially if you live in the south. it will probably only work as a late spring/early fall coat for you northern ladies. my only compliant is that the arms are too long, but i'm only 5', so it'll possibly be the perfect fit for someone else.",1
"Ordered this online in the pinkish color. the material is a little thin. as a busty, curvy lady this one just didn't sit right, ran a tad large, and looked boxy. if you have a thinner frame, may be a better look for you. detailing is nice.",0
"I got this in white and was surprised to see that it fits me. i am very petite but with a 32d bust and purchased the xxs. this fit me perfectly! the fabric is soft and kind of silky, the straps were not too long, the hem hit just at my hip line. i am buying the other color!",1
"I just received this coat and love it. the only downside is that online the color looks like a royal blue (which i wanted) but in truth the coat is a basic navy. this was not a deal breaker for me. i love the details. it is not lined as someone mentioned earlier but it's not meant to be a heavy winter coat. i can't wait to wear it with jeans, boots and a striped or plaid tunic.",1
"I ordered this top online during the mother's day sale, thinking i had found the perfect white staple tank i wanted for summer. i had this top on for barely five seconds before i knew it was going straight back. the quality of the fabric and the overall design are both very good. but the problem is that the top comes with an under-layer up top. this is normally a good thing; extra coverage in a sumer top generally means you ca go braless. the problem is that the top layer of the shirt is so shee",0
"Purchased this should in the blue motif in size small. i am usually between a small and medium in shirts, 36c broad shoulders. the fit was fine in the small. however, i had a few issues with the top: 1) the blue motif looked actually like a faded blue (as if it had been washed quite a few times and looked worn), 2) the front mid/bottom section laid strangely and gave me a maternity look, and 3) the back has alot of fabric (see back of tank in white motif) and was very voluminous. for me, it wasn",0
I bought this vest hoping to be able to throw it over long sleeve tops for fall and it's perfect for that- it adds a bit of detail with the buttons and pockets on the vest!,1
"Unbelievably soft fabric that doesn't feel like it will pill. i ordered dark grey. i'm 5'3"" 130 (just after baby) and size m fits well, super-flattering. doesn't smash my buns. the seams are in all the right places to flatter. styling is between ballerina and badass, as i think the ankle wraps look a little tough. i highly recommend.",1
Love this top. looks much better on than the hanger. the color and fabric are very nice.,1
"Great material that drapes nicely. super comfy, feels cool but it's a thick material--not at all see through. so happy i purchased this. and super easy with the snap buttons, but the shirt is very well made and high-quality material. would look great on all sizes and shapes. i'm 5' 4"" and about 140, small chest. normally i'm a s or m with tops but bought this in a m because i like a slightly oversized shirt, though it's also made to be looser and longer. still, at 5' 4"" i'm not swimming in a m.",1
Pretty design and good quality but the medium was very balloony at the bottom. fit my chest alright (34c) but flared out way too much at the bottom.,0
I am petite so ordered in the store and they shipped to my home. i ordered a 24p and they fit great. they stretch a tiny bit. goes with a lot of tops and they are light weight which is great with houston westher,1
"I wanted to love this as i love bright colored patterns. however, when i received the pattern was different than the one pictured and didn't appear as bright and the material was much different than i expected. could almost see through the shirt where it is white and is very thin.

also, i have a larger chest and a smaller waistline and the cut of the where the peplum began made me look larger than i actually am. i am a 36ddd and i normally where a size medium. a medium fit but like i said made",0
I bought this shirt to wear under a black skirt suit. the fabric does have some stretch to it however if you have a normal to above boob size ... beware! i have a 36d chest and the front of the shirt hit me to the point that i then looked preggers. it was one of those situations which reminded me why i do not buy empire dresses. in addition the fabric felt like something my grandmother would have used back in the 60's. it was a thick polyester type material. i think this shirt would still work f,0
"This top did not look at all like it did on the model. i thought it would be slightly loose through the hips but instead it was snug on top and very very very loose. great for someone who is pregnant. which i am not.

"This top is cute! it adds a pop of color to my day and seems to be of high quality. the colors seem more vibrant in person and the material is quite soft and stretchy. as another reviewer pointed out, the peplum is only in the front! it sounds really weird but i don't really mind the look because i'll be wearing a jacket over it. i'm usually a size 12/14 with a 36dd bust and the large fits beautifully.",1
"This is a great looking top but the sizing is way off. in the photo it looks a little oversized. i am normally a medium but this one was very small, sleeves several inches too short and it is more like 25"" long instead of the 35"" listed on the description. in the right size i think it will be great but i'm not sure whether to go up one size or two.",1
"I love the peplum tanks that retailer puts out, but sadly this one did not work for me. the print is vibrant and the colors are even brighter in person, the the material made it look cheap. the fit in the bust was off - i felt that it cut too much into the bra area. and the poof part of the peplum hit me at a weird spot on my torso. really wanted it to work, but maybe it would look better on someone more slender/taller than me (for reference i'm 4'10"" and usually wear size l in retailer)",0
"It's so hard to tell exactly what this sweatshirt looks like from the online photos. it has a white and pale sky blue tie dye look all over with a sea foam green floral print. runs tts. the floral print isn't centered on the one i received, but for $11 i'll be keeping it.",1
"I usually buy a pair of these kind of pants every year from this brand. they are lightweight, sturdy and very flattering to my curvier body. this brand can run big, so i usually buy a size 2 rather than my normal size 4. i was going to wait it out and let someone else try them first, but then i caved and ordered them in two sizes: 26 and 27 because they didn't label them 2, 4, 6 etc. anymore. these pants still look well made and have cute little details, but they are bigger than ever!! the 27's",0
"I was so excited to get this robe in the mail but was beyond disappointed when i opened the package. the fabric is extremely stiff and thin. the fabric felt like something curtains would be made out of and the white background was see through. the robe is very short and cut small in the shoulders, therefore it looked like i was wearing a piece of children's clothing. i also ordered the matching pj pants but didn't even take them out of the package after seeing how rough and see through the mater",0
"I bought this tank for work, but the color of the print is slightly muted compared to the photo. i usually wear a xxs or xs (i am 100 lbs, 5'1) and i got the xs thinking it will be loose, which i wanted. the arm holes were down to my waist, and it was also unusually wide. the quality of the fabric is nice though, not to heavy and not too thin.",1
"This dress did not work well on my figure. i have a small waist and broad hips, and the dress (size m for 140 lbs, 5'8"") was too boxy. i didn't have objections to the fabric, like other reviewers - honestly, even if there were a snag or two, the fabric is kind of rustic and i don't think a snag would look terrible, depending on where it is. i should note that one of the ornamental buttons immediately fell off the dress upon arrival. my friend got the same dress in a size s and it worked better f",0
Wore this dress for easter dinner and received many compliments. it is delicate and if not careful the diamond pattern can snag. i loved the comfort and ability to dress up or down. i ordered the regular instead of petite as i wanted the length at my knees not thigh high. and it fit perfect at 5'4.,1
"This dress is beautiful and unusual. i think the colors shown in the picture are a little brighter than the dress i bought...the turquoise and gold seem slightly more muted in person, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. there are sequins along the shoulders of the dress that you also can't see in the picture, but they aren't gaudy or too stevie nicks-bohemian. i didn't find the bodice of the size m too tight as another reviewer noted...it's' my normal size, and though i'm a little chesty (32-34",1
"I ordered this dress in two sizes, pxs and ps. they both arrived in a timely manner but the pxs was snagged upon arrival. there were a few other reviewers that stated the dress snagged easily but i loved the classic look of this dress so i thought i would take the chance. unfortunately i had to take both back to the store because the potential for snagging the fabric was too high even considering the sale price. also, the dress comes with a cotton slip but the slip for the pxs was tiny while the",0
"This dress hangs like a sack. it really needs a belt to give it some shape. i tried to style it with one, but then didn't look right either. i did like the slip that came with it. i'll be returning it.",0
"I thought this was more like an oversized sweatshirt. not at all! i'm either a m or l and i bought a large and that was too small and too tight. it is more fitted. if you are looking for something more comfy, don't buy. however, if you want more of a fitted blouse feel, then go for it.",0
"This dress is so cute and so flattering. i loved the shape, but i wore it wonce and the fabric was pulling on everything! just holding a purse while walking managed to pull out a ton of the fabric! when you spend so much money on something you think the quality would be better..",0
I really loved the colors and style of this top. unfortunately it runs a bit small and was too short on me. i'm 5'9. some mentioned they didn't like fabric but i thought it was good!,0
"I wanted to like this so much. it's a great good girl dress, church dress. however, it makes no sense. it's a summer dress with massively thick lining that snags i'm petite and busty and it made me look and feel very wide.",0
"I was excited to try this on in the store today. the zipper details on the shoulder are really cute and the ribbing pattern is flattering. i was disappointed when i put it on though because it fits like a baby-doll / pregnancy top. it's snug around the bust, and then flares out pretty widely through the lower half. you can't really see that on the model. i was hoping it was more of a fitted tee, but sadly, that wasn't the case.",0
"I did the happy dance when the dress arrived, but the very sad dance when i tried it on. unfortunately, instead of following my instincts, i took the review here (and reviews from some other sites) to heart and ordered a size bigger than usual . huge mistake, as in this dress was huge -- much too big to alter and keep the integrity of design. for reference i'm 5'7, 130lbs, 34c. i usually wear an 8 dress (due to a very large rib cage). i ordered the 10 but was literally swimming. i think a 6 woul",1
"Beautiful sweater, perfect length, surprisingly warm",1
"I would have loved this tee but the color didn't love me. it's sort of a mustard orange. the embroidery is beautifully done but i felt the size of the yarn tassels were too big and looked a bit odd, but i have a large bust so don't like to draw attention there. it's a sweatshirt and not a tee shirt, but it flows and doesn't grab anywhere. it looked so nice under a jean jacket. if it weren't for the color and tassels, it would be a keeper for me.",1
"Believe the reviews - this dress is very flattering, great quality, and an excellent print (i got the polka dot). i was concerned about the wrap front since i am busty - 32dd - but this looks great, is appropriate for work. love!",1
"This vest looks exactly as in pictures which is a good thing for online exclusives. i love the fact that it's lined and the texture and color of the fabric is very nice. has a good, solid quality feel to it. it does not have any buttons or belt that comes with it but looks perfectly fine just left opened. i wore it with belt as well and it add to the structured styling of the vest. more on the conservative side of retailer.",1
"I have been searching for the perfect white shirt. this is it! i love how the collar lays and the longer length and frayed hem are perfection! the fabric is super soft, too. i am very pleased with this purchase!",1
"This is a cute top although it runs fairly large. i have washed it once and the fray did ok; however, i'm a bit concerned about how the shirt will wash over time with the frayed edges.",1
"Great for the beachy business look. classy, but immensely comfortable. i feel like i look sharp without having to sit poker-straight.",1
"It is such a cute dress. the mulit-colored aspect allows me to wear many different color shoes with it. the dress can be formal or informal, and it works for a myriad of occasions. please purchase it!!!!",1
"I was excited to see this dress as i'd bought the sparrow boiled wool sheath dress in xs last year and loved the fit. however, this dress does not fit the same way. the top fits fine, but the waist and the bottom are way too big. i laid it over my sparrow dress from last year, and the bottom is at least an inch wider (two inches, if you go by the total circumference). i'm planning to exchange for an xxs and see if that one fits better.",1
"I purchased this in grey and wine and both are wonderful. the boiled wool is light but warm and not itchy. fits nicely through the bodice and flares out to create a nice shape. the pockets are terrific and lay nice and flat. i'm short but the petite was well above my knee. i could have worn petite small just fine. it fit nicely in the bodice - the smaller size brought the seaming up a bit higher to form a more empire waist, but i chose the petite medium because i wanted it loose through the wais",1
"Unfortunately this dress ran very large on me (please no more vanity sizing!) and minimized what few curves i have. my store didn't have this in petite so i tried a regular xs - the neckline was low and there were at least 4 inches of space at the waist. it also flares out quite a bit, you can see this in the catalog shot. while this wasn't flattering on me, it may work better on curvier figures.",0
I did not like this cashmere sweater at all. i ordered the pink which was more of a peach color. although the color was very pretty the material was very thin and cheap looking . it was also very short . not worth the money even at 40% off.,0
"Love the warm fuzzies of this sweater, did not love the unflattering cut. the sweater hung lifelessly from my bust line down. plus, it was a little short in the front. i have to send it back. :(",0
"I had ordered another retailer suit awhile back in an xl because my usual lg was not available, and lets say i was swimming in the xl, much to big. so when this suit came up for sale i snatched it up in lg. when i compare the two, the lg is over 4inches smaller than the xl, seems like quite a big jump in the sizing. the suit fits in the body quite well, however it's a bit snug in the side bust area. strangely, the suit has boning on the side of the bust, and also the silicone grip on the top edge,",0
"The dress is great for pear shapes. however, i do feel it runs larger than typical retailer sizing. ordered a small (5'8"" 140#) and i still think it may be a bit big. the material is very comfortable, not too thick or thin. however, i feel the shaping on the bottom is a little bulky due to the fabric. see the attached photo.",0
"Overall, this swimsuit is what i needed and have been looking for. i normally wear bikinis but i needed a one piece, and i wanted something unique and different. i ordered the chevron print, and i do love the colors and ""retro"" look of the swimsuit. if i could change a couple of things, i would have the legs and booty slightly more high cut -- but not much. and i might have wanted the option to take off some, if not all, of the straps. other than that, i do love it...and i doubt that anyone else",1
I really liked the design. ordered a medium which was huge. also thought i would not be able to tolerate it because of the material -- a bit itchy. returned it.,0
"Such a unique mix of prints but it totally works. much better and more vibrant in person. true to size. fits more like a maxi on me since i'm 5'1""",1
"I agree with some of the other reviewers; this dress runs very large. when i tried on the xs in my local store, i loved the color and thought i could work with it with the right bra or camisole, but it was just cut far too low in the front and when i tried it on at home, it was just too roomy and not fitted enough. i ordered both an xsp and an xxs today so we will see if they fit better. it is an adoreable design, cut and color. it just runs way big so size down if you decide to get it.",1
"Les fauves is another version of last years larkhill swing dress but better.  one, the swing has less to swing, but in a good way!  they reduced the voluminous amount of material while retaining the fun swing aspect. two, the dress is shorter so it's more flattering to the vertically challenged like me. what's the same?  still wonderful silk, discreet pockets, beautiful abstract floral print and those horrid little buttons that are difficult to fasten on the back of a tight neckband collar.  i h",1
"I wanted to love this dress! i ordered it when there was a 20 percent off special and couldn't wait to get it. the colors are as depicted and the dress fit true to size. i also liked that it wasn't too short. what i didnt like was that the dress is lined in white, which you can plainly see in the picture, but i didnt notice before ordering. i just think it would have been much prettier lined in black. im disappointed and the dress is going back.",0
"Found this dress at my local retailer. . it was one of those dresses that just catches your eye.. very,very, beautiful print. . the dress is loose and flowy and feels so comfortable on. i purchased it without a second thought. i am 5'1"" and usually wear a 0 or 2 and the 2 was a better fit for me. so breezy and cool for summer.",1
"This dress does run large, but i'm wearing it loose and flowy. bought it for desert trip music festival, with booties and a hat or headband, very hippie chic. my husband thinks it's adorable! the prints are darling.",1
"First one i received was ripping apart already in the sleeve opening at wrist (warning: very tight sleeves!), plus 2"" of the green shiny band detail was missed altogether by whomever sewed this particular one- just left unstitched. and long threads were hanging in several places. this is by no means a quality piece and is severely overpriced. on the positive side, it is very cute and i'm keeping the replacement one, but know that it is also delicate. after one use, there is a snag on the inside",0
Great piece. using as a night gown. slept in it last night. like a dream.,1
"I like the make of this dress, the fabric is thick and light at the same time.
the cut is loose and flattering. the different patterns are also very fun. colors are gorgeous, nice details. the buttons are sturdy. 
i tried on both 0p and 00p - not much difference in the 2 (i would go petite if you are on the short side). the 00p was just a bit snugger near the =chest, but didn't gape. the waist is definitely meant to be looser, so don't expect a fitted dress. length was slightly above the knee",1
"Very quick delivery. ordered sunday and in my mailbox tuesday before noon! nice fit, length is perfect. i'm 5'3"" and the regular size 6 hits just above the knee. one thing is the nice little button in the back fell off just as i was going to try it on. found on the floor and i will just sew it back on. other than that i love the print and everything about the dress. true to size. ?? retailer",1
"I wanted to love this dress. i went into retailer in sb to try it on and when i saw it on the rack it looked beautiful, both the print and the material. then i tried it on and it fit like a tent. i am just under 5'5 and it hit right below my knees, not like shown in the picture here. on that note, i passed on this one due to the fit. i think this would make a fantastic maternity dress though.",0
"The fit on this shirt is bizarre--it very much resembles a nursing top (but wouldn't actually work for that purpose). the side visible in the picture is nicely draped, but the other side can flap open and is completely different. i tried two different sizes and both were equally unfortunate!",0
"I generally wear a 27. jeans fit perfectly. skinny, but not too skinny.",1
"I was so excited to receive this romper. it's a great material, but it's actually a bit drab. the colors are very bland and the flowers just hang. it's not flattering as it is very roomy.",0
"I own some pure and good cotton tanks similar to this in black that i live in teaching dance. i was hoping these would be the same. i ordered the pale blue and it is completely see through and fits tight in the back and loose in the front. i have no desire to have a bra/sports bra show whether out the sides or through the fabric, it is tacky!",0
What a great purchase (especially on sale!) as this tank can't get more comfy. the material is soft and great to wear during those warm weather months. love it!,1
"This is a beautiful dress. it fits true to size. i have some issues around the middle and this just flows away from the body. i am 5'5"" and it falls to the knee on me, longer than pictured on the model. the fabric is a nice weight that can be worn three seasons. the print is pretty and romantic. i'm planning to wear this to my daughter's very informal wedding and know i'll be comfortable and look put together. this was a lucky find!",1
"I saw this top online and fell in love with it, as i live in white cotton comfy tanks, but i was concerned that it might make me look like i was wearing a tent from the side profile since i am top heavy - 36d, and i happen to have this problem with some tops and dresses. so i went into the store to try it on in a size l and i was shocked how not only did it not look like a tent it had a slimming effect! i felt so attractive in it i had a hard time looking at myself in the mirror (believe me this",1
"I loved this dress when i saw it online! i could not wait until i see in one of the local stores.  i bought it today! unlike other reviews, i think this dress runs large. i am a 4 and bought the zero. maeve tends to run large on me. i would suggest that you try a size smaller. it looks very flattering!",1
"I'm 5'8"" and 130 and this made me look huge. it was a small but too billowy. it is pretty, nice fabric and well made but i returned.",0
"I saw this on sale, and it looked lovely online. i really wanted to love it when i received it. it looked great, but once i tried it on, it bunches up in the back. it looks awkward. the lace and small details are pretty, but the fit is just off. returned it in the store.",0
These pants are comfortable and cozy. great for lounging around and cute enough to wear out of the house to coffee or running errands. i'll be wearing them a lot.,1
This would have been cute if it was more fitted. i am 5'7 and 125 lbs and the small was too wide. i didn't try the xs because the small was almost too short in the sleeves and so was the length.,0
"I have been eyeing these pants for about a month or so; every time i stopped by my local retailer store i would check them out but never actually bought them. well, today i finally went for it and i am so glad i did! the floral pattern is very feminine yet unique and the colors are uplifting and cheerful for spring. the material is very soft, light and flowy and i'm sure will be comfortable in the heat of summer. the only drawback i found was that the fabric is not very stretchy and i like to be a",1
"It's like a work of art, but sadly, not flattering on me. i absolutely loved the look, and even considered taking it to a tailor, but the material overall is very stiff. if you're teeny tiny and need something to give you the illusion of hips, you might love it. very sad to return this.",0
"These are very pretty, but i have had a few problems with them. out of the package, i found them to be true to size. i think i purchased the pxxs or the pxs. however, even though they are machine washable, i feel that they shrunk upon washing and are now too short (i am barely over 5' tall). also, the elastic waistband keeps twisting within the casing, which drives me crazy. i have to keep straightening it. i think there are better options for sleep pants.",0
"I was so excited about this top, and so disappointed when it arrived today. the lace part is lovely, but the skirt part is a crinoline type fabric that balloons out at the sides. it is gathered at the sides rather than pleated, and there is no way to get it to lay flat. the back center section is pleated. why couldn't they have had the pleats all around? this will be going back with much regret.",0
"I want to like this sweater. the color is lovely, more of a grayish blue, and the design is nice. the quality is amazingly good, as it's thick without being too thick and very soft. but the design is odd and quite unflattering! i got the xsmall but it's two big. the sleeves have a very low shoulder so they almost have a wing like look. it doesn't look like it does on this model. the waist area is a lot bigger, so it does sit on your hips, however the sweater isn't slimming cause of the odd shape",0
I waited a long time to get this top. unfortunately i will be returning. the sides are gathered and stick out a lot on the sides. not as pictured. the sides should have been pleated. it runs smaller in the bust and when closed it was a little snug. afraid this might shrink with dry cleaning or washing. the design is unique and wish this top would of worked.,0

"I ordered this dress looking for something to wear out for an evening. after seeing the other reviews i wasn't sure about it, but i was very pleased when it arrived. i find it is elegant and sexy, but also modest enough when i sized up by 1. i normally wear an xs in dresses but found the small fit perfectly. it is form-fitting particularly in the waist and back without being too tight. i'm excited to wear it and think it would look beautiful with a long necklace.",1
I can't stand buying pants and i can see the pockets lining and my darker skin through the fabric. i don't consider that high-quality.,0

"I love the neckline on this - sharp enough for work, but cute for a fun night out too. only complaint is it's soooo flowy on the bottom. i could hide a baby under here for sure. i got the medium thank goodness or it would have been ridiculous. i'm 5'8, 160lbs. great for fall.",1

I can usually be counted on to love a pretty top with lace detail and a bit of flow. this one has those qualities but it does not look great on me. perhaps it is too flowy because i am 5?3. or possibly the fabric is too soft a look on me. i did size down as reviewers suggested. maybe one size was not enough :-). i must return it.,0

"I'm happy with this sweater! a few things that may help others: 1) the detail on the yoke is made from a silky taupe-colored fiber, 2) it is ivory, not white and 3) although the fit is true to size, the sweater runs short, so if you prefer a longer fit you may want to size up.",1
I'm not sure i recommend this shirt but i did purchase the plum yesterday. i'm always always a m and had to size down to an xs on this one. that's how large it was! even the xs had plenty of room; i'm 5'6 145 lbs 36b for reference. the material look like it will stretch out even further but i got it anyway. it was on sale plus 25% off and for that price i can use it for casual days on the weekends. it's comfortable on and loved the lace detail.,0

"Usually the whole boho style looks funny on me, but the cut and print were subtle enough for me to pull it off. the colors are beautiful - probably flattering against any hair or skin tones...i took my usual small because the shoulders were generous enough. word of caution - this is dry clean only.",1
"I was really excited after finding this top online and reading the reviews; the combination of peplum, cap sleeves, and color seemed too good to be true. i ordered a size medium but unfortunately, this top is on the short side so wearing it with pants or jeans did not work out. in addition, the fabric was more sheer than it looks in the picture and the v-neck in front dipped a little lower, too. a camisole might have solved both of those problems but i didn't bother. i returned it to the store.",0
"This is a really pretty shirt - the colors are beautiful.  it runs large, and it's semi-sheer.  shape is loose and boxy, but because it's more sheer, it didn't seem as boxy.  i'm tall, and this was long enough.  only change would be to make the sleeves a little less bell like.  not tight, but lose some of the volume.",1
"This shirt is beautiful. it is flowy and light, a perfect piece for transitioning from winter to spring. however, do not follow the washing instructions on the tag. it says you can machine wash, tumble dry low, and despite going one step further and washing on my gentle cycle in cold water and drying it on extra low, it came out of the wash so small that a child could barely wear it. it went from being a tunic to an inappropriate crop top i will never wear again. if you do order, please take the",0
The blue is not see though at all and the length is perfect. so many tops now are on the longer side or have the high/low hems. this one is great....love it. kinda want the white one now!,1
"This is a beautiful and well-made top; sadly it just didn't work for me. i'm 5'1 with a pretty short waist and even on me it was too short. the shortness might've worked if it wasn't as baggy as it was. i don't mind baggy, loose-fitting tops, but this was so much so that it was just unflattering; it looked a bit boxy as well.",0
"Nicely made, pretty details, but it's cropped fairly short and is rather boxy. wore with orange linen pants and it was cute!",1
"I am 5'3"", 118 lbs and fit perfect in size s petite. good material and flatting!",1
"Love this top! such a pretty color and so comfy. sleeves are a bit long, but fits pretty true, like most left of center. washes and dries in the dryer very nicely.",1
I ordered the orange version in size xl. it fits true to size. the fit on me matches the online photos. it's so comfortable to wear. i love the unique details of it. i've washed & air-dried it too. it retained its size. the color is outstanding. it's such a pretty shade that looks more red online than it does in person. there's more of a darker orange tint to it. i've gotten a lot of use out of this tee. hopefully it'll come back in the fall in more colors.,1
This top is a cross between a shirt and sweater. great length and very soft. it does run a little large so size down if you are n the fence. hangs nicely in the back.,1
This top is great to wear to work or for enjoying brunch or dinner with friends. it is very comfortable and pairs great with jeans for a dressed down look. i sometimes wear it under a chambray dress and have gotten a ton of compliments. great purchase!,1
Ordered this online and thought it was more of a red than the true orange that it is,0
"I love this shirt. i have it in black and purple. i found the fit tts and looks great casually with a scarf or dressed up with a nice necklace. you can't go wrong with a cute long sleeve shirt that is soft. i like the length goes just past my bottom in the back but not overwhelming.
it is more fitted than last years style.",1
I bought this shirt in black and green and now bought the orange. it is casual and stylish at the same time. material is soft. great shirt!,1
"This is so comfortable, i had to buy another one. looks great under sleeveless sweaters. interesting texture adds interest.",1
"Beautiful in white, and beautiful to look at, but as the other reviewer mentioned, the fabric is very sheer and see thru. not a deal breaker if worn over a cami; however, the reason i am returning it is the fit. there is too much fabric flaring right at my waist. it looks like a tent on me. in addition, some of the beading is already coming off, and i can't imagine what it will look like after one wash. that's too bad, but i can't justify paying this much money for a sweet top that is beautiful",0
"This blouse is made out of a high-quality material, flows beautifully, and the neutral flower pattern makes its yellow/green base pop. i played with a bow and decided that it looks the best tied lower than on the model to form v shaped neckline. this piece will transition easily from one season to the next and from causal to dressy. for the reference, size 12 was the best fit form my curvy 36dd frame.",1
"I love this top (so cute and comfy!), but i wore it twice, washed it once on gentle and layed to dry.....now there are 2 small holes in the front. for as much as it cost, i would have expected it to be more durable. very disappointing, especially since i don't live near an retailer and can't take it back easily......",0
Love this sweater it's perfect for chilly florida evenings....love the loose boxy shape and it's very cozy not itchy!,1
A great everyday tee!! dress it up a bit with a great gold necklace!! looks nice with jeans and brown boots!!,1
This sweater is very cute! it looks great with a blouse underneath and open the zipper or it is great with a camisole. you will need something underneath especially if the temperatures are low as it is a wee bit shear. i am a small/medium ordinarily but it depends upon the designer. this runs a little large but keep that in mind if you plan on layering. the price is right and the zipper is aesthetically pleasing. i have the blue and oatmeal/beige color both are great pieces to any wardrobe.,1
"I am 5' 4 1/2"", 125 lbs., and ordered a m in this. i'm usually between a s and m. it was too big and didn't have any shape to it. i don't think a s would fit much better. also, i ordered the pink but it was really a coral. if my local store had a s i would probably try it on in a different color, but they don't. i'll have to return this. it looks so cute online.",0
"I have been looking at this sweater online since it first came out and i finally ordered it when it was 40% off. i ordered a size m petite, sadly when it arrived and i tried it on, it was very boxy, stiff like, and did not flow like it looked on the model online so i sent it back.",0
"Absolutely stunning. the color, the pattern, the quality. i love everything about this top.",1
"I was really excited to get this top but unfortunately its going to have to go back. i am 5'6 120 and usually a s fits. however, this was really tight. also, the material is really really thin for the $90 price-tag. save yourself some money and avoid this one.",0
Runs very large. ordered a smaller size due to other reviews but should have ordered several sizes smaller,0
"I bought this sweater for my future daughter-in-law for her birthday in coral. she lover it! the contrast of color in the yarn is hard to see in the photos. grey and bright coral, just beautiful!",1
"This was exactly the item i was looking for. simple, black, stylish.  unfortunately the fit is terrible and proportions completely off.  the upper arms, chest and hips were ridiculously tight and the whole look was uncomfortable and flattering.",0
"I second that above review who states ""worst blouse i've ever ordered""",0
"This sweater is so much better in person. it is a heavy, soft knit that fits perfectly.i am petite and thin and took the reg xs. it is very flattering and drops just below the hips. the bottom is a bit flowy. i bought the beige and bright pink color. the pink is very dark and bright and has an orangy tint to it. i wear a dark beige cami underneath. super cute with cuffed dark jeans and black booties.",1
"Great jeans. especially since i'm getting tired of my skinny jeans. length is great for someone tall like me (5'10"") unless you wear heels with them but these are more sneaker/sandal jeans.",1
The pictures of this sweater do not do it justice. i would have passed it over online but it immediately caught my eye in the store. the yarn is soft and cozy and the flair at the bottom adds a feminine touch. zipper is cute. v-neck is just right - it is not too low. i know i will be wearing this sweater a lot - very happy with this purchase! i didn't see the pink or navy in the store.,1
"This is a fun, cozy sweater. i feel you can dress it up and use it casual too. i bought the ivory in size s, i'm 5'2''. although i put it runs true to size, it's is a tad tight around my upper arms, not uncomfortable. i have normal to somewhat skinny arms, so i don't think it was my body type. i didn't check other sweaters in the same size to see if it was an isolated case. it is to be worn loose, it has quite a bit of material all around mid to lower part, just fyi.",1
"My normal size 30 in the hyphen chinos fits my size 10 body very well. these selvage jeans were too tight in the hips, too loose in the waist, and too tight in the knees, and i don't have big knees. also, the cuff was down to the floor instead of ankle length. cuffed, they seem to have a 32 inch inseam, and these were regular, not tall. basically, i think you need to have a straight up and down shape with no curves, and very long legs for this jean to work.",0
"I usually wear small, ordered xs and it's still way too large. quality not that great, just meh, returning it.",0
"I think these jeans are good for people with long lean legs. i'm 5'7"" 155 lbs and the wide cuff made my legs look short and stubby. the weight of the jeans is a little on the heavier side - i usually like soft denim. i usually wear a 31 and thought they were true to size.",0
"I ordered this sweater in the pink color in a small and xsmall, in order to see which was the best fit. i was really looking forward to getting it because it looked so great online - like it had a nice flow, the cute zipper and was a good match for a pink and grey skirt that i have. i was really disappointed, the sweater doesn't flow like it does in the picture - it kind of billows out in the front and back and isn't flattering. i have a small build, and, frankly, i usually look good in sweaters",0
These jeans are perfect in every way. i found that i took one size smaller than i do in the pilcro chinos. they are comfortable and have a small amount of stretch to them. i knew i was buying them the instant i put them on. they look great - highly recommend.,1
After reading other reviews i ordered a small. my usual size is a m. it was huge all around. it's a beautiful print but i think it would make a nice maternity top.,0
"As soon as i saw this dress online, i knew i wanted it!  i was immediately drawn to the belled sleeves and lace embellishment along the neck/shoulders.  i ordered online, and was so happy with the fit and quality of the dress.  i am 5'5 and it hits just an inch above my knee.  it's the perfect little black dress for a fun date night or an event!",1
"I wish i had read the other review about the color of the pink version of this sweater before i ordered it. she was absolutely right - the color is completely different in person. it is this garish pink and brown that looks like it was knit together with remaindered yarn. it's too bad, because the cut of the sweater is cute and the zipper adds a funky touch. maybe the blue is better in person...",0
The linen fabric is elegantly thin feels and looks lovely,1
"There were no reviews, it's an ""online exclusive"" and thought it might look good with a nice skirt at an upcoming wedding. the spandex jersey back looks like sweat shirt material. on the white version of this, it is mismatched with an oatmeal color and white that just looks awful. as a busty 36d i was stunned to find myself swimming in a medium. it does not look like the photograph and the sleeve billow out. i feel like this had to have been clipped and tucked in for this photograph. i'm an anth",0
"I am petite (5'). even the xsmall petite looked sloppy on me. i also disliked the nude fabric under the lace- it made it look cheap. i wanted this to be the perfect lbd, i  just couldn't make it work on my body.",0
"I purchased all three colors! this sweater is gorgeous. i love it. it's made well, all three colors are beautiful and it fits great. it's definitely true to size. i'm thrilled with this sweater. adorable!",1
"This sweater was a little bit of a let down. i ordered the pink and it is actually a tan sweater with (bright) coral material woven throughout. it wasn't the 'soft pink/coral' color that it appeared to be online. while the material is very cozy, the sweater itself is short and boxy. i would've like the width better if the length would've been a little more proportionate. i am 5' 0"" and ordered a petite small. probably returning.",0
"I purchased these on sale and am only keeping them because they were such a low price. i ordered the 2 petite, but they do not actually seem to be made for a petite person. they are still very long (to my ankles) and the legs are very wide. the waist fits fine though.",0
"I ended up returning it just because it didn't do much for my current postnatal figure, but otherwise this top is just so pretty and unique!",1
This is so cute with a shirt or tee under neath. the look is better with a shirt underneath. very adorable for many occassions. i ordered the petite sizing b/c i like my pants more cropped.,1
I love a cropped pant but these do not hit the mark. the pant would have been more flattering if they hit just above the ankle instead of the calf. i think they make the leg look stunted. the material was a nice weight and good quality but the bow being attached was a big design flaw. it look cute tied but would have been much nicer if you could remove it when needed.,0
"This shirt style is boxy, however, the material is soft and this shirt is very comfortable. i love the look of the cuffs. this is a fun shirt to wear",1
"These are such quirky pants! they're a lot of fun, well made and i love the wide, cropped legs. they do run small - though most reviewers say they are true to size. i wear a 4/6 or 28, and in these i had to get a size 10. very tight at the waist, even though the rest of the pant flows easily and is loose. great color, they'll be perfect for spring and fall, and you can probably pair with boots in the winter. just a fun staple to my wardrobe.",1
"I loved the color and lines of this jumpsuit, but found it to be far too short in the torso. (and about 8"" too long in the leg, but that's a lot easier to fix.) i tried sizing up, but it still wasn't working for me. i'm only 5'7"", and while i'm long-waisted i can usually make jumpsuits work. if you have a short torso and long legs, this is a beautiful option. otherwise, i can't recommend it.",0
"This is such a pretty dress. i was worried the arm holes would be too big since it was hard to see them in the pictures, but they are perfect! there is a built in red slip underneath. it is so cute on and really flattering by itself or even with some white skinny crop jeans underneath!",1
"I tried wearing it, however, i thought i needed courage to wear this tank.
unfortunately, i did not purchase this tank although i liked color and design.
first, it runs small than the regular size. 
it feels even smaller because my size is xs.
in addition, it tends to exaggerate a body line.
i am not quite sure why this happens, but maybe it is just the way this tank is.
if you are confident about your upper body posture, then yes, it would look very cool.
however, if you have thin postur",0
"Very nice soft fabric, has a nice swingy drape and flair. i use it to work out in , sleep in and just hang out around the house. could be paired with white pink or black leggings and a scarf too. very happy with this purchase.",1
"40% sweaters...i couldn't pass it up. unfortunately, when i raise my arms, my tummy shows (i'm 5'6""), so i had to return it.",0
"I love the look of this garment. from the color to the detailed design, it is just awesome looking. i tried this in 3 sizes: 2regular, 2petite, and 0 regular. i often order petite pants and they work, but for this item the crotch was too high for me to wear a petite size, and the legs were short enough to look awkward. i returned it for the 0 regular which fit me best - i'm 5'5, 110 lbs. i haven't worn it out yet, but am excited to wear it to a couple weddings this season. one fallback is that i",1
"When i saw this item online, i ordered it right away. loved the color and the oversized, comfy look to it. the pros: very soft,the color a deep cranberry as pictured. the cons; the low back - in the photo, the model's arms cover it up. when i put it on, it looked like an oversized flap that stuck out on the sides and was very visible from the front -- and because the material is unstructured, that made it look worse. i loved it except for this one feature, but because it was so detracting, i had",0
"I love this dress so very much! i wish i could keep it, but it doesn't look right on me. i am 5'2, 100lbs, 32b, 24 waist, 33 hip. dress fit me well except for the fact that it made me look very wide. i think the combination of the ruffles on the sleeves with the blousey-ness and my short stature was not a great combo. it will be amazing on tall slender women, but did not flatter my short frame :( 
otherwise beautiful",1
"I've worn this twice now. the first time was after trying it on and realizing it was perfect. immediately purchased and never took it off. the second time, wore it to my internship (office) followed by museum and a concert. incredibly versatile. constant compliments. 5'7"", 135 pounds, 34 c, 27/28 waist. meant to be loose, carefree, incredibly modern. does wrinkle after long periods of sitting, but not enough to dislike. the biggest complaint for me and my retailer coworkers is that it is an incred",1
"After a few months of coveting, i received this jumpsuit as a gift (apparently my longing wasn't too subtle!) and was delighted to find it didn't disappoint at all! the material has a nice weight and falls away from the body, but still is very swingy and light. it is great for our slightly chilly spring, yet i expect it will be fantastic as the weather warms up. i am 5'6"" and usually a 26"" or size 2 in bottoms and an xs or s on top. i got this jumpsuit in an xs and it fits very loosely (much lik",1
It is soooo cute!!! i'm trying to figure a few things before deciding to keep..... how one goes to the bathroom when wearing it? i can't figure out how to get it on without help tying the straps in the back?,1
"I am allergic to wool and have a hard time finding winter sweaters. was really excited when i read material content on this item only to be disappointed upon arrival to note that sweater is 10% wool. also found it to be very tight in arm area. for reference i am 5'10"", 130 lbs. and would say have slender arms! cute design that will work for some!",0
I bought this in the plum & love the color. i got this in xs which is my usual size & it's a little bit baggy but i think this is the style of the sweater. the front on me is not as long as pictured but just covers the top of my pants. my daughter liked it so much she bought the exact same one.,1
Super cute pants but pleats fan out too much when you are pear shaped. i would also need to shorten pants too look like the picture.,0
"Ah! i wanted to love this but without anything under it (as pictured), the petite sizing reveals way too much side boob. i am 5'3"" and a small b cup. i ordered an xs petite. it fits but there isn't enough material under the armpits. the fabric and design is great other than this flaw. sadly returning.",0
"I tried this on in a store and it was beautiful except the sizing was way off. i'm 5'11"" and usually a 12 or 14. the 12 was skin-tight and the 14 was so loose it was comical - and even on my super long legs, the cuffs dragged on the floor. plus the lacy panels in the cleavage area are totally see-through and my bra was very visible. i was totally bummed. also incidentally, this didn't seem the best quality. there were strings hanging out of the lacy areas, and the waist tie ties way higher than",0
The fabric is soft and the colors are bright. it fits well over the shoulders and the neckline is placed just right on the chest. the bottom portion of the tank is more of a swing style item than a form fitting tank. i am very pleased with the top and will wear it often.,1
"I've been wanting to try the cropped pleated pants style and i like these. the material is nice & comfortable and the bow adds whimsy. compared to other brands i've tried, these pants fit the best. the waistband goes up higher in the back so there's no gapping (a big plus for me). just one thing, i find cartonnier to run small so i would suggest ordering one size bigger.",1
"This sweater is absolutely adorable! i was worried about the layers looking too frumpy but they were not - i normally wear a size medlum (8), but i sized down on this sweater on a gut feeling and bought a small --i didn't want it to be too loose or billowy, and it fits perfectly. will be so cute with jeans but also with skirts for work! you will be so happy you bought this one.",1
"I ordered these jeans on sale based on the great reviews, but when the arrived the color looked different from the online pictures. i don't love the color but decided to try them on anyway since i've never tried ag before. well they are so soft and comfortable and fit great! i didn't want to take them off, so i ended up keeping them. now ag is my favorite brand for jeans!",1
"I was hesitant to buy this because it is double breasted which isn't my first choice. that was the least of the problems with this jacket. i love sparkle, and i love beautiful detail, none of the elements by themselves was a problem. the sum of the parts didn't work, though. the end result was an unflattering, confusing mess. the silhouette plus the frayed edges, plus the sequins plus the vent in back plus the huge buttons plus the double breast, plus the zipper were just too many things to go t",0
"This dress is really cute, it's not a complete bag on you. i read that other reviewers complained about the fact that it is see-through. and that is the case, but i own multiple pairs of skin-toned underwear and did not find this to be a problem. the fabric is lightweight, but perfect for the summer. it does wrinkle, but a steamer is your best friend.",1
"I really wanted to love this dress, but i couldn't. it ran large and heavy. rather than a sleek cocktail dress, it felt more like a heavy sack once i put it on. there was one upside: the drape in the back did not appear to drop quite as low, so finding a bra to wear under the dress might be easier than if it draped as low as it appears in the picture.",0
I love this jacket. it's the prettiest and most stylish jean jacket i've ever owned. the sleeves run small. i'm an xs but chose a small so i can button it and wear thin sweaters underneath.,1
"More importatn, super soft matieral and comfortbale, hwoever, when i put it on, ilfelt like i was wearing a robe... i do like the detial in the fabric, but jsut dind't feel right as cardigan. maybe purchase if you are looking for a light robe.

true to size, tried on xs, maybe petite would work too.",1

"This sweater is a pretty color and style and is really soft and comfortable - i really wanted it to work. a small fit my 5'7"", 140 lb frame well (32dd) but the ruffles on the hips were not a wanted addition unfortunately. . tried it on three separate times to try to change my mind but in the end, it's going back. i would not suggest it if you have an athletic or hourglass figure with even a little hip.",0
"The image online doesn't depict this blouse well.. my complaint is that the sweater portion looks crooked and shrunken where it has been cut at waist level and the ruffles have been attached at the hips. maybe i received a flawed piece, either way, i'll be sending it in for return.",0
"I wanted so badly to love this dress, but i couldn't get past the thin material that you can actually see through. not for this price anyhow. the dress is shorter than i had anticipated, and more fitted around the waistline flaring out at the bottom which i feel isn't accurately portrayed in the photo. on the positive though, the color is beautiful and the neck line stunning, but alas will be returning.",0
"My daughter loves these, she wears them around the house all day when she doesn't have to go out.",1
"Cute design. runs big in neckline, falls off shoulder exposing bra straps. fabric is very thin. sloppy look on short petite frame. 5'1"" 142lbs 34-36 c/d. purchased a medium. haven't washed it yet, but the fabric doesn't look like it will hold up well. i have kept it to wear as a sleep shirt with thin gray sleep sweats.",0
"Was really excited for this dress and couldn't be more disappointed. doesn't look anything like the pictures.

the fabric feels...cheap. it came wadded up in a ball and is a wrinkled mess. 

looking beyond that, i tried it on and thought i had put it on incorrectly. unfortunately not. the top half doesn't sit correctly. it's so bizarre that it seems like a flaw in the design. it doesn't sit on your shoulders, but doesn't look right off your shoulders. the neckline is very high. also, front b",0
"These jeans really look very nice on. they are 99% cotton and 1% elastaine. if you want the look that you see on this model, order one size up. i am 5'9""/136 lbs. bought both 27 and 28. decided to keep the 28. mainly because the lower part of the leg was fitting too tight in the 27, looked more like a skinny jean but bunched up at the knee -- they are tapered.

"I was really looking forward to this dress. i tried it on and it does not wow like the picture. it came wrinkled, but i think even pressed it would fall weird. the side swoop falls funny, and you can see the seams underneath. and the top front falls funny, not quite sure what to do with it. it almost looks like a mock turtleneck until you fold it down. again, maybe if you get it pressed that would be better. the back is still beautiful though. i'm 5'3"" 115lbs ordered a 0.  maybe on someone talle",0
Too pricey for the quality of this imported product.,0

"I saw this and had to have it!  it is so beautiful.  it has pops of color that can be paired with so many options.  i like the uniqueness of the flowers being on the backside.  it is thinner fabric, so i will have to wear a black cami underneath but i have no problem with that.  especially, going into cooler weather anyway.  it is very flattering on.  this one will go fast.  thank you retailer!",1
"I have gotten so many compliments on this top. it does run very large- i'm normally a large, returned for a medium, which is still a bit on the large size. the small was even still large but much shorter so i loved it so much i just took the medium. it's a 'tent' style or 'trapeze' style which doesn't completely show in the images. super nice, thin linen-like cotton and absolutely beautiful. love it!",1
"This top is fun to wear & looks great with black, grey or my wine color jeans!! love it!",1
"I was really hopeful that this top would work on me because it is so cute online. however, i was very disappointed when i finally received it. the sleeves look soft and snuggy in the picture but are actually a bit stiff and scratchy in person. i could almost get over the sleeves, but the white part of the shirt was horrible. i am 5'10 and a size 6. i wear a size small at retailer, and i got a small in this top. the bottom of the shirt was a tad short on me and hit just below my belt line-- which i",0
"I really wanted this jumpsuit to be my holiday staple! i ordered this jumpsuit in a sz 4 (my typical size) - the jumpsuit doesn't have a waist, i suppose the ribbon created the illusion of a waist. most jumpsuits are super slimming because of having a waistband and this does not besides the bow. also what i found strange is the back zipper goes all the way down passed your bottom - it's the longest zipper i've ever seen. it's very body hugging so it shows your curves if you have any. i will sadl",0
It is a shame when a product such as this is left on the website after so many comments reveal the item to be more defective in production than an opinion of size proportion. i read the reviews so had expected the item to run small so i ordered accordingly...this does not run small-this is not representative of any of the three categories one associates with women's apparel sizing. i am usually a small and the description by previous reviewers described the fit as being perfect for me-very small,0

"I was very excited to receive this dress because of the cute photo. however, upon arrival i was completely disappointed. the color is much more drab than the photo. the smudged polkadots weren't attractive. there were many little bumps and pulls in the linen. the dress is super heavy. the pleats around the waist did not lay correctly.
and it adds 10 pounds to your hips! super sad! i am sending it back.",0
I ordered this dress on a whim in my normal size 8 and if fits perfectly! i felt so pretty when i put it on. i love the volume of the skirt with the tighter top. it was very flattering to me. the linen thickness was nice but not for summer in florida maybe spring. but its lovely!,1
"I ordered this after falling in love with the near-identically-patterned red linen shirtdress - this dress has almost exactly the same construction, but the cloth is slightly heavier-weight, and there is no slip (because the fabric is thick enough to not need one). a few other reviewers mentioned that the cut was ill-fitting or unflattering - obviously, that depends on the wearer's build - this dress seems cut for relatively small-busted people, so i lucked out. i love the classic a-frame outlin",1
"The models pose and description are misleading. this top has absolutely no shape to it. the front of the shirt is kind of like a slub shirt texture, plain black. the back print is nice,just more faded than shown in picture. the entire design has no form. it is huge. also cheaply made.",0
This dress was an adorable a-line in the front and a shift dress (no pleats) in the back. tack onto that a high-low hemline and it's just trying to be too many things. would've loved to see this dress as a true a-line/fit-and-flare. it would've been perfect. fits true to size.,1
I thought this was a sweet design but it is too boxy for me.,0
"I thought this top was so pretty and airy, but it just didn't work out. i typically wear an xl in retailer and was able to size down to a l in this top. i ended up returning because the front is pretty sheer and the black tented out in a weird way about half-way down (there is a seam across and without this it would have hung perfectly). disappointed.",0
"I would never have noticed this from the product shot, it was on the one of a kind rack at my store. the open work that shows off your bralette or a cami is sexy and it has just the right amount of slouch. super comfy. i loved it. bought a medium.",1
Doesn't feel like cotton jersey. feels like a thin version of the seamless cami. it's not soft as i expected. it's much thinner than expected too.,0
Such a cute top! can be dressed up or down. i wore it on sting break and had many compliments.,1
"I loved this shirt! flattering and pretty. it's hand wash only or dry clean. i hand washed it and the blue t-shirt part of the shirt shrank, and now the front of the shirt is too short for me. would not recommend due to shrinkage... too bad.",0
"I tried this one with the free ship/20% without much expectation so i was surprised by this nice piece. i am not usually a fan of sheer shirts, but this one manages to be sheer yet not see through! the black color works that magic. the linen makes this a nicer material rather than the usual knit. i am not usually a linen fan as it gives me the itches, but this is soft and light. the back is really beautiful and brighter colors in person. the balance between the front and back lengths does work a",1
"I had such high hopes for this, but the fit was really strange. i ordered my usual size small, but it is huge. the sides of the top are very wide and boxy, and the back hangs far from my body, very droopy. even if i got a smaller size, the design/fit is not for me. i like the linen front of the blouse, though it is quite sheer. the fabric on the back has a pretty design, but it appears to be stamped on thin black cloth, rather than the richly-colored fabric i saw in the picture. i am truly disap",0
"I couldn't wait to try this on because i love the brand holding horses! this dress did not disappoint! although i detest the difficulty with side zippers (why can't they simply return to the back seam?) i was easily able to pull this dress on because it had some give to the fabric. once on, the dress has a very flattering fit over the bust (the wrap over bodice is already secured with a stitch) and through the tummy. i believe these were sized s,m, l so i took my regular medium.
length wise, par",1
"I'd been eyeing this dress for a while, wondering if it could work for me. i wound up ordering the sp size when it went on sale. its pretty perfect-i am 5'4' and currently 130 lbs. it fits well, if a touch loose in the waist, but i think if i had purchased the xsp it might be too snug through the bust, as it's fairly fitted there. the neckline comes a little lower than i usually wear, which is part of why i wanted to order the petite size rather than the regular (that and the length), but i can",1
"I have come to scoop up basically ever elevenses jumpsuit that they release because they are perfection - always the perfect fit and quality fabric. i'm on the taller side at 5'7"" and found this to fit perfectly, yet somehow it looks equally as perfect on shorter ladies i saw in the dressing room. awesome!",1
"This dress is just very unattractive. it is quite short-waisted, almost empire and so the pockets hit in an odd place. also it is very long - midi length - and the skirt is very wide. the effect is matronly, not cute at all. size-wise it fit true to size and it is a nice medium weight denim and the construction is good.",0
"I first saw this shirt on one of the workers at the retailer stores and it looked beautiful. i loved it so much i had to order it when it came on sale. the fit is a little too short for my liking, but i think i can make it work. also, it does fit a little snug around the arms but it at least it doesn't show your undergarments. overall, i think it is absolutely beautiful. the fabric has a beautiful shimmer to it and it looks easy to dress up for a day at the office or a night on the town, or paired",1
I went into the store not expecting to walk out with this dress. i just happened to try it on in an xs and i loved it. i probably could have gone with a petite because it's long but it didn't bother me enough and i didn't want to wait for it to be ordered. it's nicely fitted through the waist and definitely looks better with a belt. the downside is that the lining is short (mid thigh) and tends to bunch up underneath which then makes it puff out slightly. this didn't bother me enough to return i,1
"Such an adorable and comfortable dress! just love the fit, the design and the comfort of the denim fabric. it's quite flattering, fit's true to size and i can't wait to wear it to casual parties all summer long! highly recommend! lots of
options too with dressing it up a bit more with fun high healed sandals or a pretty shrug and just as nice to wear with flip flops or keds! i 5'5"" and usually a size 4 and it fit true to size....grab it while you still can!",1
This sweatshirt is very cute on. it works well with leggings or skinny jeans. it's the perfect thing to wear when you want to be comfortable but still look feminine.,1
"I agree with the other reviewers about the versatility and the fit of the dress. i am 5'9"" and yes the pockets hit just a tad high, but the fit of the bodice and bust is so great that i am willing to overlook this small flaw. the only thing that has really bothered me about the dress, that i haven't seen anyone else comment on is the slightly strange odor from the denim. maybe it just happens to be my particular dress, but i have noticed this strange smell from a pair of seven jeans i had purcha",1
"I was excited to receive this top and wanted to love it; however, the side ruffles flared out more than i expected. it didn't look right on me so had to return it :(",0
"This tank (in black) is nice quality, most of the fringe hangs straight and seems to be attached well. it's just too short and too boxy for my figure (curvy/hips). would look good on someone who has straight hips and is not long waisted. since that doesn't describe me, it has to go back.",0
"I purchased this in the 6p and the 8p. both fit similar, but the 6p was just a little more form fitting. the problem i have with this top is that while the top of the shirt and the shoulders are awesome, the rest of the top is pretty boxy. i am a 36c, broad shoulders. i did layer it with a longer necklace which helped deter the boxy look. if the mid section could be a little more form fitting, it would be a perfect top! soft, cool fabric, great for summer.",1
"I'm a sucker for plaid. i tried another plaid shirtdress from retailer, and it looked like a housecoat on me. this is lovely - a bit fitted, but very relaxed and casual. i'll be able to dress it up for casual days at work. it's got enough lovely details to be stylish. i think the waist looks a bit simple, so a belt helps dress it up. the sleeves finish with a button, so it looks polished, or they can be rolled up. i love it with booties!",1
"Every single time i was in a store, this dress caught my eye. there was never a large or xl to try on; however, so when a free shipping offer came up, i took a chance and ordered both. the xl was too large; the large was much better, but a little snug, so if it shrunk, i would have been out of luck. if i would have kept one, it would have been the large; however, they are both going back. a plaid dress sounds like a good idea for the winter when you look at it on the hanger, but on a body, it is",0
"Because of my body type, i never thought i could wear a romper. i tried this on out of curiosity and am so glad i did. it fits well (i did size up because of my thighs), is comfortable, and an alternative to a dress. the patterned bottom did not accentuate my lower body, which was a worry. i got compliments when i wore this to dinner with a pair of sandals.",1
"Like some other reviewers, i, too, have to comment on the dress's fit. the dress doesn't fit right around the bust or the waist. as a seamstress myself, i know that the problem is that it doesn't have any darts in the bust, and thus the bust and the waist are just about the same size. this dress really just needed a few of these extra hidden details to fit right. while a belt helps, i don't think it helps enough to justify the price. it's too bad--i think the concept of it is cool, and i was rea",0
"I want to love this dress. it's cute and fits well...except that the hem has been taken out! it looks like it had a hem that was removed, and they left the crease remnant and frayed edge. looks very sloppy on the bottom. to keep this dress, i would have to pay a seamstress to hem it, and i don't want to pay extra money for something that should already be done.",0
Dress is awesome and makes you look skinnier.,1
"Strapless dresses can be so flattering so when i saw this on retailer i had to order it! this dress did not disappoint. for reference i ordered a size 4 and i am 5'5"", 135 lbs, 34b chest. in the chest area it fits perfectly, while the ribcage area is a little snug, but not uncomfortably so. the pockets are great. the denim quality is great. and i like the frayed bottom of dress. i got compliments straight away on the beauty of the dress from two men. which i thought was quite interesting because i",1
"I bought this top in two colors because i need more statement tops and thought the colors were different enough for a really great top. i have only worn the ivory so far and love it. comfortable, great style and solid quality so the fringe isn't fraying or falling out.

if i could change one thing it would be the itchiness around the neck opening. it's not horrible but it can be distracting and mildly uncomfortable.

i am really happy with the tops and can't wait to start wearing the black one t",1
"This denim dress is best worn by someone over 5' 8"". i had to spend a lot to have it taken up and it still doesn't look that great. so if you don't want to pay over $200 once altered, do not buy this dress.

the best part of the dress is the top. it was true to size on top.",0
"I ordered this dress in a size 6. for reference i am 5'7"", 145 lbs. i love it! the fit is perfect. unlike other reviews, i was aware the hem was unfinished, and i like the look. the top part does not seem to short. the style, to me is kinda retro. i wore the dress with flip-flops and a large chunky necklace. i received lot's of compliments, it is my favorite dress right now!",1
"These are truly slouchy leggings. i am short (5'3) so they do bunch quite a bit for me but when paired with a long chunky sweater they are perfect! unlike the other review, i felt that they ran a little on the larger side. i am typically an 8/10 and ordered the m/l. they sit nicely on my lower waist and do not sag but the length is long long long. i recommend these for wearing out or around the house.",1
"I got these in the neutral color & quickly understood why they're categorized as ""loungewear"". if you're going to wear them out of the house, wear a tunic or a dress over them. i folded the scrunch part up over my calves & wore them like boot socks when i went out. i got a m/l & they fit about on par with other leggings / tights of that size range.

when i got home, i rolled them down & put the bottoms over my heels. the rest of the bottoms scrunched around my ankles. i recommend them for around",1
Beautiful flattering blouse,1
"This dress is beautiful as pictured on the model. but on me, not so much. i am normally a size 0/00 with a 32b bra size. i ordered this dress in an xs and it was just too big and boxy. i also thought the material was going to be thicker, but it was very thin and didn't seem to fall right on my body. beautiful design, just not the right material or fit.",0
"The simplicity of this t-shirt will go with jeans, shorts, or anything casual. the macrame and bead details give it that extra style. i bought the red and white, and love them both. the red is warm and bright, with pink undertones. despite the boxiness of the fit, it ran true to size for me. i did not think it was too big; its meant to be loose and slouchy rather than fitted.",1
"I read the other review that said the shirt was boxy, i didn't think it would be a terribly big deal. unfortunately, it is. normally i wear a size s, so i sized down o an xs. the shirt fits in the sleeves and neckline, but the shirt is still very box and now super short. unfortunately, this is going back. not a good fit. adorable details but the fit is terrible.",0
"I'm 5'5, 145lbs and i'm usually a small/medium depending on the vendor. i bought this shirt in a red, medium and love it. yes, it's boxy and a little big but lays nicely and i think it's meant to be a bit big. i've worn a black cami underneath and the shoulder hangs off a little to the side giving a little extra sexy look to it. this shirt washes well per instructions, didn't shrink or loose it's shape and i've washed it three times now. i've had many compliments on how cute this shirt is, love",1
"Cute design. details on shoulder make the tshirt more special but it runs large so that kind of takes away from the styling. got it on super sale, so i'll keep it. maybe a wash will shrink it a bit...",1
"The metal detail @ the shoulders is the perfect touch to an otherwise ordinary tee. 
regarding sizing. i am 5' 4"", 36dd and i usually have to buy l in tops and make alterations. after reading the other reviews i ordered a m & s. because my shoulders are narrow the s fit better. front measurement shoulder to hem is 24"" on both the s and the m. plenty of length for me. i also wasn't looking for a tight fit around the waist and tucking in just the front as shown on the model looks great. i saw thi",1
"I received this blouse for christmas and it is just gorgeous! it fit true to size, and goes with my whole romantic, feminine style that i have without being overly girly. not too sheer, so no need for a tank underneath, and being that it is neutral, it will go with just about everything i own! love it!",1
"I had bee struggling to find a romper with longer length shorts, it seems like so many of the rompers have short shorts for the bottom half and i wanted something to hit upper mid leg, something like a 4"" inseam on a short. on a whim i ordered this and hoped it would be long enough and sure enough it is perfect. still stylish and still ""short"" for summer without it being so short on the bottom. well made! nice closure at bust so there is no gaping.",1
"I would not have tried this on or ordered it by myself, but my stylist brought it over for me to try (as it was on promotion). well, ok, i get it, i actually liked it on, but the regular size was too big in the arm hole... thinking of it, i should have ordered the xxs... maybe i will.

flattering style, comfrotable fabric, really nice overall...",1
"I was really excited about this dress. i had only seen it online and it looked like the perfect transitional piece, casual or dress up. when it arrived in the mail, the feel of the fabric was great and i slipped it on and it was so comfy i felt like i was wearing a nightdress. unfortunately it hung like that, too. the material sags in places it shouldn't. i have a 5'8"" 125 lb frame, and i ordered an extra small, and both my husband and sister said it was unflattering and urged me to send it back",0
"I love the cut of this shirt! interesting back, and it hangs nicely.....surprisingly flattering! i'm usually a small and needed the xs in this shirt, fyi. very soft, and overall just very pleased with this purchase! i bought it in the denim as well!",1
"This is an all-purpose outfit, well-made, good material. it can be worn many ways.",1
"This wash is so beautiful but i found the rise too long for me. so happy i found them in 24p here on the site. they are wonderful but i'd like to caution with respect to proportions:

i have long legs (for a petite, ha!) and a petite upper body. these jeans almost entirely differ with respect to length. so id say if the your torso is fairly true to a regular fit, and your legs are shorter, you totally save on hemming the regular fit jeans. like another reviewe noted, hemming will reduce the fl",1
I thought this suit would be the perfect solution of stylish but forgiving of my new mom bod. this one didn't work for me. i ordered the medium. the top is very small--i would recommend only for b cup or smaller. the full coverage bottoms did nothing for my shape. it seemed to make me seem rounder and shorter. sending this one back! i did find success same size in a faux wrap style retailer suit.,0
"This shirt flows beautifully and the fabric is almost wrinkle free. i also love that it's the perfect weight and not too low cut, and that the buttons are covered. however, the stitching started to come undone the first time a wore it! i didn't even wash the shirt yet. sadly, i don't think i can recommend this shirt, though maybe give it a try- i might have got a defective one. oh this shirt also seems to run a bit large through the body, but it still looks great. i hope this helps!",0
"Love this! when i first saw it online, i thought it was a bit pricey for a plain white shirt. but i finally gave in and ordered it! i'm so glad i did! i've worn it twice in one week so it won't be difficult to get my money's worth! it's very soft and fits perfectly. looks great with jeans or dress pants. i like to tuck the front in my pants and leave the back out.",1
"I was so excited to try this on after having discovered it on the retailer app and stepping into the store and seeing it. on the hanger it looked alright, but once i slipped it on, it's like everything i've got going for me disappeared. granted, i'm s little bottom heavy, so these types of dresses don't typically flatter my body type anyways.",0
"I tried this on in gray while in store, it was the cuff detailing that initially attracted me. once i tried it on there wasn't a lot i loved about it so it didn't leave with me but now that it's on sale, it's the perfect choice. i'm wearing a medium in the photo, and the only real downfall is how long the arms are on me and i have long arms. maybe sizing down would help but i fear i have too much winter weight to hide to take a small. for reference, i'm 5'6"", 145 lbs curvy hourglass, generous hi",1
"Comfy, but constantly picking pills off of it, from first wear.",1
This tunic is super comfy and will look great with leggings or skinny jeans. i absolutely love the detailing on the sleeves. i am so glad i ordered this item!,1
"This jacket is soft, a beautiful color, the perfect length, and incredibly versatile (a fleece jacket that doubles as a blazer) but i was swimming in it! i wouldn't have minded the larger size, but the sleeves looked ridiculous. i wish i'd ordered early enough to try a petite size, but i'm not sure that would've helped. sad to send this back!",0
This color rich pattern will transition nicely into the fall season. it wears well with a bare leg and will look great with opaque tights later in the season. the higher waist and gathering work well on my figure.,1
The lengths is what drew me to this top. i love the simple look of the cowl neck. nice detail to the sleeve that creates a more than casual look.,1
Great colors and not too voluminous. lined whig will be great for fall but the downsides are the huge elastic waist bc it'll require a belt or something over it (looks v casual alone) and even with a perfect fit it gives a bit of muffin just bc it's a huge piece of elastic. i've literally tried this on on two occasions trying to convince myself it it. lol but it's not worth it at the current price.,0
"This jacket is cozy, warm, and very cute, but after the 1st washing (according to the manufacturer's instructions) it began to pill and has worsened each time.",0
Beautiful fall/winter piece! so soft and comfy!! was unsure about it when i saw it online but once i saw it in store and got to try it on and feel it i could not put it down! i felt you could definitely size down!,1
"I purchased this, and it ended up sitting in my closet for a couple of weeks. i bought it in the green, and i felt it did nothing to enhance my figure. it's kind of a boring design. i like the cowl neck (rare on a tunic) and the sleeve details. the colors don't seem to go well with standard black leggings. overall, unimpressed.",0
"The button fell off when i took it out of the bag, and i noticed that all of the thread had unraveled. will be returning :-(",0
"I agree with a previous reviewer who said that it was very nicely cut, but unfortunately, the materials are so cheap. the ""fleece"" material that it is made out of feels like the cheap polyester fleece blankets that you get at the discount stores. it will pill easily, and is noticeable even in the dark color. i must have gotten one shipped straight from the store, and it was already starting to do some gnarly pilling. i do love the cut of it, but i can't justify keeping it because this won't last",0
"I ordered a small, but it was way to big. it was very soft.",0
"I have wanted a fleece jacket for ages (for warmth and practicality), but i'm not the sporty type. this is the perfect alternative! i got it in wine and use it over a cardigan and dress or jeans. it is a lovely color and passes as wool. this is one of the best things i've ever purchased at retailer. highly recommended. btw, it runs quite big. i'm generally a medium to large but the small is perfect on me.",1
"These were so perfect for the first hour or so. i was convinced they were my new favorite pants! but their initial forgiveness turned into a slovenly stretch, and they creased and wrinkled like crazy after i'd been sitting a couple hours. it looked downright embarrassing - saggy and wrinkly (radiating from the crotch, no less) . i got them in the gray, and it's possible that other colors use different, less awful fabric.",0
"Such a beautiful, well-made dress! the color of the dress is slightly more pink in person -- a very pale pink. the lining is an off-white color. it fits very well, aside from being a bit long (i'm 5' and ordered the xxs petite). so glad paper crown is making xxs p now!",1
Morher jeans are my favourite! they are soft and fit great. make my saggy butt look good! they do stretch with wears but shrink again in the wash. they do shrink quite a bit so don't dry all the way! i recommend mother to all!,1
"This top was a disappointment for me. it was beautiful but because of the material it is made out of, it will stretch out as you wear it and not regain it's shape. it is also a little heavy for day time during summers in the south.... but the weight of it was not so much of a concern as the ability to retain its shape.",0
I purchased a petite size which fit great except for the slip. the slip is at least 2 inches shorter than dress. super comfy and flattering! perfect for fall with at pair of booties.,1
"I have a holding horses dress similar to this one from about a year ago.  i loved the swinging fit without it looking like a maternity dress.   the fit and style of this dress is wonderful, it's the color that killed it for me.   i ordered the ""orange"" because i liked the photo on the model.  when the dress arrived in the mail, i could hardly take it out of the package and try it on.   the color is almost neon orange.   too much for this redhead.  hard to wear that bright neony color.  not sure",0
"This dress ran small in the arms for me. when i returned it for a bigger size, the dress i got had a huge rip in the decorative threading on the back. i can't believe the product wasn't checked for flaws this huge before shipping. i asked for another one in the same size. we'll see if it, too, is defective",0
This was completely different than i expected. the xs/s was so large that it looked messy. unfortunately i had to return it.,0
"I loved this dress and it fit perfectly. i did not have any issue with the camisole being tight, and i am really curvy. i did however have a problem trying to take it off. it has no zipper and in order for me to get it over my head i had to stretch my shoulders to the point where i ripped the back. i went to the store and tried on the larger size and ripped that one too. i tried to take it off more delicately but i couldn't. maybe it was me, but this dress is too much hassle. if i went any highe",0
"When i saw this blouse online i thought it looked like a great combination of casual with the elegance of an intricate print. i was so disappointed when it came. the print is not centered in the front or the back. it looks like they were trying to save on the material and just cut it out wherever with no thought to symmetry. for this price the detail of centering the design was expected, especially because this is how it appeared in the picture. loved the blouse, but i will be returning it becau",0
As the other reviewer stated the dress is not lined and the fabric feels very cheap. i tried the sp as well and felt i could have gone down to the xsp. i like the style and coloring but given the price and lack of quality this is going back.,0
"Saw this tunic on line and when it was immediately sold out i thought it had to be a winner. after several days of trolling on line the 2p was finally back in stock. now comes the disappointment. yes, the material is sheer but would be a nice weight for humid summer days. the front looked exactly like the model. cut with high side slits that truly made this a tunic. the back of this tunic is some sort of origami design. the fabric bunches out at the butt area. it's bad when you're standing and i",0
"This shirt has beautiful coloring but the material wasn't as soft as i thought it would be. i was hoping they would be the super soft material, maybe washing them would help, but i didn't want to chance it so i returned them.",0
"The skirt is totally see through unless you wear a slip. even though it has a built in slip, it is still see through. the problem is that the slip is made out of the same super thin polyester material as the outside skirt. if it wasn't see through i would keep it.",0
"This is a beautiful and warm sweater, well cut and easy to dress up or down. the biggest problem is the extreme shedding which looks messy against darker clothing, especially against wool or cashmere winter coats.",0
"I purchased this dress yesterday and it's cute and fits great, but the embroidery across the back ripped as soon as i moved my arms. it's really delicate and strains anytime you lift your arms overhead or forward. i'm keeping it anyway because the supersoft pretty slip that come with it is worth the sale price.",0
"I loved the color and the neckline was flattering. however, it would have fit me better in a petite size bc i am 5'3"" and a 32f. it fits slim so to fit in my bust it was too long. also didn't think the fabric was good quality for this price.",0
Nice dress to wear while seasons are transitioning,0
"Loved this dress online, but my small pettie stature made me looks like an orphan from the prairie.",0
"I loved the colors on this dress, but i don't like the way it fits. it is tight around the shoulders, but the rest of the dress is really big and has no shape",0
"Just received and sorry to return. i am 5'9"" i wear a size 8 i ordered the m/l . it way really big and to wide",1
Horrible fit. i do not understand why they but a aline dress with a skin non aline camisole under the dress.,0
"Was excited to receive this dress as i got it at a great price on sale. the colors are great and it fits pretty good, but it came without a slip!!  so disappointing to not receive the entire dress!!  hence the 2 stars. may send it back for this reason.",0
"Tried this on in store with red ag ankle jeans and the only thing i could do was chuckle. it looked like a sleeveless lab coat or butchers coat. take your pick this styling was not for me. the fabric is nice not flimsy. you can see whatever pants your wearing underneath but i guess that's a moot point since it does have a substantial side slit. it does run tts. i'm 5'3ish, 118# and the size 2 fit ok. probably would have sized up to the 4 because a slight pull at the chest (34d-dd). in the end i",0
This is a nice flowy dress that i plan to wear in the fall with long boots. i love how light it feels.,1
"The pattern is very cute!  from the front i liked it, but when i turn to the side, you can see just how voluminous it is.  it ended up looking a bit tenty.  if it had just a bit more shape it would be perfect.  in the end, not the most flattering.",1
Most comfortable and great looking! i got complements from everyone! literally!,1
"This arrived in my store this morning and it is as cute as it appears online!! i'm a curvy gal so i honestly wasn't feeling like this would look good on me. but it is thick and the fabric is sturdy so it lays on me exactly the way it does on the model! the fabric on the blue side almost has a vinyl feel to it...like it would be rainproof! the sherpa layer is super soft and in my opinion, even cuter than the blue side! the trim is all lined with a faux leather and the ties on each side can be adj",1
I really loved this in the catalog. the fabric and details are very pretty. however it's a lot of fabric without much form. my husband suggested it for maternity (not realizing it has fitted slip). not for curvy/ hourglass.  had to send it back.,0
"I ordered this dress is in the yellow/orange. the colors are pretty, the pink detail is nice and that's about it. the slip underneath is a form fitting yellow cotton - no big deal. the dress itself runs very large and in an unflattering way. if i was pregnant, it was perfect. the material feels cheap to me and this, along with the roomy fit - is why this dress will be returned.",0
"Usually i'd wait for a sale on rayon loungewear but i would have gladly paid more if this was cotton or silk! despite the poor fabric, the design is light and beautiful with a high quality floral print that's distinctive and elegant. i can wear this with a thin strappy slip or a lacy cami bra or with a cardigan, jacket and lacy boy shorts. an retailer employee wore this chemise under a denim shirtdress and belted the whole outfit together--it was perfection. i purchased size m and my figure is 39-",1
"This is a beautiful dress. however, it looked awful on me. i ordered the medium and it was huge. also, i looked 7 months pregnant. not a good style for the short person.",0
"I ordered this shirt in the xl in both colors and i am in love! as a large chested lady, with a bit extra around the middle, this shirt is super flattering and perfect for everyday summer weather. i'm sure i will be wearing this all summer. yay retailer!",1
"Luckily i bought this on sale... i now see the instructions online say to hand wash, but i bought mine in the store. the instructions on the tag said to wash delicate in cold water and tumble dry. i washed it in cold water and it shrunk to doll size.",0
"I love this tunic! perfect for the beach or by the pool! gorgeous design and even better in person! light weight, i am usually a small/medium and originally bought the small but ended up returning for the medium so i had a little more room up top for wearing over my swimsuit.",1
"This is a beautiful suit. was looking for a one piece. i ordered online. it is definitely high quality, but i ended up returning it. the colors seemed much more muted than the picture shows. i loved the fit, just wasn't as striking as i expected.",0
"This sweater is very nice. i bought it online recently with a discount on the discount and felt i got an amazing bargain. it is not larger than expected, but is not exactly the fit the model's picture implies. it is a roomier design. nonetheless, it is well-made and all wool, instead of that mystery mix of fibers that sometimes is the case with things described as ""wool"". the one thing that might be more discouraging to online buyers is that the color is not the lovely blue the picture depicts,",1
"I really love the look and style of these. i am not a fan of thong underwear; definitely prefer these bikini or ""hipster"" styles, but sometimes it's hard to find them in attractive design. this pair is definitely attractive and i like how they fit and look a lot. i've only worn them once and they held up well for the day -- i often find lace can rip on the first wear, so i was wary. they did okay, but i do worry that they seem delicate enough i could accidentally stuck a thumb through it and rip",1
"I tried this on even though i usually am not interested in cowlneck tops. the fabric is heavier, so it is not good for hot weather. the fabric is a weave of lighter and darker colors - you can see if you zoom in, so it has an interesting texture. very flattering because it is fitted and not boxy.",1
"I was planning on wearing this at the office but it looks like a maternity blouse. not flattering at all. i loved the concept.. silky, loose fitting, professional.. but they didn't succeed. its a big mess. return.",0
"Oh such a classic retailer look for summer! a vintage pattern on a crisp cotton fabric. i was immediately drawn to it. but wait- there is a sort of wrap around tie at the waist, creating the look of an apron. yes. it looks like one is wearing a full apron. or scrub dress. 
why?? this would have been sooo much better as a simple shift or a skirt/blouse combo.",0
"The material is adorable and if it was available in a blouse with sleeves, i would buy in a minute. we have a pool and i thought it would be cute to wear while entertaining. now the cons, i am long waisted and this strange tie knotted high under the bustline giving an odd lumpy look. it runs short and i can't imagine who thought this design was a good idea. there were no reviews when i ordered. i am learning to try it on in the store and/or read the reviews before investing. i would say go up a",0
"This sweater is pretty, fits tts, feels soft against the skin and has a good weight to it so cami is absolutely not needed. i particularly like the buttons on the side. you could unbutton to have the sweater feel more swingy and show more of the underlayer. the design in the back is simple and flattering for all figures, i think. this shade of gray is also appealing to me as it's not too light or dark and has a hint of periwinkle undertone to it. the sweater is on the shorter side but i do think",1
"The sweater fits a bit awkward in the front. it draped more than i would have liked. also, the transition from the stripes to the solid gray felt non cohesive because of the stitching. returned the item.",0
"I loved the look of the dress. it's a very flattering design. however, i absolutely hate the side zipper. every time i have worn it, the zipper will get stuck and it is a struggle to get it up. the side tie is a very cute touch, but you definitely have to figure out the best way to tie it, so you don't have a huge bump of fabric on your back. having said all this, i still did get a lot of compliments from this dress. i do wish the dress had a lining.",1
"I bought this dress as soon as i received the retailer catalogue. i rushed to the store because i absolutely fell in love with it. when i tried it on, i went a complete size down. i'm usually an 8, but i snagged this beauty in a 6. the top part really does run larger, so unless you have really broad shoulders, you'll need to size down. the sleeves hit my arms at a nice place, and the little tie in the front is awesome, because not only is it an interesting detail, it can be loosened or tightened d",1
"Totally bummed. the pretty print doesn't outweigh the very odd fit of this dress. makes you look really top heavy and even the print, which looks so cute online, looks muddled in person. sadly, went right back.",0
"I really liked this dress in pictures online. i wanted to wear it to work on casual fridays. everything about this dress was a disappointment, especially at this price point. the fit was weird: tight in some places, too loose in others (i'm usually xs or s, i ordered this one is s). it's made out of a fairly thick and warm material, yet the neck area of the dress is more exposed than it appears in pictures, especially in the back, making it awkward to have this very warm dress with neck, upper b",0
"I love this sweater. i found it in the sale section a few weeks ago but wasn't sure if it would be too bulky. it had a dark smudge on the collar left from someone or something. i thought maybe it had been left behind by others for that reason because the quality was so nice. thankfully, i washed it and the smudge came out. 


i live in houston, tx and don't need to wear wool or cashmere sweaters for warmth. this is mostly cotton. it is well made. the sleeves were longer on me than the model,",1
I have been looking for a basic ivory sweater. i waited for this one to go on sale. the style is cute but the sweater itself is very stiff and heavy. unfortunately i decided to return it.,0
I really wanted to love this piece but it was very large. i'm 5'2 and ordered xs/s and i have return due to size.,0
"I loved the print on this top in navy from the picture, and loved it even more in person. it is gorgeous, and the top feels high quality. that said, as usual with maeve clothing it fit me strangely. i am curvy with a small upper body (34 d) but larger bust, and maeve tops are almost always too tight in the bust and too flowy around the middle , which creates a pregnant look on me at least. i feel their fit model must be small busted, so for small busted ladies this top would be lovely. i always",1
"I love the print on this. love. and the fit, for a swing blouse, was super flattering! typically i haven't found that to be true, but this one is so nice! i loved it so much, but i just couldn't find a ton of outfits to wear with such a unique piece. i have been trying to slim my closet so i did return this, but perhaps would purchase it on sale (to justify wearing it less). i typically wear a 4 in tops and dresses and took an xs.",1
"What a fun print to have on a dress, let alone a sweet off white lace confection like this one. i really love the design and all the nice high quality touches. because i am busty and there is no stretch, i sized up. my only wish was that the look of the skirt wasn't so innocent..the flounce looks a bit juvenile, especially at my age. i'll try to figure out how to flatten it , maybe wet the skirts like a regency lady ;) here are my stats since i purchased 12p: 5'3"" 145# 36dd.",1
Remember those cable-knot cotton sweaters that were popular in the eighties?! that's exactly what this sweater is. everywhere your body bends like elbows is emphasized by the fact that cotton does not bounce back like other finer fabrics like wool and cashmere. i'll pass on this!,0
"I made a visit to the store specifically to try on this dress and it was a disappointment for me. i tried on size 6 regular (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips) and i could not zip the dress up half way. the zipper is on the side, but it's more to the back which i have to stretch my arms all the way back to reach it. it stopped at my waist and was too tight for me to zip up anymore. i tried on an 8 regular and the entire dress was huge. (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). i like the regular size because the l",1
"I tried this dress on in the store, prepared to buy this lovely piece. i feel that it should have been a few inches longer, it would look more proportionate. next, the tie is really difficult to place, but it creates some great detail to the front and back. it wrinkles easily, i can see it would need to be ironed before each wear. lastly it is not lined, what a bummer, at least the skirt could be lined. but, it does have pockets, that is sweet.",0
"I was thoroughly underwhelmed. it did not hang well, and the fit seemed off. the tie waist just sort of hung there. i could have sized down, but i didn't even want to bother. it was pretty boring and flimsy for $138.",0
"This is different from any bra i've had before, in a good way. the lace over the front is really beautiful, and no annoying straps means it's comfortable! fit and support are both great. i didn't notice that it was silk when i ordered, so it was a nice surprise to open something so luxe and elegant. i wasn't expecting an underwire, either, based on the s-m-l sizing, but it has one.",1
"I love the dress overall, however, found it a tad snug in the bust area. overall, a beautiful dress to own.",1
"This top looks just like you see it on the website - design is super cool and color is awesome, almost acid washed in areas. but know that this top is super, super thin and will not provide any warmth. i wish it were a bit thicker in fabric, it would have been perfect for the cool fall and going into winter especially for the price. the medium in this one fit me better than the small. i am 5'9 and 140 lbs.",1
"In the quest to find comfy, cute, casual tops i took a change on this one. it's cute but quite oversized. it just overwhelmed me. i ordered the large and generally wear medium or large so you can safely size down at least a size or two and still get the fit shown on the model. the style and color just didn't suit my coloring or body type,  but i still recommend because it's comfortable and different enough to be a nice addition to someone else's closet.",1
"The design of this sweater is odd. it made me feel very ""round"" when i put it on. the sleeves were wide. the other reviewers were correct in saying that it's a thick sweater, which i thought i'd like. the torso was slimmer and longer than i expected. it really was the odd design of the sleeves that made me not like this sweater.",0
"I found this dress to run large (like the other reviewers have mentioned). the quality is really nice, and the sweater fabric is a nice touch. it hit me right above the knee, and i an 5'5"". it is a purplish pink (as pictured). if it fits you properly, you will be pleased with the quality, color and unique style.",0
"I loved how the skirt looked on the model, but when i tried in on it had no shape on me. i usually wear a size 6 and received a size 4 which was large on me. also, the material feels rough which i was not expecting as it is advertised as a silk skirt. i was really looking forward to wearing this skirt but it is just not i thought it was - i expect better quality from retailer.",0
"I'm 5'5"" and got the m. i thought i'd need the petite but i decided to try on the regular m in the store and the length was fine (mid calf). i gave a 3 for quality though because all the ones in my store were tearing in the back where the shoulders meet the back. i bought it anyway because it looked like an easy fix and it was so darn cute and comfortable on!",1

Not for the curvy women. fit in the waist but bunched around the crotch,1

absolutely my new favorite. buy this. you won't be disappointed. the neck is soft and not irritating at all like the other reviewer said.
love love.
look how big the hood is if you so want.",1
"I got my normal size and unfortunately the moment i tried it on the details on both shoulders ripped. the dress fit fine and i basically have no boobs so i don't think it was a case of it being too small. i guess it just wasn't reinforced enough. there was also a miss-stitch in the shoulder on the back which causes the back of the dress to bunch funnily. lastly, there's a slip on the inside which i don't think was necessary. it hugs tight to the body and makes the whole dress feel oddly clingy.",0
"Soft, very thin material. perfect for summer but very difficult to wear without a bra because it is so thin it shows quite a bit. the chest is tight but you can adjust the fit by the neck tie. looks exactly like on the model but the cut made me feel wide. had to take it back.",0
"Thanks to the vertical stripes, the adjustable neckline, the bow that cinches the waist, and the free flowing skirt, this dress is extremely flattering. the compliments i received when wearing this dress back that up! i was unsure if i should order a medium or large because i typically wear either/or depending on the dress style due to my hips. i ordered a large which fit thanks to the adjustable neckline and adjustable waist, but a medium definitely would have worked just as well for me (i just",1
"I just love sleeping on snow sweaters and this one is no exception. it's soft and cozy and very warm. i do have sensitive skin, so i found this a bit itchy right away, but that went away after i wore it for a bit. this is oversized, but in a great way. you could size down if you wanted something a bit more fitted. sleeves are long and pre-cuffed. sweater hit me mid-lower thigh.",1
"I never would have thought that i could wear a jumpsuit and it actually look good on me, but this is it!!! the fabric is weighted some so it lays very flattering and is very comfortable. the sash can be tied several ways-front, back, or side. i will be traveling in this to the beach and pairing it with an retailer wrap, and then wearing it alone with sandals once we exit the freezing airplanes. a racer back bra works great with this piece and the pockets are an added bonus. it looks like a d",1
"I wanted a casual but special summer dress and had high hopes for this one. i normally like to try things on as it is difficult to tell fit online. when it arrived i was disappointed with this dress. it is very full in the skirt, the top fit a bit odd, not a lot of shape and not especially flattering. the fabric wasn't very exciting either.  unfortunately this one went back.",0
"I personally love this romper. there's a lot of fabric to it, so it feels lush and substantial. and the pockets! they're so roomy i actually couldn't find my phone for a hot second. the crotch of the legs (because, yes, this thing is actually pants) is very long and so i was very comfortable sitting.

the two things i don't love about this piece include the downfall of all rompers imo: not bathroom-break friendly. you basically have to disrobe. and since the legs are so long, you end up clingi",0
"After reading every review, i was certain i knew exactly what i was getting with this dress. wrong. i sized up from a small to a medium and the dress was still uncomfortably tight on my rib cage. the top is very exposing of the bust, and i'm small busted. i can't stand wearing camis, so there no way i'd be able to wear this dress even if i sized up again to a large. for reference, i'm 5'6"", a straight build 134 lbs, and wear a 6. pluses on this dress are, i loved the green color and length of sk",0
"I love the feminine feel and look of this skirt. it is unique and matches many different shirts and looks great with a jacket. the only thing is it does run large. i ordered a 6 (my usual size) and it is very loose, not form fitting like the photo, but still cute and wearable. downsizing would've been better.",1
I had to return this because the lining is super short and uneven. its shorter in the back and falls weird. i love the color even better than the picture. but quality is lacking for this high price. i ordered the 4 petite and it fit but the elastic waist shows any bump in your tummy too. bummer,0
"The print and fabric are great, but this dress has odd construction, or maybe i have an odd construction. anyway, i'm 5-5, weigh 125-130, 36d. i ordered the small and it fit perfect up top and in the arms - but the issue was in the hips. i'm somewhere between athletic and curvy. the skirt looks more a-line in the photo, but it's actually cut pretty straight. spanx would have helped, but i'm not about to wear spanx all day in a work/casual dress, i think a medium would make the top too big, so i",0

I ordered the navy/gray combo in size xl. it was too heavy and uncomfortable to wear. it also attracted so much lint. the one i received must have come from a store because it already had a lot of fuzz on it. it added weight and was unflattering for my shape. the colors do match the photos online. the length also matches the model's photos. it just didn't work for me.,0

"This is my first pair of pilcro pants but defiantly not my last. i always have a hard time trying to decide between a regular length and a tall because at 5'10"" i usually fall somewhere in between. i ordered the regular length and couldn't b happier, they are just long enough to wear a shorter heal with or a pair of flats. the beige color is really nice and pairs nicely with the sky blue mock turtleneck sweater i also ordered from retailer. i love the retro 70's style too! i couldn't be happier wi",1
"The skirt is not as form fitting as i had hoped. it is a lot of material that is flowy and billowy, not straight and pencil-like as shown as in the pictures. the material and design is just okay- not super wowed by it. i did size down but feel like i might need to size down even more to get more of a fitted look.",0
"I absolutely love this. i'm 115, 5'6"" and the xs is roomy because of the style, but it drapes very nicely and it's a perfect fit. with my new loafers and cropped pants, i'm all ready for fall! he slightly felted knit is a nice touch. it's also really soft.",1
"So these look so good online - i love flare and the button detail. however, on me, they were very long (which i knew) but too thigh-hugging for my taste, and the buttons looked cheap (i ordered the tan color). thus, back they went. for reference, i am 5'5"" and 125# and ordered the 6.",0
"You can?t go wrong with this one. it?s is super flattering. the size medium fit perfectly. for reference, i have a 38in chest (32 ff) and in the medium i was not over exposed, and it can be worn with a racing back bra with it not showing. i wish it came i more colors. please retailer?make this one in more colors.",1

"I bought this jacket in a regular and returned it to the store where they had a petite, it is lovely.  i live in ca so it is perfect for an evening out.... remember not to buy this for warmth but a light cover up.  it makes an outfit out of anything else you might want to wear.  looks great with black under it or off white.... also looks great with the beautiful soft pinks that are out this season... or cranberry.... you will love it...",0
Absolutely love this cardi! it's perfect with nice jeans and boots or my black pants. i am nearly 6' tall and a medium is plenty long in the sleeve and overall length. it adds warmth but it's breathable so it doesn't give you the super hot effect when going inside. they only reason i gave a 4 in quality is that it is loosely stitched so you can get caught on things :) otherwise it is a great addition to my closet!,1
"This is a pretty dress, but the cut is quite boxy. i had thought that the dress would cut in a bit along the body and then ""flare out"" more around the waist down to the hem; however, the dress is baggy from the sleeves all the way down, which lends to a rather unflattering look.",0
"Based on the photos, i thought this dress would be very flattering on an hourglass shape. i ordered the faded reddish pink color. the color was true to the photo and very pretty and soft. the dress has an open neckline, fitted waist and skirt length that are all flattering, but the fabric is thin and clingy, making the dress overall not flattering on anyone not as thin as the model. it certainly doesn't hang. i believe it runs true to size. i'm generally a xs/s and i ordered a s and the fit was",0
This fit me perfectly with a little room but think it's meant to be this way so easier to get on and off. this feels like a dream and is very good quality. definitely a heavier piece but i like that. it is so very flattering and drapes beautifully to hide my tummy. the back is adorable too! retailer hit it out of park with this one! grab it before it's too late! i'm a 36ddd and size 14 and the large fit perfectly,1
Just a heads up - this is a romper - pants and not a dress! you can't tell from the pictures. i ordered thinking it was a dress but it's actually ... culottes? i'm not sure what you would call it. the pull on styling was awkward and the sash was bulky. it definitely goes back!,0
"The quality and fabric of this dress are lovely, but unfortunately i found it to be very unflattering and shapeless. it fit me like a sack, i ordered the m and i suppose i should've sized down, but even in the s i'm afraid this would be far too large. for reference, i am 5'7 and 135 lbs. i have a curvy build so this shape dress just wasn't right on me. i imagine it will look cute on more of a boyish figure. returned.",0
"I saw this online and went to the store yesterday to find it. i tried on a m, which is my normal size, and a s, which, if clothes are baggy, i'll buy for a more fitted look. the s was too small in the shoulders and my arm movement was restricted, so i bought the m. this is definitely true to size. it has a blousy waist to it, so no amount of downsizing will make this a fitted jacket. notice the model is pushing the jacket down with her hands in the pockets to make it look like it has a more defi",1
"I love this! it is comfortable, flowing and reminds me of glamorous women in 1970's movies. i especially love that is completely looks like a shirt (its pants) because i don't have to worry about my skirt flying up as i race around the city. bra// no bra doesn't matter, which i love. as someone with a larger bottom then top and am pretty tall, i usually have trouble finding one piece items that aren't too short in the crotch/waist zone. very roomy without looking like a sack.",1

"I've never owned a romper, and never had any desire to. but the classy design in black, soft, flowy fabric reeled me in, prompting me to push my boundaries a bit. i'm so glad i did. i don't think i have any other piece of clothing that makes me feel so classy or so fun, and certainly not at the same time. i wear it to work in an office environment with a cardigan, and the cardigan goes off after work as i run errands or play with the kids. i love it!!

"Lightweight, airy silk. it's not shown in the photos but it has a half slip which is too noticeable through the thin silk. it looks somewhat cheap. the silk doesn't feel smooth to the touch. it has a slight roughness to it. it would have been nicer if they had used thicker, higher quality silk. the waist has a tight, wide, elastic band which after wearing for awhile feels uncomfortable. the color of the skirt is true to the photos. i wanted to love this skirt but i will be returning it.",0

"I purchased this in both the black and the turquoise and wish they made more colors! this top is perfect for our florida 90 degree weather! i am usually a medium in tops (size 6-8), broad shoulders, size 36c and i purchased this in a 6p and a 6 (as they were out of petite in turquoise). i do prefer the 6p as i am 5'2"". i would say this runs generous as there is ample room to move. i wear mine with a nude bra on the turquoise top and the bra straps show a bit, but they are almost covered by the s",1
"This dress is gorgeous and has beautiful lines. it is a little on the big side, but the fabric drapes enough that it doesn't matter.",1
"This is a beautiful summer dress. i especially love the exposed back which is the perfect cut to not show your bra and feels professional enough for work. plus it's comfortable, drapes nicely, and is machine wash and dry.",1
"I ordered the mango and the navy in size 28. i am 5' and 130 lbs. both arrived with the size 28 label on them, the mango fit perfectly. perfect length on the legs and very flattering. the navy, on the other hand, was an inch shorter and an inch narrower! i kept double-checking the packing slip and the label inside the shorts to see if they accidentally sent a 27p. but no, it was clearly a 28. i brought that back to the store and ordered another navy 28, hoping that pair was just mislabeled 28 or",1
"This is a perfectly lovely jersey dress. it's really comfortable, true to size and the cut is flattering. you can wear it to work with heels or to the playground with your kids in sneakers or sandals. i didn't want to take it off. sizing is straightforward on this one: just order your regular size. there's nothing tricky about sizing. the xxsp (my regular size, depicted here), was just above the knee and not quite as long as the product description. great buy. waiting for boston weather to coope",1
"I've had this dress for a while now and waited to write a review, glad i did. i originally ordered the mp, 5'5"" 130 lbs. while it looked nice - accentuated my waist it was a bit big in the chest area. it probably would have been ok but i am picky about fit. after debating for awhile i ordered the sp and it fits much better! when i pulled it out of the package i was worried it was too short but it's not. it hits right above my knee. in fact i compared both dresses and there is not much of a diffe",1
Super easy and cute. i received lots of compliments!,1
"I was a little skeptical to buy this dress at first because of the pattern. in all honestly, i am so happy that i did. it's so unique and truly a one of a kind design. when tried on the dress is very slimming.",1
"I absolutely love this dress. the color is beautiful, the fit is flattering and it is so comfy i didn't want to take it off until bedtime. it is an all around winner. if i could do one thing to make it absolutely perfect i would take and inch or two off the hem. i am think of doing that but seriously i am not sure i want to have it out in alterations when i could be wearing it, it is just too comfy and cute!",1
"These do run small for pilcro which i think runs large overall. after reading other reviews i decided to get the size i would order in ag or coh and the like. thanks fellow reviewers because i'm pleased. when i first put them on i said no. the waist was a tad big (but comfy# and the legs seemed tight. with the slits at the bottom going right to my ankle (29 inch inseam) i thought these looked ridiculous. however, once i had them on for about 10 minutes they just sort of molded to my body and loo",1
"Beautiful dress!! i love this and am tempted to buy it in more colors. fits true to size, in a flattering way. love the cut of the back and the flow of the bottom.",1
"Was very surprised when i opened the package, this dress is very thin fabric and you need to wear a half slip as it is see through. the top of the dress is short to the draw string and does not drape bloused style at all. i have a short waist length so it should have worked. the color is a little darker than pictured, but over all looks cheap so full price with tax makes it way over priced. going back asap.",0
Beautiful dress; i ended up getting it in both the red and the green. the fit is absolutely perfect and it flatters pretty much any figure. one thing i would say is that you should get your exact size if possible; i ordered it online because it was so pretty in the 4p. i happened to be in the store the next week and i ttried on the 4r in the store just to see how it looked and it was awful! i was so disappointed but then my dress arrived in the mail and the 4p fit me perfectly. i'm so glad retailer,1
"This top is so cute. a little cropped, light for a sweater tank in my opinion, and runs a little big so i sized down one size. beautiful fabric and fit, the ruffles are such a fun addition! definitely recommend with a high waisted pant or skirt for work - so cute!",1
"I waited and got this sweater at the winter sale. i ordered the navy in a medium. the design is pretty, but as has been said, i was surprised at how short it is. i do love the detail, the tie back. nice weight. i have not found it to be itchy. the sweater i received was a store return, and it was a little wrinkled and fuzzy, but for $35 i considered my hunt for the perfect navy pullover to be over. i do need to wear a cami underneath, as the sides are more revealing than pictures. the first day",0
"I ordered both colors in xxs (xs p and xxs p were both sold out at the time sale came on): verdict, fits really nicely, but short. i would have to wear this with higher rise pants or pencil skirt (like the red one is pictures with a polka dot skirt). i decided to keep the red one, because it is a bot more unique, i do have a few navy tops. the xxs fits ""fitted"" (can't think of another way of saying it), so i like it as it will go nicely with looser bottoms. i love the sleeves, the ruffles make t",1
Love the overall design especially the tie on the back. i know it will become a favorite. i do wish it were a tad longer though.,1
"This is a thick sweater. it is pretty, but has a short length.",0
"Cute details but not happy with the fit. runs wide and short. the peplum fabric on bottom is stiff, wrinkles easily, and lays funny. returning this one.",0
"The fit is incredible! the print is very subtle, but makes them a little bit edgy and easy to pair with many things i already have in my closet.",1
"I really didn't expect this sweater to be so short. i'm 5'8"" and there is no way it would fit me properly. i honestly didn't even try it on. i pulled it out of the bag and put it right back in and returned it. it looks like a crop top. i bought the blue, which was not as rich and nice looking in person as the picture. i love most things i buy through retailer but this was a swing and a miss.",0
"Very lovely sweater - lightweight with cute detailing at the side of the waist, sweet but not saccharine bow at the back of the neck. i really wanted to love this sweater, but it had to go back because it looked, um, used. pilling along the arms before i even got to wear it? it got returned, sadly.",0
"I ordered this shirt through the website hoping it would look like it did on the model, it does! very nice, thick fabric. fits true to size, no complaints at all.",1
"Wasn't sure about sizing so i ordered the xl and they fit my 5'3"", 153 lb frame. they'd work for any height because they gathered quite a bit around my ankles but easily adjusted to look like they fit. amazingly, they don't show the squishy bits at all. it's a substantial thick knit. i'm returning because i don't have the body for these and i'm short waisted so the top, wide, slenderizing part of the waistband starts well above the area where i carry my weight in my tummy, mid section. i highly",1
"This is cut very strangely, i'm short waisted and this barely covered my belly button. the material is rough and scratchy. did not like at all and will be returning.",0
"Super comfortable while also being very flattering. i'm 5'7, 135 lbs and ordered a size small which fits perfectly. i get lots of complements on the color, which is as pictured. love these for yoga, climbing, and lounging.",1
Love this top! very flattering and fits true to size! top hits below mid thigh.,1
"I purchased this sweater because of the cute unique diagonal design. however, i was largely disappointed by the fiber of the sweater, it is rather coarse to the touch and a bad fit. on the model it looks nice, but it was large around the torso, yet short at the same time creating an awkward and unflattering fit. i shall be returning it.",0
"This top is gorgeous!!! the picture just does not do it justice. i bought it solely based on the one review that said it looks very good. and it does! the velvet work at the top makes it look very dressy. the sleeves are not with big holes that show too much, the top and sleeves are perfect. i really like this top. i can't believe that the photo doesn't show it's gorgeousness, it looks so much better in-person. i so wish it came in more colors!!",1
"I saw this sweater online and have been looking for a unique sleevless sweater for some time now. its a very beautiful sweater so i ordered it right away when i saw this design. i recieved the sweater in the mail and really wanted to love it but it just wasn't for me. its very well made and thick which i liked but i usually fit in small sized tops for retailer but they didn't have a small left in the sizes, i ordered a medium and it still ran small, i was very surprised. its was also disappointing",0
"Chambray top that is soft, but thick/heavy so it drapes well and is very flattering on. untucked, the top is shorter in the front and longer in the back. it hangs like a tunic, almost a-line so do not size up or you will have too much material. i am a sz small in most retailer clothing, and the sz 2 fit nicely. sz 4 was too loose around my arms, and the sz 0 was too tight around my chest. nice neckline and a pop of surprise with the gorgeous lace detail in the back.",1
"This looks cute in the web photo, unfortunately it is absolutely huge in person. i got the small and have to return it because it is not wearable for me.",0
"The black band seemed to cut across the widest part of my hips, emphasizing them. the pants are sheer. the fabric was not comfortable against my skin. overall, the pants were a miss.",0
I bought the xs in green and every time i wear it i get compliments all day. it's a more youthful style than i usually wear but i couldn't resist the dark green color. i wear this with black leggings and flats and it's a perfect dress for a school day.,1
"I love pilcros and tried everything to get these to work. one size down, two sizes down, no matter what, they just don't look right. the droopy look didn't work for me.",0
"I love my very old pilcro stet jeans. they are the perfect denim weight, and the back pockets are set in a way that is very flattering for the tush. not so with the newer pilcros unfortunately. the denim is thinner and may have more stretch and they get worn and pill on my inner thighs. and the back pockets are set far apart making my back side look unnaturally wide. it's a bummer.",0
"Although i find $150 a little pricey for a sleeveless sweater, buy it. i bought a size medium which fits me exactly. it is an off-white, which is what i wanted. i will be wearing it with a sweater skirt, for the ""sweater dress"" look. it is comfortable and versatile-also with a jacket.",1
"I'm 5'2 and 105 lbs; normally a size 25 petite for most jean brands but learned after receiving my online purchase that these jeans run large. i exchanged them for a size 24 petite and thought they fit okay at first but after testing them around the house, they kept stretching and i felt like they were going to fall off my waist! didn't want to wear a belt with these because it distracted from the relaxed style. sadly had to return my purchase.",1
This jacket is beautiful! the embroidery is very well done! the jacket is fully lined in black. i usually wear a l/xl and definitely needed the xl as it runs a little small.,1
Just got these and they are great..i ordered mine online and took the advice of many reviewers to size down. i usually wear a 27 (sometimes a 26) but got these in a 26 and they are perfect. the material is soft and stretchy. would highly recommend these to all.,1
"This shirt is so great! i fell in love with it once i saw the back. if you're looking for a classic looking shirt with a little pizzazz, this is it. i have wide hips, and this tank if great because it's a little boxy without making me look huge. it's excellent quality, and i look forward to wearing this tank all spring and summer!",1
"These were very nice, but had to return. i have a hard time with jeans as i am big and curvy in hips and butt. these were tight in those places and big in the waist,",1
"For reference i am 5'5"" and 145lbs with an hourglass figure and bought a 8 petite instead of my usual 6 because i wanted it to be a bit shorter with the a-line design. the skirt fit perfectly, but the waistband is not stretchy like the rest of the skirt. the quality is great but the design and color is not. the skirt is actually much darker of a red than in the picture, more like a dark red wine. it is super a-line which was not flattering on me and the layers are all individual pieces of fabric",0
"Love the crochet detail on the back. yes, it does show the bottom band of your bra. i think i'm okay with that. i had on a magenta colored bra when i tried this on and it was a nice pop of color. i think the top runs tts to slightly big. if you're in between sizes i would go down. i am a 34b and i ordered a size 4. so i haven't tried on the 2 but i think it would fit too and not be quite as loose in the arm hole area. i'm sure this top will sell out before it hits sale.",1
"This top is gorgeous, but the sleeves are all wrong. they're very tight for about 5"" at the bottom, right up to the elbow making it tight when i bend my arms. it's also loose in the armpit area, the bottom of the sleeve starts under my chest, and is styled that way, so i'm considering returning. i actually drove an hour to the nearest store to size up, but the sleeve feels even more tight. ugh! i love the quality & looks otherwise, and the front is double layered so no need to layer. the front i",1
These jeans were so cute on- wore them a handful of times and they'd been washed twice. put them on and - rip! ripped right at the crotch in the front so not fixable- and on vacation no less when i had to scramble to find something else to wear. poor quality - disappointing and not what i expected from retailer. :-( they also run large even for a more relaxed fit- sized down for a good fit.,0
"I think you have to have stick legs/legs for days for this style to fit as pictured. i thought i had found the perfect boyfriend jean, but once these babies arrived i was really disappointed. the color is slightly brighter than the picture, which is fine, though i was digging the slightly greyed look.

anyway, these were loose in the waist and crotch and fit snugly everywhere else. i have a fairly athletic build, so it's not uncommon for me to have issues with fit around the calves and thighs,",0
"Love these funky jeans. they are a little baggy, like boyfriend jeans. i wore them with a linen white tee and wore them dressed up with a silk top and boots for ""casual"" friday. they are versatile. love these jeans!",1
Love this so much! i have received so manu compliments!,1
"This is a sweet, lightweight top that i will wear again and again. nice touches in the front and back. little keyhole opening with two buttons at the neck in back.",1
"Ordered this top online, as i loved the colors and design, but i should have listened to the other reviewers. i ordered my usual size m, and it was just very unflattering. it was short and wide, not at all like it's pictured on the model. needless to say it was immediately shipped back.",0
I ordered my usual medium. the tops length came only to my waist  and was wide and unflatering.   the armholes were right under my arms. too bad as this looked so cute in the picture. i returned.,0
"This outfit was online for months with no review so i was skeptical to order but very glad i did as it is better in person. 
it is beautiful, high quality tommy bahama inspired suit. i am 55 so short shorts are risky even though i am a typical size 4 or 6. i took a 4 in the blazer and i am typically a high 4 or low 6 in size so i would say the blazer is very true to size. i took the size 8 in the shorts as i felt they ran small and i wanted the extra length. they ride a bit lower on my waist an",1

"Boxy, unflattering, and large.

i'm 5'2'' and a curvy 135 pounds. this top (size s) swallowed me, had no shape, and the material didn't feel great either. i wouldn't even purchase it on sale--there are other graphic tees that are much nicer. i'll be sticking to splendid and sundry.",0
"I liked it online, but i didn't want to pay shipping for something i wasn't sure if it is good. when i saw one size 4 in the store, i was excited to try it on. however, it didn't quite meet the expectation. the dress fits a little loose (donna morgan size 2 fits me better), and it is not lined at all. the separate top piece is just way too big without any shape. there must be a clip on the back of the top shown on the model to make it look smaller. i love the blue floral print, but that is the o",0
"Runs true to size but some details were not as expected. the slit is only on one side and the look is more like sweater dress than sweater tunic. the length is not as long as pictured on the model. i'm 5'7 and the sweater ends half an inch below knees.
the side slit starts too high, my waist is exposed unless i wear high waisted leggings.
other than that the sweater is darling. the cotton (68%) and acrylic (32%) thread is soft and thin, not bulky at all. the sweater stretches lightly with wear a",1
"With all of the glowing reviews of this dress, i so badly wanted to adore this very special cocktail dress. it fit nicely, the quality was great, but there is a decorative (?) line of hook and eyes down the front which come undone with the slightest movement. i wore the dress out one time and was paranoid the entire time, kept glancing down to make sure i hadn't come undressed. i suppose i could've gotten out the needlenose and crimped them all shut, but decided to take it back. i didn't see tha",0
"I love this sweater because it is an edge to it, fit is true to size and its soft and confortable",1
"Gorgeous pattern, even prettier in person! runs slightly large in my opinion, could size down. nice to have as a petite option.",1
Great sweater. cozy and thick. the bands at the waist and wrists help keep this sweater in place. the loopy knitted fabric adds a bit of texture to the gray which makes it a little more exciting than your average gray sweater. i got a small and it fit perfectly.,1
"I have this in the blue/teal color, and i love it, so far! i'm considering buying it in other colors. this tee is stretchy, comfortable, and soft, even after being washed a few times. it fit true to size on me (xs), although it's a bit form-hugging, so if you want a looser fit, consider sizing up. the only thing about the blue is that it's not quite as dark as in the photo on the website. i wish retailer would make these kinds of basic tees more often!",1
"I love this dress because it's so comfortable and has this hippie peasant vibe that i don't generally wear. plus it's a three season dress with pockets! bought the medium but i should have sized down to a small. on top i'm a m/l girl and the medium is huge. i'm not going to exchange since i wear a sweater over it right now. this dress looks good with or without a belt, with long boots, booties and sandals. so happy with this purchase!",1
"When i ordered this online, i should have paid more attention to the picture. the dress comes to the knees of the 5'10"" model. i was swimming in small petite size. i checked the label and wondered whether i received the wrong size. nope, it was ps. either the dress was mislabeled, or this is cut huge. returning. too bad because the shape and color are cute.",0
"I built a new wardrobe around the three lovely velvet blazers: moss, copper and burgundy. they are soft, well-fitting, pretty linings and very satisfactory. this new version is stiff material, and ill-fitting. not coming in petite is a problem and it may fit others better, but it is too full across the front. with the stiff materials, this is a bad fit. disappointing and going back.",0
"I tried this on in the store in the xs size. the pattern is striking and really makes you think of all the things you love about fall. having said that i did not buy it and probably won't unless i find it on the sale rack later. it is really more of a poncho than a sweater. the fit is very oversize through the body and i tried the xs size. it is also fairly cropped on me as i am tall. i would only wear it with a shirt underneath. the sleeves and not attached to the shoulder, but start further do",1
This top is very cute and if you are short you will love it. i am tall and the dividing line of color block kept rising up over my bust so it looked weird. it made it look like an ill fitting maternity top. had to go back.,0
"This dress runs a bit small. the large arm holes were unflattering to my small chest. also, this dress seemed to make my belly protrude. it kind of made me look pregnant in a way that no other dress has! i could see this dress being flattering on someone with a very flat stomach or a large chest. not me!!",0
"The dress was just too ill fitting and bulky and large. it was more matronly looking then anything and did not fit well. if you are going to try it, probably size down 2 sizes. for reference, i'm 5'4"" and 124 lbs. i bought my normal size 4 and it was very large. i would not recommend as it's just not flattering. i love one shoulder dresses and tops so was very disappointed as i'm an retailer devotee....",0
"I really like this top, the material is thicker than i thought which is a good thing! it fits me very well and is very comfortable. i definitely recommend this shirt!",1
"This dress is quite lovely in person, but it runs very small, particularly in the bust. i'm usually okay with a large in retailer dresses (sometimes medium), but i had a hard time getting into this, and the top was literally about 10"" from being able to zip up. granted, i have a larger than average bust, but that's still excessive, and the fabric has no give whatsoever.
the online pictures are pretty accurate representations in terms of look and shape. i think it would probably be best for pear s",1

"This looks so gorgeous on the model on the site, so i ordered it online. it was incredibly frumpy when i tried it on. looks like i took a floor rug, cut a hole in the middle and slipped it over my head. the sweater itself is so pretty, its just too bad it falls so awkwardly on me. i normally wear a small so i ordered the xs/s and the sleeves still fall past my thumbs. its kind of itchy too. will be returning this asap.",0
"I am waist-challenged. i like a narrowly cut structured sheath dress, sort of like the 60s styles. this is a great dress either belted or loose with great accessories and lovely shoes. it has so many colors in the pattern, you can wear this with anything, and the fabric is so high-end and quality that you can definitely wear this to work with a jacket and then change into a denim or leather jacket and tough high boots and go out for the evening in the fall-winter. it arrived in the mail and righ",1

"The retailer stylist had showed me this on my way out of the fitting room and i'm so glad she did. i went back in to try it on and loved it!! it almost has a ""spanx"" like stretch to the material which perfectly keeps its shape and is so well made. i also really liked the open part in the back because it adds an extra something to the dress but you can still wear a strapless bra if you desire. i plan on wearing it at the beach on the 4th of july:-)",1
"I love this dress. the fabric is a little heavy, so it won't blow away on a windy day (and bonus, even with my triple d chest i'm comfortable not wearing a bra with this) but may not be what you want to wear on a really hot day. the shape is flattering on any body type-i am 6 months pregnant and it still looks great. it can go from spring to summer to fall quite easily, with the addition of a jean jacket and some converse or vans instead of sandals. i'd absolutely recommend this dress.",1
"I had such high hopes, but they are just slightly off. they run a tad large, so i suggest sizing down. (i usually wear a 28 or 29, and the 28 fit nicely through the hips and thighs.)
unfortunately, the color is off- i thought they were going to be a dark midnight blue, but they are actually gray. and they have a button-fly closure which causes the pants to protrude a bit in the area where no woman wants protrusion. i will be returning them.",0
"I bought a 2p when i should've bought a 0p. i was swimming in the 2p. however, it didn't matter, because everything was itchy, and i'm not even allergic to wool. the beautiful buttons are oddly placed to achieve that cool design, and just like other reviewers commented, you have to twist and contort them to get them to button...which, inevitably, will lead to them popping off. and i didn't see an extra one in case that happened. the coat is stunning, there's no argument about that, and i welcome",0
"I ordered this coat because, like others, i was taken by its feminine beauty! unfortunately, the coat showed up with the top button broken off (and missing) and another button hole torn open. i returned that coat right away, thinking that it'd been damaged somehow in shipping. however, i began to question the quality of the coat when the second coat showed up with a broken and missing top button! when i tried on the coat, i found the missing button stuffed into the pocket. not the quality i expe",0
I am 5'9 and i wear my usual 27 like i always do in pilcro. i am so sad that they are too short. they are 32.5 inches long and it's just too short for my legs even with flats. the fit is great and they run true to size but they are too short for tall girls. i usually buy the wide leg linen pants and those are long enough. these needed to be about an inch longer. i do recommend them if you're a bit shorter :),1
Cute and comfy! i usually wear a small but bought a medium because it appeared to run a little small.,1
"This dress isn't as fitted as it looks on the model. it appear to be more of a shift dress. as gorgeous as the print and quality are, it doesn't look great on me. for reference, i'm 5'5 105lbs and bought xs. for whatever reason, the high neckline isn't flattering on me. i do personally think this dress is perfect if you have broad shoulders.",0
"Love the coat. style and fit are a perfect fit. true to size.
thanks for the previous reviews about the button. i am extra careful taking it on and off. versatile. take the collar off and wear on a sweater or whatever inspires you.",1
"This coat is so lovely, it is the embodiment of 1940's classic movie star style. the color, the style, the collar add a subtle flair of drama that you definitely want in your wardrobe .... if only it weren't for those pesky buttons!
like other reviewers, i am disappointed to note that within a month of owning, the top button popped off in the middle of a dinner date on a rainy night in a french restaurant. that same night, i noticed a button was missing from one of the sleeves. alas, i am as yet",0
I just tried these on at my local seattle store and ended buying a size up. i feel they ran small as i am usually a 29 in most and got the 31 in these. the 30 fit tight but it looked nothing special just like a very high rise mom jean and i was bursting the top button so this jean is made for hourglass bodies for sure. the 31 is loose and slouchy and it looked really different in a good way so it came home with me. they are a washed out black grey color with some tie die effects. did not care fo,1
"It was a hard decision, but i'm returning these. they're definitely pretty and well-made. they drape nicely. ultimately, they are too high-waisted and too billowy for most of my tops (which are mostly long and billowy). these trousers are too nice to wear with most of my fitted tanks. even a normal-length t-shirt, untucked, draped weirdly and came down too far on these high-waisted pants. i guess they're too ""formal"" for what i had in mind - pictured them more like a maxi skirt. if they were hal",0

I was so excited to see this yellow dress online but was disappointed with the color when it arrived. the yellow us much darker than pictured. i felt the dress ran true to size but if you're short you definitely want to go with petite sizes.,0
"I love this dress so much that i bought it in 2 colors: one in blue and one in orange. great style, comfortable and quality material. however, the cut is much, much deeper than it appears in the pictures. women with bust should be conscious of that. 

the blue is the better color. the orange looks more like a fluorescent, red-orange. still cute, but not as subtly muted as it appears in the pics. 

overall, great dress. even better with the sale price.",1
"Love it - love the color, fabric and buttons. really comfortable! relaxed fit",1
This dress just fits weird. maybe it works for somebody..... there is a reason it has been put on sale...,0
"I got this dress in the navy blue and it fits perfect. there is a little too much fabric in the middle, but it allows the dress the stretch more. the fabric on the button is a little thin and not lined, but you really can't see anything through it. i'm 5'2"" and usually purchase the petite, but the regular fit just fine and hit me about mid knee. the petite would have probably been too short.",1
"I ordered the black and white version online, and the dress fit perfectly. it was very well-made with a nicely textured, heavier cloth, and the overall appearance is very classy. it is a versatile dress, and i would highly recommend it!",1
"It's a beautiful sweater but it is very wide (much wider than it looks on the model), even in the xs/s. it is also fairly itchy. just way too big for my small frame, which is not really the look i was going for.",0
"This is not even a dolman style sweater because it's loose fitting everywhere around the arm. the point of a dolman sweater is that the sleeves are fitted around the wrist/forearm, but this is not the case with this sweater. it's super loose around the wrist area - i can fit both of my wrists into a sleeve.",0
As soon as i saw this piece online i knew i had to have it. like other reviewers the black flower part on the shoulders can be itchy underneath. it does run large but that's my style. i love pairing pieces like this with skinny jeans or leggings and booties. can be dressed up or down. highly recommend :),1
"This sweater is gorgeous. it is soft and i love the button detail down the sides of the sleeves. i would have loved the blue color but it was sold out, so i settled for the soft peach color. it is a very pretty sweater and looks nice on.",1
"I love both the color of this sweater as well as the buttons on the cuffs. this sweater is an easy pick any day of the week and goes well with all of my work pants. plus, the soft and pretty pink adds some brightness to my otherwise dark winter wardrobe.",1
This top is lovely! high quality yet delicate material and is the perfect weight to transition to autumn. the top is oversized yet flattering. paired with leggings it will be the perfect travel outfit for my upcoming trip. i can't wait to wear it over and over again!,1
"I ordered this a few weeks ago on major sale. im quite tall (5'11) so i went with the m/l to ensure that the length would work. its definitely long enough, almost a little too big, but i like the slouchy look. my only real complaint is that its a bit itchy. other than that i think its a great buy!",1
"I ordered the red/orange but it was much brighter than i expected (felt almost neon). and the dress felt much more casual than i expected from the pictures online. that said, it's a great dress and i am keeping it - just adjusting my expectations/what i plan to wear it for.",1
"I was so excited to try this sweater on when it arrived but to my disappointment, it was overly large! i was pratically swimming in it. really love the design and the way it looks on the model. just didn't work out that way on me.",0
"Love this poncho! it's casual, has a bit of a sexy vibe, comfy. great with leggings, probably boots once it's a little cooler. soft and lacey, lace is sheer so a cami is needed.",1
"This sweater has the weirdest stitching, although the buttons on the sleeves are a nice touch and the hunter green color is to die...poor fit means poor sweater :)",0
"I bought this in the orange color. might not be the color for everyone but with my coloring looked great, very similar to the picture online. fit is perfect, very comfortable. the fabric is night, stretching but flattering. bought this with the 30% off sale, not sure i would have paid full price based on the fabric. but love that i got if for extra off the sale. wish the others were in stock because i would have bought them too.",1
I bought this dress thinking it would be cute for christmas in florida but when i received it i wasn't so sure about a christmas dress. i like it for a casual night out with high boots. super cute!! i received many compliments!,1
"I was so excited to order this sweater. i thought that the moss color would make it a great basic for work or casual days. ordering it on sale made it all the better. however, when it came i was so sad to see how muted the colors were, with little definition. the sweater itself lacks definition as well, just shapeless and hangy. i also did not expect the angora like hair on the sweater which bothered by eyes as soon as i tried it on.",0
"This sweater is big and box. it looks very similar on as it does on the model. as other reviewers have mentioned, the embroidery on the shoulders is a bit itchy.",0
"Although this has a nice design and i wanted to love it, it already looked ruined in the store with pulls all over each one i found. the fit is nice but i wouldn't buy it due to the material being too delicate.",0
"Just purchased this in the lilac color in the store in my usual xs size. the cut and shape are very flattering, with the waist sitting lower than my natural waist. in person, the color looks very different than on the website. it is more a lovely neutral taupe to me. one thing is that the snap at the neck is placed about one half inch off in order for the neckline to lay flat. since this jumpsuit is so cute, i decided that this is an easy fix i can do myself.",1
"I really like this sweater a lot. it runs huge though. i have a m/l and i'm swimming in it (5'9"" sz 12-14). i like the length and the swingy-ness. there's enough coverage for me to feel comfortable layering it over a bra cami and leggings. the shoulder detail is what makes it. the only downside is that the threads on the reverse side of the embroidery are a little rough, but not enough to bother me. the knitted fabric is soft and cool feeling. i plan on wearing it into fall with ""real pants"" and",1
This dress has a great shape and fabric - but the v neckline is too deep/low and the arm holes are also cut too low. would loved to have been able to keep it but had to return.,0
"This is a really nice quality dress. it is a low-cut v-neck but the fabric is form fitting so its not revealing when u move. i love the top part of the dress but the skirt just did nothing for me. it's a soft material but the skirt almost resembles a bath towel in look and feel. i am petite in size (5'0"" 100lbs). i will be returning due to the skirt being to loose on me in width rather than length. also, the center pleat of the skirt makes it look a bit odd. the skirt hit right at knee height.",0
"This sweater is comfy and light and the buttons are a great added detail. i bought this as a gift, but i tried it on anyways and almost kept it for myself! great for early spring days.",1
Tried this little number on in store...... i am 51 years old..... not a bad body.... gave this a shot. it looks minus my slightly wrinkled knees great ....and very close to what it looks like on model. very happy with one!!!,1
"I have been wanting this skirt for a long time. i was worried about waist which is fitted. i finally ordered it and it i very cute. the waist is indeed fitted but there is some give to the fabric, fabric is soft cotton not unlike denim with some stretch. there i a soft cotton liner in skirt. i took the cloth belt off because i cannot retie it so neatly as in the photo, also i just don't want a bow on my stomach. i own a cute narrow belt that i will wear with skirt as i think something is needed",1
"This is the widest sweater i have ever seen. i laughed out loud when i opened it, and then showed it around my office and everyone else cracked up too. it is comically wide. 

even when i was 9-1/2 months pregnant, the m/l would have been pretty roomy on me. now that i'm back to about a size 10-12, this looks like jared from subway's pre-weight-loss pants, in sweater form. ridiculous!",0
"I didn't go with the intention of even looking at a dress, but decided to try this on. once i did, i knew that i had to get it. it's so cute. i got the one listed as green motif, which is actually a royal blue bodice. the colors are vibrant and it's so comfortable.",1
"This is a great sweater. i gave it four instead of five stars because it runs unusually wide and is a bit boxy. if you like your clothes a little big, this is the sweater for you!",1
Pretty! can't wait to wear this in the fall. design is understated yet pretty. nice poncho:swing style. haven't worn it yet so i can't rate the durability or wash experience yet. glad i got this on sale!,1
"The sweater could be really pretty, but it is huge. i ordered the xs/s and it was swimming on me. it's too bad, because the stitching was beautiful, but this item is going back.",0
"I grabbed my typical size (8) and found it fit snug in the bust. the fabric has plenty of stretch, so the snugness was fine, especially because it meant there was no gaping along the neckline in the front. it's lowcut, but i didn't feel particularly exposed. i ended up not buying it because i don't think it fit my body right. the distance between the top of the shoulder and the bottom of the arm hole was too long for me - a significant portion of my bra was exposed at the bottom of the arm hole",0
I was drawn to the green/blue color in store! it's so cute and comfortable. i'm usually a size 2/4 and needed the 2. the bodice is flattering and the length was perfect on me. i'm even 4 months pregnant with my 2nd baby and this will work with my growing belly for another month or so. it's got great stretch!,1
This top is very airly and swingy.  definitely need to wear skinny jeans to off set the volume on top.  it is a pretty top and also unique so i kept it.,1
"I love the concept of an airy, flowing sweater that has great detail. this item stole my heart online. however, i am fairly petite (5'3'') and it looked like it was drowning me. the neck line is decently wide and my small frame couldn't hold it up; it kept falling off my shoulders. i ended up returning. i think it would look and feel fantastic though if i were taller and had broad shoulders.",0
"I was not sure whether i would like an xs or a s. rompers can be tricky. i am 5'6"" 123lbs. i went ahead and ordered the xs and it is perfect. it is just long enough in the body for me. the shorts length is perfect, not too short or too long. i can't wait to wear this!",1
"Very comfortable, looks good on. like the fabric also.",1
"This dress is gorgeous in person. it is so much softer than it appears the photo and the fabric moves well. what you can't see from the picture is that the bodice sort of overhangs the skirt by an inch or so which is really nice for accentuating a small waist and separates the top from the bottom in a cool way. 

i am 5'6"" 135 lbs and curvy. 36-26-39 for reference. i ordered the 4 and it is loose although still flattering thanks to the forgiving cut. wish i had gotten a 2 but now they are sold",1
"This is a very pretty dress. the previous reviewers helped a lot when it came to deciding which size to order. typically i am a 0 or 2, sometimes a 4. in this dress i ordered a 6. that was the perfect size. 

the coloring is cute, unique, and very versatile. for me it wasn't a keeper because the material was soooo heavy, feels like canvas almost. if you're looking for a dress to layer under a chunky sweater on a cold day i imagine this would work. but for me it was a no.",0
"I love this dress. i bought it 2 weeks ago and have already worn it 3 times, each time receiving multiple compliments. it is easy, comfortable and cute. also love that you can tie it in the back or the front. great dress!",1
"I saw this dress in the catalog and immediately ran to the store to purchase. then i realized the dress in the catalog is slightly different, but the small differences is what makes the catalog dress so much more unique and worth the money! look at the top, the stripe colors are different. and the stripes flow different on the skirt part as well. and the dress was short on me and i'm two inches shorter than the model. bummer.",0
"I'll start with what i loved, this dress is made with a really beautiful, quality material. the material is gorgeous in person and the dress is lined which is really nice. however the fit is just so very strange. i am 5'6"" and curvy. i tried both a medium and a small (for reference i usually take a medium or large/ size 8 or 10) the medium was so large and too roomy around the arms and chest (i'm 34 d) the small was too tight. the v neck lay in a very strange way and i'm not sure it would have b",0
"This dress reminds me of a fabric used for curtains. it is sturdy beautiful and strong. i looked like a large picture window in it. if i was 5'10"" and 120 pounds it may have worked ?",0
This is a sweet top as it is shown. on the model it appears there is a panel behind the lace on the front of the top. this is not so-the entire front of the top is see through. one would need to wear a camisole. the material on the blouse is very sheer-it appears to be rather cheap actually. if you are wearing a top this sheer it does not make sense to have a camisole on underneath. that said you are going to be able to see your bra and skin down to your belly button if you do not have a camisol,0
"Nice quality fabric and design, but found the armhole cut weirdly and fit of upper bodice strange. wanted to love it but sadly sent it back",0
"This dress is super cute, flattering and well made but it runs very small. i am usually a 6 so from other reviews i ordered an 8 and it is still tight in the hip area. it zips but the fabric pulls a bit in the front and it rides up when i walk. i am going to try and exchange it for a 10 because i think i'll get lots of wear out of it.",1
I love the cut of this dress. i can see how some would not like the way the arms are cut. i love the pockets and the way this dress flows when you walk it it. it's very fun to wear. i am wearing it to an awards show and was a little worried it may be too casual but the texture and weight of the fabric make it look more dressy. i will be getting a lot of mileage out of this dress.,1
"This dress looks cute online, but it is enormous. i bought a small, but it looked more like a 3x plus size. i tried it on, just in case, and honestly it looked like a great dress for a clown. this dress must have had two feet of fabric pinned behind the model in the photo.",0
"Loved everything about this top except two things: the price (there is a lot of pretty detail though) and the shoulders. what is not depicted in the stock photos is how wide the shoulder ruffles are...i have an athletic build at 5'7"", 140 lbs and 32dd and this top unfortunately made me look like a football player. i ordered a small and the fit was perfect. beware that this top is on the shorter side. it really is very pretty but i would steer away if you have athletic or broad shoulders.",0
"I've been eyeing this dress for months, so when it went on sale i finally purchased it. now i see why it's on sale.
the dress runs extremely large and has no shape.... looks like a potatoe sack and i feel like moo...moo in it!
this will be going back to the store!!!!",0
"The dress is pretty and like retailer it is nice quality, i just didn't keep it because it had no shape on me and even with a belt didn't look right. i would have gone down a size in this dress also.",0
"I have been eyeing this dress online for a while but never could justify the price. well, when it went on sale, i couldn't pass up the opportunity. it arrived today and is even better than i expected. very flattering cut, long enough for tall people (i'm 5'10"") and beautiful colors. 

i ordered s (my usual size in retailer dresses, i'm 145 lbs, 36c) and it fits perfectly. this will definitely be my go-to dress for the rest of the summer. i love all my retailer dresses but sometimes find them a tad",1
"I had high hopes for this top based on the photos, but when it arrived it is a very thin cheap feeling top. the color is a dusty rose color that has a yellowish mottle throughout it, almost like a tie dye or slub effect.  not pretty at all.",0
Love this top!  it is fitted through the shoulders and arms and has a slight swing.  the peplum falls at a great spot and the material lays nicely.  very flattering on my 5 months postpartum body that is on the rebound.  i got the blue but i might get the pink too!,1
Loved the design and legnth but the material was not a light and soft as i expected.  i would get this in another fabric.,0
"When i saw this top online, i thought i'd love it and immediately ordered it in both colors.  they arrived today and i am soooo disappointed.  i have never seen such drab colors.  the blue is a muddy grayish hue (like an overcast day) and the pink is a dusty shade of peach.  yuck.  and i was hoping the ruffle at the bottom would have a chiffon-like flowy effect.  instead, the ruffle is made of a cheap looking knit.  back these go...",0
"I really wanted to like this dress. i am 5'3"" 125 lbs and this dress was about 4 inches too long. the hem created a puddle around my feet. i've bought other maxis from retailer without this problem. sadly it went back to the store.",0
"The title says it all. while the quality was good, when i put this dress on a felt like i was wearing a shapeless sack fashioned out of wallpaper. the length was longer than on the model (makes sense since i am only 5'5""), which was ok, but the overall fit was just too big. i am a size 2 and tried the xs, which was huge. just not flattering or breezy or sexy in any way. going back!",0
"Man, this dress is the worst. i don't understand how it looks the way it does on the model. agree with previous reviewer - there must be a minimum of 200 pins pulling the waves and waves of extra fabric back. this dress looks so cute , but is so, so, so disappointing in person. sweater collar and cuffs - stiff and bulky. dress - billowy and sack-like - not sure how they got a belt to pull it all in. save yourself the return and do not get sucked in by the sale price and extra sale discount like",0
I was so ready to love this dress but it runs extremely small - like you should maybe purchase a size 2 sizes bigger than what you normally wear.,0
"I just received my back-ordered wildberry top in blue. it's not blue but instead a dull, mottled purplish hue. it looks like a well-worn, stretched out tee shirt with a tired ruffle along the bottom. so disappointing. it's going back for sure.",0
I was under the impression that the blouse is lined however i'd need to buy yet another tank to go underneath which may be an issue due to how short this blouse is. i returned it.,0
The material is wonderful and the dress is lined. plenty of room in the bodice area for a 36d bust. will be wearing a lot this season.,1
"I love this dress, the print is beautiful, the fabric has a nice heavy drape and the cut is simple but unique. i'm short and curvy so generally shapeless dresses don't work on me, this is an exception.

i ordered the regular instead of the petite and it is full length on me, which i think i like more than if it were a midi.

the armholes do cut in, i wasn't sure if i liked that until i sized down and it fit closer.

my husband chuckled that it's a little mrs. roper... i don't care, i'm wea",1
"Easy, fun and flattering. fits tts. i normally wear a m/l or 10/12. i ordered a large and it fits well. the tie at the back lets you wear it as tight or loose as you want it. the length is good for my 5'9 frame.",1
I wasn't expecting to love to this dress as much as i do.  the length and horizontal stripes (petite was sold out and my torso is square) are automatically two strikes but the sale-on-sale price was begging me to give it a go.  so glad i did!  the cut and flare are flattering.  the self to tie is slimming and can be styled different ways.  the regular length is doable when i wear platform wedges.  the colors scream summer and vacation fun.  my only problem is the feel of the fabric--liner is fin,1
This is a gorgeous dress. the fabric has the look of linen (though it is not) and the lining is a soft mesh. looks both relaxed and stylish.,1
"This top is just darling!  the body of the top is lightweight ""sweatshirt"" type material that's dyed to appear well used.  the ruffling along the bottom is color coordinated and beautifully textured.  great to wear with leggings!  the back hangs lower than the front so your rear will be covered.  extremely comfortable, machine washable.  an unexpectedly ""nicer than it looks online"" garment.  i bought the blue version which looks more lavender irl.",1
"It is one of the best dress for the season. light, nice color, elegant, can not find more word of it. really great buy! this brand has very special design that really amazed me recently. just want to give a+ to the designer.",1
"The cowl and cuffs of the dress are thick and heavy sweater material, but the dress itself is extremely thin. the non-belted pictures do not show how much volume there is to the dress, which was enormous in my normal size.",0
"This is an amazing summer dress! so pretty it stood out even though only a few were left on the rack. it's light, airy and perfect even for the hottest summer days. the straps are not adjustable but for me the dress was not too low and it fit just like on the model pictured. a very thin belt comes with it but adds nothing ,only detracts. i am usually a s or m in retailer sizing and the s was perfect. 
 ( for ref. 5'7', 140 lbs) this dress is so flawless and beautiful and i feel wonderful wearing",1
This dress has way too much material. the material is really soft and beautiful but there's too much of it. it feels like you're wearing a big sack. sadly i'll be returning it.,0
"I am a petite girl, 5'2""/105 lbs- i bought size s and it fits me just right. i love the way the fabric feels on my body. i tried this dress with flat shoe and it doesn't make me look short. the colors are vibrant but not too bright which makes it perfect for any time of the year to wear.",1
"Unlike the other two reviews , i found this dress horrid. i ordered a xs since i am between that and a s. it was just too much fabric for me. . i have a small frame, so it was just so overwhelming, the armholes were big and i felt like i had a bag on me. colors were nice and fabric was soft and light.. the belt made no sense as others have said. length was good. i tried it on as soon as i got it and couldn't take it off fast enough. i literally ran to the post office and back it goes. this is my",0
"Too full of a dress for me. i tried a belt and it is then too chunky. if you are younger, tall and slim, this would look great",0
When i received the dress i went to try it on and one of the loops for the string to cinch the dress broke. guess that's gonna have to go back,1
"Love this dress! the other reviews were accurate. it is a lot of fabric and i can't decide whether i will actually use the belt that it came with. but i think it would be a great, beachy dress for the summer.",1
"... between looking fat and looking like you have a human being on tap (which is way longer than you would imagine). another reviewer mentioned that this makes your boobs look huge when cinched which is true, and also ok since my boobs are huge now. if i wasn't pregnant i'm not sure i would go with this because it definitely has a lot more fabric to it than the model photos make it appear, especially when you cinch. but for 6 months pregnant, this dress made me feel fab.u.lous since it toned dow",1
"I tried these on in the store and they are super cozy. at 5'1"", they hit me just above the ankle in the regular length. i came to the website to get the petite length, hoping for a better fit in the rise as well as a slightly shorter leg length. these pants are comfortable without looking sloppy.",1
The pattern and fabric on this dress are very nice. there is just too much fabric. it's much too baggy but could make a nice maternity dress. i'll be returning it.,0
"I have a love-hate relationship with this dress. the fabric and print are beautiful but like most swing styles, this dress doesn't work if you're curvy. tried on an xs in the store which was huge, ordered an xxsp, the length was perfect but the dress does nothing for a pear-shape. looks marginally better cinched in with the belt but i was lost in all the fabric and the skimming nature of the dress did nothing for me. as my boyfriend said, ""that looks like something you'd wear if you were pregnan",1
I was so excited to get this dress. i saw someone try it on in the store and waited all season for it to go on sale. i loved it except for the seam that was right at the neckline in the front. they didn't even try to match up the fabrics. it was so obvious and cheap looking that i had to send this dress back. so sad!,0
"As soon as i saw this dress i ordered it...i didn't want to miss out on it. i loved the look...the colors were so fun and bright...i thought it was going to be my perfect dress for an upcoming trip to hawaii. i am 5'4"" about 118#. i ordered a pxs. when it arrived i loved the feel of the fabric and the colors but was wondering what it would look like on as it was a lot of fabric. i know it is to be flowing but on me it was just awful. part is that the ties on the shoulder are sewn in place so i c",0
"Got the petite size. dress is swing style, so extra fabric is expected. can wear a nude bra or strapless. dress is beautiful in person, more so than online. very comfy and stands out without being flashy, just pretty and different. nice silk (matte, not shiny).",1
"This dress is soft, comfortable, beautiful and drapes so nicely - not tent-like at all. i wasn't sure about sizing, and went with some reviewers who recommended sizing down, but the small in the strap/underarm area so i am exchanging for my usual medium. as another reviewer noted, you cannot adjust the straps, they are stitched together not tied together. i considered having it altered but was assured there are plenty in stock. i cannot wait for it to arrive! perfect for summer, or fall with a c",1
"I purchased this dress as an easy option to throw on after the gym or on a weekend trip without fuss. the fabric is soft, hangs well, and it is well-lined. but it's also a little more bilious than perhaps necessary to be beautiful and flowing. as in, i'm very comfortable in this dress, but it's not a dress i receive compliments while wearing. perhaps it reads as maternity wear without the belt.",1
"I am a curvy size 8. i loved the colors but found it looked maternity when unbelted and there was too much bunchy fabric at the waist when tied. i tend to like things that emphasize my waist, however.",0
"Beautiful detail. sweater is warm, soft, and very comfortable. fits perfectly. i was worried without having seen it in person that the lace detailing would be fragile, but it is knitted into the underlying sweater material. i have worn it no less than five times already and not a flaw or a pull in it.",1
"But like other reviewers said, it looks nothing like the picture of the model. i am 5'3"" and 110 lbs, i usually wear an xs in maeve and i ordered the xs petite - the straps are not adjustable so the top part of the dress is up too high and then there is just so much material, it looks like i'm 6 months pregnant. and i usually love loose dresses like this, but the way this falls really does make you look like you are hiding a sack of potatoes. so bummed, because the material is beautiful and i lo",0
"I so wanted to love this suit! it is so unique and cute, however it does not wear well on a short girl! i am 5""4 and the torso was much too short for me so the cut down the middle looked really wide and odd and the suit just made me look stumpy instead of sexy. also, for how expensive this suit it i also thought the material was pretty thin for how expensive this suit is. i'm sad to say it is going back.",0
"I fell in love with this dress when i saw it. i love the colors and pattern. i've just been on the fence whether it complements my hippy frame. i'm a size 8/10 right now. i do like it with or without the tie for different effects. one concern is that the website says hand wash and the tag on the seam says dry clean only. i usually don't buy dry clean clothes, but might make an exception for this one.",1
"I really, really wanted to take this home with me but decided against it. from the front this dress looks amazing when it was belted and i love the colors in it. however, it bunched like crazy in the back. i tried it without the belting and it just hung like a sack and was completely unflattering. if there were some way to get rid of the bunching in the back then i would have taken it home. but with the cost of the dress, i can't justify taking it to a tailor so it stayed. sigh. so close.",0
"This dress had so much potential. looked cute when i received it. put it on & couldn't wait to take it off. it's shapeless, top heavy & just overall unflattering. the material could be cute....on a totally different dress. don't waste your money.",0
"I'm 5'4"", 120lbs and the xs fits perfectly. the skirt is flattering and quality is nice. will be good for cooler days in the fall. a bit warm for a hot summer day, but nice for a night time event.",1
"Long-time ag jeans fan. lately though, i'm finding the material is much too stretchy. i wanted a good pair of jeans. if i wanted pajama jeans, i would've ordered them. i found the same thing with the steve capris i ordered (same review there).
so back both pairs went. 
it's a shame because the color was as pictured and just what i wanted. if only they had been made out of actual jeans material.",0
"I ordered this shirt in the purple stripe and was happy when it arrived and i really liked the color and style.   however, like the other reviewer, when i tried it on, the little circles on the front line up perfectly with your bra straps.  i even tried a different style bra and had the same result.  sadly i returned it yesterday.",0
"This jacket was cute, however, i am normally a large with a bit of room to spare.  this has the irritating issue of not fitting under the arms and across the chest and shoulders.  it is not my shape as most other brands at retailer fit me. this jacket is not sized correctly.",0
"The skirt material is super comfortable. hte cut is also pretty flattering, i don't hink this picture does the skirt justice. the regualr size was a little long on me, i would order a petite (if like me, you are 5'1.5""#, went xs #at 115 lbs). the skirt is also a bit stretchy, not stiff.

color is way prettier in person, i never looked twice at th skirt online, but in the store, it looked myuch prettier.",1
"Contrary to the first review, there is a zipper so while it wasn't easy to get on, it did fit over my bust. i found this too small and high waisted, and i already have a high waist so i can imagine it looking empire waisted on a normal torso. what i hated was the ridiculous inverted pleat in the front of the dress which is almost impossible to see in the online photo. it made my already busty frame even wider and more unflattering. the lining was nice and soft and the sleeve length and hemline l",0
"I have purchased many of retailer's henley tees throughout the years. this one is a bit special and just so feminine i had to get it black in my local store. i love the look of the crisp, white, but it was too sheer to wear to work without a cami, and i cannot layer camis in once it gets hot.

anyhow, this shirt is made in my favorite spring/summer tee shirt fabric: 100%s linen. linen gets so soft and drapey over time. the yoke is lace. the arms have a small ruching that is sewn, not buttoned up l",1
"These are light and airy and pretty. they also tore the third time i wore them and not on a seam - a little above the knee while i was lying in my bed.

they also do not slim the figure and the fabric is slightly see-through as it is so thin, therefore if you are looking for serious lounge pants - great - i would not leave the house in them... or turn over in bed in them.

when i sit, the slits fall down around my thighs. my son complimented my dress the other day because the slits give way",0
Bought the dress online and it only has an eye and hook at the top. the waist has no stretch and their isn't a zipper. you have to be a contortionist to get it over your head and shoulders. so cute in the pic but not realistic. going back.,0
"I had high hopes for this top but it didn't work for me at all. it shows your bra straps perfectly. plus, it was so big and boxy that it made me look about 10 pounds heavier. no thanks!",0
This is going to be a favorite. the fabric is substantial without being heavy. it has a beautiful drape. this blouse is loose but skims the body closer rather than being blousy. it works perfectly worn with a skirt or pants and belted or tucked but is not too blousy if left unbelted. i purchased the black with the lovely feather pattern. the colors are vibrant. i'm always looking for something black with some color because i tend to wear a lot of black on the bottom. this fit true to size. i am,1
Have to disagree with previous posters. i found just one of these on the sale rack in my local retailer (someone returned it from online) and it was adorable on. got many compliments in the dressing room area. other customers asked if there were more available but it's turns out it's an online exclusive. it does have a zipper. i recommend sizing up not because it runs small (i think it's pretty true to size) but i think it looks better a bit loose/drapery. fabric is soft and pretty. tailoring is f,1
This skirt is so flattering and comfortable!,1
"Found this vest in the sale section, actually rolled up in a ball on the floor! what a great find. the colors and texture are rich. strong navy blue base with rich other shades and texture. yes the vest runs big, but if you tie it from the back the bulky look is gone! love this way to wear a cocoon cut vest! the vest is in a size xs/sm and on my build works like a typical medium would be. perfect for work and lovely with jeans and skirts. washable wool blend that is soft with nice structure. to",1
"Great fabric, not too clingy and provides a forgiving sillhoette. very comfortable. perfect skirt for summer get togethers or shopping. may be a little long if you are on the short side. one thing i liked is that the skirt draped well and doesn't hang open or slide up. recommend particularly on sale.",1
"An retailer associate gave me this to try on since i love white clothing and lace. i tried on a large for my 5'9"", 36c. hourglass frame and found it to be a tad large and probably could go down a size. my thoughts are....
_______________
pros:
- breathable and comfortable fabric due to cotton/linen blend.
- lace detailing at the top is lovely.
- runs tts except i found the arms ran a tad small (and i have smaller circumference). but there's enough stretch.
_______________
cons:
- extremely sheer!",1
"Love this blazer - it's a heavy jersey fabric, which is comfortable all day, with no wrinkling. and it has a cute light grey jersey knit trim around the pockets which adds visual interest and keeps it from being a boring navy blazer. the sizing is correct - i wear a 6, and the 6 fits perfectly. it's got a slightly athletic 'boyfriend' fit - it's not boxy, but don't look for a really skinny tight fit around the waste.",1
I love this t-shirt! it's a little bit dressy because of the lace but the t-shirt material is great for casual wear. i tried on the white but ended up buying the black because the white is so sheer. i'll still have to wear a layering tank with it but the black just feels less sheer for some reason. really cute and nice quality t-shirt!,1
"This top is really beautiful, but looks absolutely horrible on my 5'9"" apple shaped body. in the words of my husband, i looked like a star trek villain.",0
"This is the softest shirt, super comfy, very baggy but i'd say true to size for the style. it is a bit thin and i'm worried how it will hold up, or would have given the full 5 stars. i'm not a usual fan of the turtle neck but this is so soft, i love it!",1
"This is not my usual style, but the print is gorgeous and the dress is really high quality. i'm glad i purchased. it definitely runs big- i am usually an xs or s depending on brand but i ordered an xs p. it fits pretty well and falls at the perfect length just above my knees (i'm 5'3, 110). it's a little shapeless still but that's the look. i'm still sort of wondering if i should have gotten an xxs but the xs p definitely works especially for the length. can't wait to wear this. amazing sale pri",1
"This shirt is so comfortable, soft, and super cute. definitely recommend!",1
"The model does not look as good in this shirt as it looks in real life. it is flowy, flattering, and elegant, not to mention warm and soft. i hope it holds up!",1
"Love the style, weight (not too hot) and look but it sheds all over any pants other than jeans. i also wore a white tank under it and it stained it blue. very disappointed",0
"I was so excited when i purchased this top! it was going to be my go to for running around, as it looked super cute with leggings and boots! the softness alone made me feel like i was wearing my pajamas.....so comfy! that all changed after one washing......it is now pilling and not nearly as soft as before! makes me sad, but it is going back!",0
"I wanted to love this dress so much so that i ignored earlier reviews and purchased it in two sizes to see if i could make it work. the fabric is gorgeous, but the fit was very unflattering. it's too large on top and hangs awkwardly in both sizes. i considered tailoring to make it work but with this pattern i felt like that would be a compromise. in the end i returned both sizes ast the fabric couldn't compensate for the very unflattering fit.",0
"I adore this dress! it's so charming. great quality, lovely fabric, beautiful color. the fit is supposed to be boxy and probably won't work on a beautiful curvy body. with a petite athletic body, i feel beautiful in it! i wear a small or xs and i definitely needed an extra small. pair it with black or camel, sandals or boots, it's lovely!",1
"Flattering, comfortable, and a fantastically versatile color and style. if you'd like the garment to fit about how it does on the model, i'd say that it's tts. the picture represents the color accurately - is a very dark, slate grey. i've found that the color is a great neutral - i can wear it with other neutrals or with colors, as featured on the model. the style is also really versatile - i can wear it as a stand-alone t-shirt, or under a blazer to work.

i've washed the garment once on the",1
Extremely well made tank top. great for work or a night out.,1
"Love love love this turtleneck! it's soft and cozy, and i've already reached for it on several chilly days. it definitely runs large. i sized down and it still has an oversized, swingy shape.",1
"It made me look extra thick in the middle--could pass for maternity wear. pretty colors. fabric is fine. it's just too shapeless and not flattering on me. i'm 5'11"" and it was also on the short side for me. even if it fit better, probably too short for my age (40s).",0
"Has to be one of my favorite retailer purchases! the shirt is so soft and can be paired with so many different items. the turtle neck will help keep you warm, although the actual material is a little thin. don't let that dissuade you though. you won't be disappointed by this purchase! i'm going to get the other color too :)",1
I was excited about this dress because i love the colors and print. the dress has no shape though and not in a good way. it's not flowy enough for the look of a shape dress but its not fitted enough to be flattering.,0
"Mutliple layers of buttery softness. i bought the blue and it's true to size. it is soo soft, i could wear this to sleep. it drapes beautifully. highly recommend it. now i want to buy all the colors!",1
"This dress is gorgeous and feels so soft! looks great with booties and flats! can be paired with so much! jackets, scarfs, long necklaces! so glad i bought it! i did down size to a small from my usual medium! and got the regular instead of petite! fit great",1
This tunic is lovely and versatile. looks great over a pair of jeans or as a dress!,1
I never write reviews although i do most of my shopping online but i had to write one for this tunic. i got it in the blue and sized down from a small to extra small- although i ordered both to see. the smaller size fit better around the shoulders. it is a bit retro funky and elegant at the same time. great price for such a quality piece.,1
"Bought this for my 21 year old daughter, and she loves it. the blue color is very pretty and she says she gets lots of compliments and requests to ""touch it"" because the fabric is gorgeous. it's a bit boxy, and a little short to wear as a dress for her 5'9"" height - she says she risks showing her undies when she raises her arms. but she likes is so much she's just keeping her arms down. :-)",1
"I sized down to an xs from my usual size small, and it fits perfectly. it is cropped but i like the swingy shape that will work well with high-waisted bottoms. i did have to get a replacement because my first top had some beading coming off when i received it in the mail, but this new one seems much more sturdy.",1
This top is very cute and is made out of soft material that isn't clingy at all. and you don't have to be stick thin for it to look good. i don't like to show my arms normally but this top is very flattering all around. i love it!,1
"As soon as you get up close to this sweater, you will notice that the bird on the front is of an interesting kind of material-almost like carpet that has been shaved waaaaaaaay down so that the little fibers are sticking straight up and a fraction of a millimeter high. i was not excited about this texture and can imagine it will be a huge magnet for collecting lint and dust throughout the day. the fit was way off on this one for me and was not flattering at all. it wasn't for me at all even thou",0
"This top had so much potential! i bought the striped colorway in an xs, which is my normal size. i am a 32d with an athletic build so the sleeves are tighter on my arms than pictured, although they are adjustable. the top of the shirt fits perfectly, but the bottom is very wide and short. i'm only 5'2"" but it's still just a tad shorter than i'd like. i wish it was slightly more fitted and then it would be perfect. unfortunately, this one is going back.",0
"This top is absolutely beautiful. i especially love the richness of the black and burgundy one! i am typically a size medium but purchased the large because i wanted it to fit a little bigger and longer - i was going for more of a tunic-style. if you're broad-shouldered like i am, you may opt for a bigger size as well because the sleeves can look a little silly if its too small.",1
I love this piece! they're calling it a tunic but its plenty long enough to wear without any pants. i usually wear a small/xsmall in retailer sizes and i definitely went with the xsmall. size down to avoid the potato sack look. i think this piece is so great for fall. definitely a must buy!,1
"Was excited to wear the dress for the first time. but while standing in front of the mirror putting makeup on, the seam between the body and sleeve just started to unravel. strangest thing - just a random hole appeared :(.",0
"The cut, fabric and detail on this dress is incredible. it runs a bit small though, usually i wear a 00p, but the 0p is plenty snug. 5'4'',110lbs,32c, fits just as on the model, looks much like photos, but slightly more yellow in tone.",1
"I love the way this dress moves on you and the high low. a medium fit me perfectly. i am 5'8"" and the long part in the back barely touches the floor in flat shoes. the colors are sort of fall, but the top is like a sun dress. i think you could wear this any time of year with the appropriate accessories. i wore it with a 3/4 length sleeved cardigan and sandals in oct. and it was perfect. the fabric feels nice, great quality. it's on sale so you have nothing to loose!",1
I wear an xxs petite and this dress was still large. i like that look so i'm okay with that but the sides do stick out a little bit if you have a smaller frame.,1
"The large is perfect for me and is just my style - not too baggy but just shapely enough to where to the office with or without leggings, as the fall approaches. i bought the blue; the color is rich and saturated. the material is soft and all around comfortable, which is my number one factor in buying clothes. love its versatility too, since a jacket and scarf can dress it up. shoes also dress up or dress down the dress. all in all a bargain.",1
"I absolutely love this dress! it's a great summer dress that's flirty and fun. i feel this dress runs pretty true to size except in the bust area. the buttons at the top pull a little bit on me unless i wear a bra that pushes the girls up and together. i'm a 32ddd just so you have an idea. i'm 5'10, about 145-150 lbs and i'm a 4-6. in dresses i'm usually able to get away with a 4. i have a bigger bust and bum but a super, tiny waist. i'm just barely able to get away with wearing a 4 in this dres",1
Love the buttons because i am currently nursing my 5 month old. easy access. i'm a 32dd 5'9 147 and it fits fine in the top. got a size 4... love how it flows over my pear shaped hips. i thought it was a sunflower print but actually moths! haha very cute. wish i would have waited and got the sale price... bought my it in may for mother's day!,1
"I'm 5'8 - 38""?30""?38"" - i bought these leggings in a size large (blue motif) to wear under a really cozy organic cotton tunic in an attempt to create a sophisticated-looking, comfortable look. when i first it them on they felt like compression leggings and i wondered if they were too small. i wore them for a day and now they are falling down around the waist and the crotch is hanging. i spend so much time trying to hike them back up - i'm not at all comfortable and i doubt i'm looking sophistica",0
"I adore maeve tops, and this is no exception. i'm small on top (32a), ordered my usual maeve size 0. i'm 5'3, 105 lbs, ordered regular (not petite) because the front of this blouse is already short. fits appropriarely, but take note it is much more blousy than it appears in the photo. you have to try it on, either you'll love it or hate it. i do love it's slightly oversized blousy fit, so i was not hesitant to put it in the dryer on low for about 15-20 minutes. well... it shrunk up like nothing",1
"I was so excited to get this dress, and it was such a disappointment! it looks so cute on the model, but it was very different when i got it. the color is a lot more yellow than i thought it would be, and the pattern just looked a bit strange--it stood out more against the yellow instead of looking neutral. the dress fit really awkwardly on the top. the straps were way too long, and the chest area was practically baggy when i put it on. i normally wear a 4p, and i ordered down to a 2p. the waist",0
"I actually paid full price for this over the winter and i'm not sorry i did. great top w/lovely fabric. i usually wear a small but in this top, an xs, so it runs a bit large.",1
"I look like i put a baggy bag over my head. also, the material really seemed like fake velvet to me.",0
"I wanted to love this dress, but sadly i will be returning. the color looked fairly different in person than on the model. i thought it was a browner/neutral hue, but the dress is almost like a yellow seersucker-ish with brownish moth printing. was cuter than expected! the sweetheart neckline is darling, but that is where it fit me poorly. i have a 34c bust, and the cups of the size 4 were gaping on me in the front and all along the arm holes. the straps were also way too long and falling off my",0
"Very disappointed when i received this. the colors and ombre fabric are beautiful. beading and embroidery make it a even more unique top however the shape ruins all of that. first it is nearly a crop top. second, it is boxy and it's attempt to be a swing top only makes it bulky. third, need to size down 2 sizes. had to return this.",0
"I love this top and the beading is beautiful, but just like everyone else, it was way too large. i normally wear a lg, but the large looks and feels like a 3xl. beautiful but large",0
"This is a really beautiful dress, the pictures don't capture it well enough. was looking for a comfortable shift dress that is versatile, this fit the bill. for reference, i am 5'3"" and weigh around 113 lbs, i got an xxs...and it was a bit baggy, but shift aren't supposed to be tight. also has some fun details! look forward to wearing this!",1
"I wasn't sure i would like this top, but wanted something different, than what i already own. i ordered it in an xs (my usual size) and it is slightly loose (which i knew it would be based on the cut). it looks great with jeans or shorts. i purchased the black and white striped one because it looks more interesting. the ties may drive me crazy- we'll see. i like the weight of the fabric, i just hope it doesn't pill. for reference, i am 5'3 and 123lbs. i usually wear a 2/4.",1
"This top is a nice piece to transition into fall. it goes well with jeans, but it could also be dressed up with black pants.",1
"Runs a little big, but cute and comfortable. also shows bra straps a bit on each side, even when i ordered a size smaller. overall, very happy with it.",1
"This was a cute design, but didn't work for me. the fabric was slightly see-through, and too tight around the bust.",1
"I bought this dress as a birthday present to myself which i wore to a recent weekend vacation to dallas, texas and i absolutely love it. i love the color and the design of the dress as i think it is timeless and i will get a lot of use out of it for years to come. 
however, this dress is tight in the chest area and i would recommend sizing up. i am 5'10"", 156 pounds, and usually wear a us size 6, but when i tried this dress on in a size 6 the dress stopped buttoning up underneath my bust. i end",1
Love! color and fabric are beautiful! new fav,1
"I'm not sure why it's considered a ""blue motif,"" i think it's more on the black and cream side. other than that this is a great silk top for warmer weather, it's lightweight and airy and you'll probably want to wear a nude bra underneath. looks great with jeans and heels for a fun night out as well as trousers for work. i'm 5'7"" and almost 130 lbs with a 34a bust and a small fit great.",1
"I ordered this sweater and it is beautiful.... i am returning though because it fits snug through chest, shoulders and upper arms. i am an xs - and that is what i ordered and it was tight through these areas. if you are busty it would be a definite problem.",1
"Runs small. great quality. haven't washed it yet, but guessing it will shrink if i dry it. awesome texture- waffle knit. i got the stripe. it has a removable palm tree pin!",1
"I purchased all 4 of the color/pattern offered. all fit beautifully and have washed up great with no shrinkage with line dry. the only pair i had retuned were the blue motif because they were made from a very different material with not near as much stretch and felt much smaller to me and not as comfortable. the pattern was cute and may work just fine with those who have a different build. i felt these were in general true to size. no doubt i will wear these all winter!
thanks antro!!",1
"This is a beautiful blouse. very pretty and looks well made. unfortunately i had to send it back. i'm looking for a more classic cut. it has an a line/tent shape. when i put it on and put my arms above my head, the bottom of the blouse was up to my bra!
i would order from this brand again.",1
I was so excited for this dress to come. i am 5&#39;1&quot; and 100lbs so i ordered and xs petite. it was literally falling down around my shoulders and gigantic all around. maybe on someone taller this would have looked great. i was also disappointed that the blue shown online was not accurate. my dress was a much lighter blue. back to the store it goes.,0
"I have nothing but positive comments to say about this sweater. i'm 5'6, 130 pounds and i got a medium because my shoulders are a bit wide and my sweater fits me just as it does the model. it's not bulky but it is very warm, and the colors are out of this world! a very high quality and unusual piece that will be in my wardrobe for many years.",1
"I love the color (coral/pink) and the open shoulder design of this top, but it's too blousy at the bottom (way too much fabric). i ordered a small. i am 5'4"" and 120 lbs. i might try an xs if they still have them in stock. fabric is comfortable. the ties on the sleeves add a special touch.",1
"Even though i'm currently at a 34f in the bust the size 12 works for me, although i did install 2 snaps between the top 3 buttons to keep everything in line. i'm 5'5"" and my torso is often too short for regular sized clothes. the straps were too long for me, but to my delight i discovered that this particular dress is designed to unstitch and tailor the strap length with ease. with those small alterations this dress fits like it was made for me, plus the pattern and fabric are top notch. i tried",1
"I was really excited to see what this looked like in person. when i unpacked this shirt i was shocked to see what how short it looked. the colors are very close to what you see online but the shirt is super boxy. i have a smaller torso and it barely came to below my waist. you can't tell by the picture but this shirt can fit at least 2 people in the width. when i tried it on, it didn't look as boxy but still a really weird cut! it was disappointing because it looks so cute online! i will be retu",0
"I wanted to love this dress, especially because it's been given good reviews. i ordered the blue and tried it on. the fit was pretty good and the color is pretty and deep. i did not like the seam that ran around the drop waist. it created a weird allusion that the two pockets in front was actually a continuous pouch around the dress. i also did not like the neckline - there is fabric added on the shoulders that's in a different fabric and makes it look like you're wearing a t-shirt underneath th",0
"Love these. wearing them today with a longer tunic style denim shirt and cardigan and boots. nice subtle print. i think they run about 1 size small. i'm normally a size 0/25. the xs was a bit snug and the material stretched so you could see white around the seams where the print pulled. size s fits great without any pulling and waistband comes up far enough. incidentally, i like them so much bought the same leggings in plain black elsewhere and the size s was the best fit in those too. love love",1
"Really wanted to love this top but it was too boxy for me! really pretty deep wine colors and a great plaid, but overall it did not give me any shape and it was returned,",0
My girlfriend and i both purchased these leggings in grey. we love the color because it goes with so many things.the problem is they do not fit the same. hers ran true to size and mine ran small. i am tempted to reorder another pair to see if they fit differently.,0
Awesomely different top. the first time i wore it i didn't wash it so it was big on me. it shrunk from washing so it fits better now. there is some unraveling of the frayed edges though.,1
I just received this and absolutely love it !!! i love cold shoulder designs and this one is unique and so well made. i am usually a size small and it fit perfectly. i would say it runs true to size and will look perfect with white or black pants and a cute sandal. i am so glad i got it. love the quality .,1
"Cute shirt. i'm 5'3"" and 120 lbs. size s fits perfectly. a little shorter in the back than i'd like but great for layering.",1
"I usually love maeve and generally feel like everything they make was made for me. sadly, this dress is a definite exception, which could easily have been solved by changing the construction of the dress. as other reviewers stated, the dress does run small, but even if you size up, if you have any breasts at all, the dress will pull at the buttons, causing them to gape (i'm only a b cup, so not on the large side.) i'm pretty sure this is why the model has her arms crossed in the picture. i love",0
"I love this dress. it is a fun and flirty summer dress. i think it can be dressed up or worn casually. i am a 36c, 29"" waist, 40"" hips. i bought a size 8 and it fits me great. as others said, it is a little snug across the chest, but i think it is supposed to be. with the proper bra it fits very comfortably! i am going to wear it for mother's day brunch!",1
"This piece is a winner solely b/c of the sleeves. otherwise, it's a plain, large tee. however, the sleeves are gorgeous and so unique! had they had my size left, i would have purchased in other colors (i got pink). it runs large, so size down.",1
I have featured two pictures below. one is size s. the other is xs petite. i'm 5 feet 120 and a 34 d. i highly recommend this dress. i definitely could have gone either way. but felt sizing down would be more flattering.,1
The details on this dress are lovely. the embroidery is wonderful. but the fit on this dress is just not for me. it is very baggy and shapeless. it doesn't have any curves at all so it just drapes down me and looks formless. really unflattering. sad but it's going back.,0
"I'm not sure if i only received part of this dress as a mistake, but i received the chiffon shell, but there was no slip as pictured. it makes it kind of difficult to wear when the entire thing is sheer. i had high hopes, but sadly, this is being returned. the xs is out of stock now, so i can't even reorder. bummer.",0
This jacket is just as stunning in person as online. high quality and just overall fabulous design. as much as i loved it though i couldn't get over the fact i was jingling every time i moved. it seemed like it could cause piling issues and i thought it might get annoying wearing for an entire day. i loved this and wanted so hard to keep it but i need functional chic pieces not noise makers. anyways fit was great looked just like the model on me so i would recommend but with caution as for this,1
"I'm on the shorter (5''3"") side of the spectrum and usually wear an xs in retailer. this is a lovely suit but it didn't work at all for me. it might work well on a taller person or someone who is longer waisted. the ruching and fuller cut leg was not flattering on me at all. it was very tight and pinched. sadly, i returned it.",0
Loved this online and it did not disappoint. lightweight and super flattering. fabric is sheer with a lovely windowpane pattern. top front of the bodice is lined. looks great with a pair of jeans. super easy to care for. toss in washer in a mesh bag and it comes our perfectly. will likely be a go-to summer piece.,1
"Love this top. very flattering on an hour glass figure because even though it has a more of an empire waist it is not so volumous as to overwhelm the figure --as so many retailer tops are these days. one caution: i had to go up a size to accommodate my bust.  normally a size 6 or small in retailer tops but a 34dd, so went up to a size 8.  the top is more snug around the bustline so just be warned if you are well endowed.  
the fabric is sheer but not overly so, embroidery is well done. over all a b",1
"I noticed the reddish one (actually, barney-purple) in my local store and had to try it one, since i like this cut of dresses from my teenage years. the color was my main concern, but this proved perfect overall. it is low cut in the bust, but a scarf can fix it for us modest girls. there were quite a few loose threads on the lace and stiching that i had to trim off. for the reference, i am 5'4"", 120 lbs, and an xs was perfect.",1
"The skirt has a great cute design and great colors and great shape. but it runs very small and short. this company needs to provide a better fit, and large sizes if they run small.",0
"This top would be great if it were longer and the neck wasn't so open. even for a boatneck, the neck was too wide. for those that don't mind showing their stomachs this top will be okay. the material is nice and stretchy and i like the stripes but just way too short for me.",0
"This sweater was pretty short. beyond that, when i raised my arms, the thickness of the sweater caused the shoulders to rise up and stay there when i put my arms down.",0
"You will need to get these pants hemmed if you are not six foot tall, as they are quite long.  but they are so cute that the extra alteration expense is worth it.  imagine wearing pants that feel like pajamas but that look like a million bucks.  is this not every woman's fashion fantasy?",1
"I am 5,7"" 135 lbs the small fit well in the bust but no shape . it was just big and frumpy . it went back .",0
"I was so excited when these pants went on sale! tried them on in-store and ordered online. tried both medium and small and they both work, thanks to the elastic waistline. they do run very long, so if you're super tall these are great, otherwise prepare to wear very tall heels or get them hemmed.",1
"This skirt looks great on, i didn't even think before buying it, planning to wear it all summer. so the aesthetic is great. quality and design, not so much. you get exactly one good wear out of it before the folding absolutely disintegrates, it is not sewn in or built to last. 

then, it looks like a cheap sarong over a cheap miniskirt. i thought the dry cleaner might be able to fix it, but they said they would have to resew the whole garment, not exactly what you want to hear with almost bran",0
"I absolutely loved these pants when i tried them on. i am 5'1 and will definitely need it hemmed because they are so so long. but i'm fine with that because these pants are so unique and gorgeous. i'm 130 lbs usually a size small but xs fit me just fine. i will have to say though, i am very upset because my pants shipped with a huge tear in the waistband. the only way i was able to try them on was because the last bit of the waistband was hanging on by a thread. so the quality isn't too great. a",0

"These are huuuuge! i'm 5'8"" 117lbs. i ordered the small, but unfortunately they were way to big. i might have tried the xs, however didn't care for the pattern as much as the picture. i think these would work better on taller fuller figure girls.",0
"I do love these pants, but they are way too long for me and will have to return them. the petite sizes are sold out. it is true that the elastic in the waistband is not attached to the waistband fabric and does get twisted when you put the pants on. however, to me that is not a show-stopper. sorry i cannot keep them! i do love retailer and will continue shopping with you!",1
"This dress was a 'maybe' for me online but when i tried it on i was totally won over! i got the raspberry, which is a really pretty color. i have 34dd chest and it fits nicely on me, fairly true to size and is super flattering on me- more so than most swing dresses. love it.",1
I purchased the 0p online and it was so incredibly short on me it wouldn't even serve as a tunic!! it was also so tight in the bust area that i could not pull it down because there is absolutely no give in the material. the berry color was not as bright as it had appeared online but in fact was a very muddled color that seemed to make the material look even more cheap. i would need to size up considerably to have good fit without give in the bust and arms and judging by the structure of the dres,0
"This dress is gorgeous as displayed at store. color is vibrant, but the one i ordered looked dull and wrinkles very easily. i wore it to a ceremony and the seatbelt left me wrinkled before i arrived. the top is very wide and best to wear strapless.",0
"I purchased this dress in the berry color. it is beautiful and feminine. the length fit just like in the picture. i love all the detail and ease of this dress. i'm 5'2"" 34d and purchased a size 2. it fits true to size.",1
"This is a gorgeous dress with a great, boho styling! the color in person is exactly as it's shown. it is wearable all throughout the year - easily paired with boots or sandals. while the fit is true to size, i found the lace detailing has no stretch to it so the bodice is a little tight. i love this dress and can't wait to wear it.",1
"This shirt has a vibrant color and beautiful neck line, but unfortunately i had to send it back. it is short waisted with a lot of material in the back. had it been 1-2 inches longer it may flare out, but based on the length on me, it ended up looking like a shrunken tent. for reference, i am 5'8 with a long torso.",0
"I loved these online and am even more in love since receiving them in the mail. the band on top is a great touch for these flowy pants! i'm 5'9 and they are still a little long, but other than that they are perfect.",1
"I splurged on this pajama set for myself and now regret it. even though the design is adorable, the knitted fabric contains acrylic and started pilling a lot within the first week of wear. after a month and a couple washes, it looks horrible. it may be the worst case of pilling i've ever seen in a fabric. so so disappointed. it initially fit true to size but has stretched out a bit over time.",0
"Maternity like, and although the back is really cool, there is too much material in the front and it is almost like thin ribbed long underwear/pajama. returned.",0
"I agree with the previous reviewer that this shirt is way to sheer at least for me. if you don't mind wearing a cami under it or your bra and skin showing in the back especially, then it might be for you. i did not feel like it was very good quality either the print is really cute, but then it did not button all the way up and i like the option because i think they drape better when they have buttons to the top wether you choose to button up.",0
"This dress had my attention immediately online, but in person it was even prettier. i would not say the colors are very ""pink"" as the color selection indicates, rather browns (with possible pink undertones) and yellows, and even a splash of dark green in the print here and there. there isn't a ton of give or stretch to the fabric so a larger chest may need to size up. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, curvy/muscular frame and the size 4 fit just right (though i don't have a ton of extra room in the chest",1
I am very happy with this shirt. i don't like skin tight clothes. i bought this top a bit loose but it does not look like i am wearing a sack. it is tunic length on me so i have worn it with jeans and boots. i love the way it flows while i walk. very flattering on. would definitely recommend!,1
"I bought this for our daughter. i tried it on when it arrived and the material is fabulous and feels soooo good against the skin. the purple is a stunning color - very subdued and classy. if she does not like it on christmas after gifts are opened, guess who is going to keep it for herself! if she loves it as much as i think she will, then i'll just have to get one for myself. the pleats in the back are very flattering. best of all is the fabric. it is luxurious. thank you retailer for yet another",1
"This would be a great dress if it was sized correctly. i ordered my usual xs and was shocked at how large it was. sadly the gray/black color is no longer available in xxs (a size i would never typically order) and is not available in petite sizes. i liked the design, the fabric, and the color. if you are lucky enough to be larger than a size xs, i recommend ordering one size smaller than your usual.

for reference, i'm 5'3"", 111 lbs, 28dddd/30ddd, and usual wear a size 0 in dresses and pants (i",0
"Loved how this draped and im super petite 5'1""(32b bust) and this was seriously one of the most ill fitting items i have every owned. i purchased the pxs and it was huge. i hope this has a better fit as the other reviewers seem to have a more positive review. i was just appalled as to how bad the measurements were off. unfortunately the straps are not adjustable so this went below my chest. too sad retailer, please get the fit right!!",0
Beautiful pattern and shape! however i had to send it back! it is extremely see through and ran very small! i even sized up and it still pulled in the bust area! maybe someone with a smaller bust might fit them better!,0
"If you're a curvy girl like me this shirt is very flattering. hangs nicely in the front, not too clingy. also has that accordian back which is very nice because it hides my back fat. the plum is gorgeous! was king it for the first time so can't yet comment on how it holds up with washing or whether the back retains its accordian loom with the hang to dry recommendation.",1
"This dress is beautifully made, but it does not flair slightly as in the photo, it stick out like a tent. it might be a good maternity dress. the fabric is somewhat stiff andheavy with a slight texture.",0
This shirt is thin and shapeless. the quality is h&m esque. unflattering. not a fan,0
I really liked the style of this top but it's way oversized! i'm petite and drowned in this top even though i got it in an xs. the material is nice but i can't see i had a feeling for the cut because it runs so big. this one is going back to the store!,0
"I was extremely disappointed when this arrived. it's nothing like the red color shown, rather it's a very dull reddish color. as other reviews have suggested, it is very thin and runs large. i have to return.",0
This fits a little short on me and i'll have to wear a shirt underneath even with a high waist pant. i still adore it! get it for the price!,1
"This color is really cool because it can go with black, grey, or tan shoes. the back pleats are unique and do not add bulk. the back is also lined, so you don't need a tank. fits tts and i thought it was fairly flattering. on sale, this is a great deal.",1
"Love this dress? very flattering fit, though it runs big. i usually wear a s/m and got an xs in this dress. the only concern is the fabric is thin, but love it nonetheless.",1
"I like this top, but it does not fit me correctly. i am 5'1"", and have a larger bust, 34 c. this shirt fits in the length, but is tight in the bust. i would have to buy this in a medium. i normally wear an xs or s. the quality is better than most t shirts, and i ordered the red. the red is a deep and striking color, and one of the better reds i've seen this season. the biggest problem i had was the cut of the shirt. the top cuts in and doesn't provide coverage, my bras are not covered by this to",0
So comfortable and soft but starting pilling after one wear! sending back.,0
"I loved the delicate and feminine print of this blouse at first sight. the fit was perfect - just enough room to be flattering and comfortable, without adding any unnecessary bulk. the style and print could even be paired with a more classic skirt and pumps and go to the office. the length was also spot-on - it's not too long to be a tunic, yet long enough to wear with skinny jeans or even leggings on an errand-running day. the blouse is very lightweight and sheer, making it that much more comfo",1
"I ordered a medium in this and it definitely fits more like a large. i liked the color & the sleeves, but tying the tie at the neck looks silly on me and leaving it open shows too much cleavage. overall, it is just shapeless and too much fabric on me. i'm sending this one back.",0
"The design is gorgeous, the fit is great and the fabric drapes beautifully and is very comfortable. however, it's extremely see thru.",0
"I really love this camisole, but it's shorter than i expected.",1
"When i saw this skirt on line, i wasn't impressed--especially at the price. but then i saw it in the store and i had to have it! it's beautiful. definitely a colder weather skirt due to the nice weight of the fabric. the colors are lovely and subtle, with a little sheen, ensuring you can wear it with many tops and for many occasions, from everyday to dressier. length is just at the bottom of the knee for me (5'7""), with a flattering and comfortable cut.",1
Purchased for myself and loved the fabric and unique design. it runs very large and the size smaller was not available so it was returned.,1
"I tried this dress on in the store. i loved the fabric and color, but the fit was huge, no matter how much i sized down. there are full dresses and tunics that are supposed to be loose, but this was shapeless in an unflattering way. i was attracted to the style and color, but the execution left much to be desired.",0
This is such a great addition to my fall wardrobe. this is so cute! i'm 5'9 and this fits perfectly. i don't usually do well with some of the cropped pieces but this one has such a complementary cute. the sleeves are just the right length. i've had lots and lots of complements on this one! it's a keeper!,1
"I ordered the dress on-line. this dress looked pretty, the material was soft and comfortable, the length was perfect, but the zipper was totally out of place. it bulged out in a weird way which made it look like the dress was torn. i had to return the dress. i normally don't see a problem at this level in retailer clothes.",0
I was worried this skirt might look too much like a bedspread. but it is so gorgeous on and the cut is so flattering. i ordered a petite small and it fits perfectly. great fall/winter skirt.,1
"This sweater is so well made and uniquely designed. one of the main reasons i love retailer is for how toy make wool sweaters, timeless, affordable, and versatile.

worth the money!",1
Love the dress but ended up returning it as i'm not sure how often i would wear it. the only down fall is the dress is straight so you have to take smaller steps but stunning dress!!!,1
"I was looking for a cross between a light, fall-wool jacket and a cardigan and this is it! the red version looks festive in the winter, and the hood adds a bit of spunk. looks great both open and buttoned. i received many compliments on this the first time i wore it.",1
"I saw this dress online and fell in love with it. it is just as beautiful in person too. very delicate, but receive so many compliments every time i wear. it is two separate pieces, a slip dress and the overlying fringe dress. i am 5'4"" and need a 2 inch wedge heel to keep the bottom from dragging. probably could have tried to order the petite but figured i'd probably be wearing heals anyway. i normally wear a 6/8 in dresses and the medium fit perfectly and is so flattering! the top half is flow",1
I had to have this jacket! looks much better in person. i bought the navy color. the fit is great. it has a flowy bottom and is unstructured. i wear a dark navy t shirt or cami underneath. great with jeans and over the knee boots or booties. its a bit heavy and bulky to wear under a coat.,1
"I automatically knocked off one star because every brand that offers size xs (and many also offer xxs), should also care about us size 14/16/xls as well. i ordered a size large, and of course it shows every bump and love handle in back, but i recreated a look from my local retailer's window. they showed a long unbuttoned cotton weave dress over this crochet dress. (the closest dress pictured online to what i saw is the ""mabli maxi dress"", but imagine it opened if it had buttons, and in blue.) with",0
"I bought this online in dark green after trying on the burgundy. i usually wear a medium (5'2"", 120) but i looked better in the small in this jacket. the combination of very deep green, black and tan is beautiful. the cut is very flattering with the jacket open or snapped closed. it is nice enough to wear with black pants or skirt but looks just as good with jeans. i am in my 60's and this look is chic and fresh without being too ""young"" for my age. it's also very well made. i love it.",1
"Beautiful dress. flowing but not too much volume, not too short but not dowdy, gorgeous deep jade color with chartreuse accents, flattering waist (not sure why the model is covering that part up, but it's a nice waist with a tie belt). i think it looks really smashing in person. not too formal, perfect for a daytime event like a bridal shower.",1
"I had high hopes for this sweater and when i found it on sale online, i jumped at the opportunity. i am 5'11"", slender and always wear a small in retailer tops. i purchased this in the mint , size small and as soon as i opened the bag, i had doubts. the fabric is terrible, thin and scratchy. it is not soft and supple as i had imagined. the mint color looks faded and the shape is awful. the length of the arms hits in a bizarre spot, the overall length of the sweater cuts me off at the torso and the",0
I sized down in this and it fit perfectly! i normally opt for petite in skirts but i stuck to regular for this skirt and it was much more flattering . adorable and well made!,1
"Tried this on yesterday in the fitting room and i really wanted to get it but two problems - 1. not made for c cup bra women or larger and 2. the ruffles come right out of the nipple line area of the chest, so when you see yourself at a profile view, there's these ruffles that look like they're coming out of your chest. just sayin'. not for me.",1
"Great dress, true to size....wore it to dinner one night while in a beach vacation friends, got tons of compliments! you have to be careful when putting it on, as it may snag! otherwise, highly recommended!!",1
"So this is available in the store in a reddish coral color, see the #your retailer pictures and you'll see someone wearing it under the gray blazer. anyway, i tried it on and the fit was very flattering for a tunic. the front of the sweater hit me just at the waist and the front draped nicely. somehow the back was slightly hugging my back side but not tight or restricted. i ended up ordering the black and navy online because the fit was fantastic and will go with so many things. nothing shee",1
I just bought this and tried it on on a whim and am so happy i did! it's so much more flattering on than this photo depicts. i think it'll be one of my summer staples this year! give it a try!,1
This jacket is sweet and swingy and showing an early sixties vibe that i adore. a bit cropped and wide so definitely size down so your proportions don't look off. i took my medium and it was way too wide and unflattering so i switched to a sp. looks and feels great with layers.,1
Loved how this top looked online and couldn't wait to get it. i ordered the xs and it was huge and also very short in length compared to the picture online. i love the fabric and design but the fit was totally off. this is going back!,0
"This sweater totally caught my eye online and when it arrived, it was even better than on the website. gorgeous colors---kind of a retro look, but more modern and updated. very happy with my purchase!",1
"Such a pretty skirt. i think it's a very versatile piece. a bit heavier, can't wait to wear when it cools down more. i saw the dress that is similar to the skirt in the catalog last month and loved it too. note the skirt does not have the same shine in the fabric that the dress does.",1
"This is one of my new favorite dresses!! i ordered this in pink, and think it looks even more gorgeous in person that it does on the model. it's more of a reddish color. the dress hugs my body in a flattering way. i'm a 34b and the dress fits very comfortably, but it might be a tight fit for someone with a larger bust. i'm usually a small for retailer dresses and the small fit like a glove. it is wonderfully flowy and extremely elegant. i can't wait to wear this out!!",1
"This dress can be flattering on any figure type - but especially for women who need a little curve. i always wear a 6 in hd, and this fits nice and snug around the middle with a becoming flirty skirt that is lower in the back than front. flat chested women will have to fill it out with a padded bra. it may not be a great cut for a short person, as it has a long line to it and lots of busy-ness. only drawback, which depends on your taste, is the yellow pattern - it's a weird kind of greeny yellow",1
"This tunic is comfortable and casual. it is as pictured and flattering. the two materials make it flattering. i ordered the white, and it is see through. it really does need a camisole, which i found a little distracting given the fact that it is already layered. i which i had ordered another color, because it is cute.",1
"This was such an impulse buy- i bought it online during a sweater sale- and i am so glad i did! this is definitely one of my favorite recent purchases. it definitely seems more like a coat than a sweater, but it is lightweight. i ordered the red and it is beautiful. it looks great buttoned or left open and i think this could be dressed up or down (though it does have a hood, so that gives it a slightly more casual feel). it fits true to size- and it is definitely shorter in the front than the ba",1
"I really wanted to like this dress. the material, design, length and fit all over was perfect, except for the armholes- too big and the ruffles came right upto the nipple line. not comfortable with that. sadly, had to return.",0
"I like the colors, material and style of this sweater but not a fan of the sizing.  the xs/s was far too short for me and the m/l was great in length but had a tremendous amount of extra volume.  i am 5'/6"" size 8.",0
"I bought this dress because it was cute, swinging and lightweight -- seemingly perfect for this hot nyc summer. after on wash and dry, the dress is already ripped around two buttons. i'll still wear it but i don't think it'll last until next summer. kind of pitiful since it wasn't a cheap-o dress. also it is big but that seemed to be sort of the point.",0
"After reading the other reviewers i decided to try this out. unfortunately, the material does not fall nicely on me and the belt hits in an unflattering spot. i like the idea but it's just not a flattering cut or material. going back!",0
"I ordered a size large, however as a large, my chest is large as well. this nighty barley covered me (in the chest region). the rest of the body fit well.",0
"This arrived this week and i was so disappointed. the proportions are all wrong--- from the empire waist to the dolman sleeves, to the weird texture added to the material. if i could sum up this jacket with one word it would be ""weird"".",0
"Loved almost everything about this top. the colors are great, comfortable fit, but the length was a little too long for my 5'4 frame. i also wasn't a big fan of the large side slit. i would still recommend this great top.",1
"I definitely think this may have worked had i tried on a petite-sized version for the length. i was not at one of the stores with the petites. i did feel like at 5'2"" the regular size is just too long. i tried a size 4 on with leggings and that didn't look right. the size 4 seemed fine (34b chest, 118 lbs). maybe if i had a different pair of pants on but the slits up the sides of the shirt made it look not quite right with leggings. i kept thinking the shorter size would have helped. i really li",1
"I don't have the right body to pull this off. too many awkward styling issues (length, slits, tie, stitch quality) so this will have to go back. maybe if i was taller and slimmer this would be good. alas, it isn't meant to be...",0
"I loved this top online and even more when i opened it up. however, the quality of the stitching is poor. where the seam comes together at the hip on both sides, the stitching is very loose and appears to be coming undone. i was bummed and am sending it back today.",0
This top is well made and would be cute but huge. this top has no shape and is way big. back this goes.j,0
"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality, cut, and softness of this dress. it can be dressed up or down, with or without leggings/tights, and is cute with boots or flats. my only complaint is that the sleeves are not near as long as what is shown in the photo. i'd say more like 3/4 sleeves. thankfully there is elastic at the cuffs, so the sleeves can be pushed up, and the the material can slightly drape over the elastic.",1
Dress is lovely - the sleeves were shorter than i thought but otherwise nice fabric and very pretty cut!!,1
Overall nice material and styling but be prepare for it to be huge. i purposely sized down and i still felt like i was swimming in this.,1
"I found it very thin and much more sheer than i expected. not sure i could get away with wearing it without a slip.sadly i'll be returning it. also, runs a bit large. would have returned it for an xs if i loved it.",0
"While this is cozy and well made, the problem lies with the unavoidable exposure of the inside of the poncho, which looks unfinished. had the inside been lined or had the hue of the stripes continued through the material, the draped look of this piece would be gorgeous. unfortunately, the faded backside of the pattern (a glimpse of it under model's left hand), viewable through the very large arm holes (and impossible to hide), disrupts the effortless, fluid feel that a poncho should have. i was",0
"I love this shirt! it is so soft and a bit see through, so recommend wearing a camisole underneath. perfect with jeans! the fit is slightly boxy, but works well.",1
"Loved the look of this wool and so well made! problem was it literally would have been better on a bed as a blanket than on my body as a blanket coat. just overwhelmed me and didn't look good. i'm 5/9"" and 160 lbs so i'm no shrinking violet just too heavy of fabric.",0
"I loved this top when i saw it online. i was able to go in the store and try it on and sadly, it is not the top for me. if you have a large chest, then this top will gather at your cleavage and give an awful appearance. the fabric falls in and even the sales associate agreed that it was unsightly. if i were an a or b, this probably would have worked. i should have known to stay away from a pleated top.",0
"I was expecting a tee shirt, but the material is more of light sweater knit. in the end it wasn't the fabric that was the deal breaker...it was the fit. in my regular size it is too wide and boxy through the body. i also felt like the arms are too big as well. it's going back and i am not going to bother ordering it in a smaller size. it's a shame because the embroidery really is lovely.",0
"If the sweater looked as it does in the picture, i would keep it. however, it was very boxy and short, a style that does not work for me at all. i'm 5 ft. 6 in. and ordered the medium. i suspect the sweater on the model may be clipped back to make it look more form fitting. unfortunately i will have to return the sweater.",0
"I love these shorts!!! they are thin lightweight and not see through. however the reviews are correct. i am usually a size 2 or 4 in shorts. i am 5'1"" 112 pounds and i had to size up to 6.. i was able to zip the shorts up but the fit wa a little tight. the 6 offered me the comfort of more room.. overall nice shorts..",1
"I'm 5'4"", 130 lbs, curvy and fit. i'm usually a size 6 but when i tried these shorts on, they were tight. i sized up to an 8 and they looked better. but overall the fit was not flattering on a petite, curvy frame. i think these shorts would work on someone taller and a bit thinner in the thigh area.",0
"Like the previous review said, i was excited to receive this top. i had grand visions of all the ways i could wear it! to my chagrin, when i put it on, it just fell right down and pooled around my waist. i wish there were smaller sizes to order. sadly, this is going back.",0
"I love, love, love byron lars dresses. they fit my curves like a glove. but this one... i guess it would have fit me like a glove. but i live alone, and at the moment i don't have enough money to hire a lady's maid, and so i couldn't actually tell. it buttons all the way up the back, so you cannot put it on yourself, unless you are a contortionist. wanted to love this but can't.",0
"I absoluty love this dress! it hugs in all the right places, giving a sexy yet very classy look, very much a ""mad men"" look. the quality is fantastic and could easily pass for a vintage dress that has been kept safely preserved. i would recomend every lady has one of these in her closet, especially when you need to feel just a little bit prettier!",1
"This sweater is huge! i usually wear a small, ordered an extra small and i was still swimming in it. i like big sweaters, but i ended up returning it because the sizing looked ridiculous.",0
"It was bit on pricey side but it was love at first sight! i couldn't let go after i tried it on..it is soft, lightweight, moves with me, keeps me warm (not just from top up)..it feels silky to the touch and is very versatile and stylish..

runs true to size and it expands a bit the more you wear it ...",1
"It is delicate and soft. the sleeves fit great on my 5'10"", 130lb frame, but the shoulders on the size small were too tight so i am exchanging it for a medium. the lining is unusual -- the front is fully lined but the back is only lined to the shoulder blades which is somewhat noticeable on the model. i would choose to wear a cami underneath for extra coverage.",1
"I loved this the minute i saw it in the store but left without buying it.  i called the store an hour later and asked them to hold it for me so i could get it the next day. :)

i love it.  it's still a little too warm to wear it in nyc yet but i will soon. i'm thinking 40-50's is the perfect temps for it.  

i rarely say this but i don't think the photos of the coat above do it justice.",1
"Love these vintage soft jeans.. they do run small so be sure get a size larger.. i am typically a 27 and i ordered a 28... look amazing with boots, flip flops and slip ons... love mother jeans.. work every time",1
"The buttons on the back are very tedious. you will need someone to help you. if you get past that hurdle, then you have the look of a little girl in a smock. way too big. like a nightgown. nice quality, but not practical.",0
Warning-- it's totally sheer so you will need to wear a tank under it or unless you're very confident in your mid-section you can wear a bandeau or just a bra. it's definitely a lounge/ leisure wear piece and great for layering if you want to wear it out. it's lightweight and perfect layer over a simple dress or top. i live in this over the weekends. i am a larger gal-- broader shoulder and purchased an xl. it's true to size and roomy.,1
The collar on this sweater is too stiff for my taste. the color and fabric is really nice. just wish the collar was different.,0
"So bummed... i ordered this in the raspberry color then actually saw it in a store before it arrived to my house, so i tried it on. while i agree with the other reviews, it runs big in some areas, something about the neckline just wasn't right on me. it seemed to ride up higher and wasn't what i wanted. also, the ""raspberry"" color is almost more of a burnt orange. when i think of raspberry, i think of pink or red, this was neither of those. the top itself is cute though and super comfy. if it we",1
"I purchased this dress to wear to a wedding in june. i am 5'4"", 32d and 120lbs. i bought the size 2 and it fit like a glove, didn't even have to wear a bra. the quality is beautiful. the fabric, stitching and detail are top notch and well worth the price. the way the seaming hits you on the hips and but is very flattering, especially for girls who may not be that curvy. it accentuates your curves for sure. it reminds me of an old hollywood, wiggle dress. 

with that being said the dress does h",1
"I'm glad the previous reviews had mentioned the dolman sleeves so i was better prepared for how it would fit. you do have to do some rearranging of the fabric, but it generally stays put and isn't bothersome. the neckline is a bit more structured than shown in the pictures, but it only adds to a more sophisticated look. great fabric and color as well.",1
"This dress is beautiful and extremely well made... if you can get into it. the only way to close the dress is a line of difficult to button buttons up the back. it's form fitting, so you'd better be on your yoga a game or have a loved one or hand maiden to lend a hand. i thought about taking it to a tailor to install a hidden side zipper, but it's soooo form fitting i'm afraid i wouldn't wear it.",0
"Too much fabric, not a flattering top. for reference i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are 38-30-40.",0
"I love these shorts, nice material, good fitting, and great look. i sized up, usually an 8 and i ordered a 10 based on others reviews and it was the right choice. these are a great casual short or dressed up with shoes and a nice shirt.",1
I wore this coat one day and the buttons started falling off. it stretched so much. i'm going to beg my local store to take back. it shouldn't fall apart like that. it's super duper cozy though.,0
"I had to review this because i purchased before any reviews were up and now that i've received this dress i'm appalled by all the positive reviews!!! this dress is hideous in person. seriously hideous. and even if you can get past the drapery fabric, it's incredibly restricting. the picture online is so misleading. the dress isn't even an ivory it's more of a pea green! so disappointed.",0
I like this top and agree that it does run large. i find the fabric to be somewhat heavy which i consider a good thing as it will hang nicely and do a good job of hiding *imperfections*. it does have a pleat in the back which is not so apparent in the photo here. i love the neckline... a slight bit of a *v* neck.,1
These have a great fit & design. i ordered a size larger after reading that this style runs on the small size. typically i'm a 27 but ordered a 28. the wash has a great vintage feel about it! i also love that these do not lose their shape after wearing all day.,1
"I took a chance and ordered this top on sale, even after reading the troublesome reviews. this updated take on the turtleneck is a keeper for me. the purple color is vibrant and the collar lays without repeated fussing. i ordered the xs (116, 5'4"" for reference) and the fit was tts and close to, but not snug on my torso. there is room for a button down blouse underneath (as styled in a gallery pic) and i did not find the sleeves to be problematic, as it fit me close enough to the body to not giv",1
"I thought it was going to be so pretty. it is ugly on. the macrame is thick, stiff and rough. the top fits awkward on top where the macrame is and the rest is shapeless. yuk!",0
"This coat is awful, just awful. i bought it based on the reviews, my husband said it looks like i am wearing a mattress. it looked awful. i really really liked the softness and that it wasn't like another puffer coat, it was also stretchy and the buttons super easy to wear, but the look, style, and design make it very unflattering. it looked so bad that i took it off right away. so disappointing!",0
"I new i had to have this dress the moment i saw it. i am a recent convert to byron lars and have three dress of his design. they are all 6 or 6p so i felt confident ordering a 6. whoops! this dress fit perfectly up to the waist. it was even a little roomy but i couldn't button it up any further than that. it is a little weird since i always thought i had a narrow ribcage. anyway, i will have to exchange it for an 8p. and hope for the best. it really is an exquisitely beautiful dress and unbeliev",1
"I took this into the dressing room for fun and wow so glad i did! i got the regular m and it fits perfectly. it is very slightly roomy but i think thats the design and it still looks great. as a petite, the regular m fit perfectly - heals or no heals. its comfy and lovely!!!!!",1
"This tank/blouse is flowy and i love the design. it was immediately comfortable and seemed true to size. i wore it to a family event with a sweater, black leggings and boots. i'm 5'5,"" 36d and usually wear medium in retailer tops and this fit beautifully from the get go, just love it!",1
"I am currently searching for the perfect pair of white boots to go with this. this is so fun. i used to wear a lot of vintage clothes and this dress lit the fire again to start looking for cool pieces. i tried on my usual size and found that it fit pretty tts. it was a bit roomy in the hips, but considering the cut of the dress, i assume that to be intentional. for reference, i am 5'9"", 150 lbs, 36d and bought a size 8.",1
This shirt was great for one wear. after just one wash (followed instructions to dry clean) it lost all shape and now hangs like a bed sheet. terrible waste of money on a pricey top.,0
"I took a chance on this one with free shipping and figured i had nothing to lose. i love it! the bottom hem is slightly flared, but does not look like a maternity tee. i'm going to wear this with a fun scarf, skinnies and colorful flats! this tee is a must!",1
"I liked the design and the shirt did fit well enough, but the thin fabric does not justify the price. it looks like it will get holes in it after a wash or two.",0
"Here's what i liked:
great shape through body, cool empire waist. and good length
loved the color, more rust than red.
material was somewhat light which liked since i often get overheated in turtlenecks.

here's what i disliked:
the sleeves!! the reason they only show the model with her arms against her body is because the sleeves are ridiculous. they are just too big and too flowy. they will always be in the way of everything and there is no way to roll or push up.",0
"I was so bummed to see how quickly this top sold out online in the black. however, to my delight, i happened to stumble upon the shirt in my size in my local store recently. knowing it was sold out online, i immediately grabbed it to try on. big mistake: i instantly fell in love. i'm a curvy woman (34d chest, wide hips, small waist and a slight tummy) and this shirt fits beautifully in my usual size (which is a medium in deletta). hugs my figure without making me look big. i work in an office wh",1
"I ordered this in a size 4 and it is great quality. the only problem is the size of the slip. the top is very tight across my average chest, but fine elsewhere - odd fit. the dress fits great and i debated finding another slip, but ultimately decided to return it.",1
"I got this top in white and it is cute. the fabric is a weird kind of polyester, and kind of shiny. i got the medium and it pulls a little around the chest. overall i like it.",1
"This should have been cute, but the fabric choice + ruching design made me look like i had elephant skin rippling around my waist -- super unflattering.",0
"I'm 5'6'' , athletic build-thought it was cute but in the end didn't like the color of the inner sweatshirt--wish it was black or white. send it back.",0
"I agree with the other reviewer -- it's refreshing to find a top that isn't all baggy or sheer, which seems to be the current trend right now.
_______
pros:
- lots of stretch. this was so comfortable and the rayon lining inside really makes this breathable.
- the ruched detailing, sleeves and overall length is great.
- no cami needed with the white. i see in the pics on the model that appears to be cami underneath. i wrote a nude bra and didn't have an issue at the front because it's two la",1
"I'm tall (5'11"" and busty) and found this top to run on the short side. as others have said, the material is soft and stretchy, but the rouching created a bit of a bulky look. i returned it.",0
These could barely fit over my calf and did not even broach my knee. i have big calves but i am otherwise i slim and normal sized woman. these are way too tight and narrow to enjoy or to get much use out of.,0
Construction excellent. the dress was pretty big around the hip...does not have a shape like seen in the picture. the fabric was beautiful but was stiff...like furniture. the color was not as vibrant as the picture. returned.,0
"Beautiful top but it didn't fit. i am small chested with wide shoulders, normally wear a xs or s - ordered the xs and it swallowed me.",1
"Bought this shirt in mid-july, washed twice (cold, delicate) and hung to dry. already holes/falling apart",0
Like this top. it's not too thin but still remains cool. too bad it has to be hand washed.,1
"The material was a little itchy in my opinion. the fit was pretty big. almost a night shirt. i'm 5' 3"", and i will probably only wear this around the house with tights. i got a small. i purchased the orange color online. stay away if you have an olive skin tone! it's the pinkish it appears to be on be on the website. i'm 130 pounds 34d",0
This dress has gorgeous fabric and impeccable quality construction! i'm 5'4 118lbs and large busted (32. dd). i am usually an overall size 4 but when buying dresses usually have to purchase a six to accommodate my chest. i ordered a size 4 because that was the only size left and was going to take a chance . it fit perfect across the chest but the overall dress is enormous! does not even slightly silhouette your figure. it is like a giant stiff triangle. i was going to return but was so hesitant,1
I run between an xs and s in most retailer shirts. i went with the xs in this one and was glad i did. the fit is lovely and flattering. i loved this shirt the second i put it on -- then went to order it in another color.,1
"I love this top and wear it all the time. it's a gorgeous pale blue and feels amazing....it is a tighter fitting shirt so if you like looser clothes, size up",1
"Very flattering, the material is not the softest but it's an easy one to throw on with jeans",1
I loved the shirt until i washed it! awful fabric quality. cheaply made.,0
"So i really loved this dress. i am tall (6ft) and the size 8 was perfect length. i would have worn it with flat dressy sandals. i would say it is true to size. i am not a flowy dress kind of girl but this was just the perfect amount of ""flow"" without making me feel like i was wearing a long potato sack. the back is just gorgeous and unique. here is why i couldn't make it mine. the tube top part is completely detachable and extremely thin. there is literally not much to it and i'm not sure it wou",0
Bought this early in the season - probably washed and worn <8 times and there are small holes that have formed in the front towards the bottom...bummer!,0
"I originally bought this for myself but it was way too big on my backside since i don't have much ""junk in the trunk."" i decided to pass it on to my sister since it was just too pretty to return. it fits her much better and she's worn it on a few occasions. it does run larger and the pants are very long. definitely have to be either hemmed or always worn with heels.",1
"It's an adorable take on the ""casual"" sweatshirt. i love the layers, but i wish they were just a little different. they hang a little strange. perhaps if the bottom one was a smidge longer? i'm not sure. or if the sweatshirt layer was a little longer and the blouse bit was therefore longer. it all hangs just a little...off? but, it's not so off that it looks bad. i'm petite, so it's cute on, but, i think if you were tall, it might hang a little weird. a warning though, i ordered a small, and the",1
I had high hopes for this top but it was too big and too much fabric.,0
"Really cute version of a sweatshirt. fits true to size through the shoulders and bust line; however, since i am larger in the bust area than the hip, the lower half of the top looks slightly large on my body. the sweatshirt is cut very straight, so it would probably flatter a person with a pear or straight shape. the inside material of the sweatshirt is a little rough; however, the appliquã© design makes this shirt a keeper.",1
"I ordered this in size xl and it ran small. i'm a pear-shape and thought this style would be flattering. i have a few other peplum-style sweatshirts from retailer that are my favorites. but, the cut on this is tighter so the bottom layers gap and don't flow well. i found it to run short too. it's cut one size too small. i would have sized up but, being xl, there's no option for that. i'm returning mine.

the applique is done well and is cute. the colors look the same in person.",0
"I read the reviews before i bought this dress and had trouble believing that the dress literally fell apart at the seams so i bought it. first the good: i love the color, the fabric, and the design. it's very lightweight and loose-fitting and is perfect for hot days. the neck and sleeves are pretty on. i can wear it as a cover up or put on a necklace and sandals for everyday errands and things.
now the bad: it literally falls apart at the seams as you take it out of the package! i""m surprised a",0
"I love this tunic. i am typically an xxs petite, so i should have known that the regular xs would be too large, but i took a chance on it. unfortunately it was, in fact, much too large. it is too bad because i absolutely love it. the fabric is soooo soft and comfy. i ordered it in the blue, and it is prettier than pictured. this is a great dress for the beach or pool-side or just knocking around. if you live in a hot climate or take warm-weather vacations, i highly recommend this. it takes up ve",1
"This is one of those dresses that might be better for those under 40. on me, the fullness of the pleats and the bell sleeve made me feel like i was wearing one of those dresses for a much older lady. i miss not having to consider those things. the red color is lovely and the dress is modest. i just think it will read a lot better on a younger chiquita.",1
"This is an adorable piece but the fit is a gamble. the crotch hung way too low for comfort on these so since i got a great sale price, i had them altered. i haven't worn them yet but i'm sure i'll get compliments when i do. so if you want to take chance on the fit and/or alter them, go for it!",0
I ordered a size smaller prr other reviewers but that still didn't prepare me for the sweater's issues. it looks really cute but the quality is pretty horrendous. i wore it for the first time today and already the sweater is pilling a lot on my back. seriously heartbroken.,0
"I love this dress. the fit is spectacular and if there were any problems with the hook and eyes in the front coming undone as stated in previous reviews, it has been corrected! the dress does not come undone and it moves beautifully with you walking, sitting and bending. i wore this to a holiday party and the color is just amazing! a coppery and brown/gold pattern. very flattering! i will purchase more byron lars dresses for certain!",1
"I thought this dress was beautiful and the quality is amazing. i thought it was going to be black and gold, but it has a lot of brown in it as well. i ordered a petite. i'm 5'61/2"" and the petite was just above my knees whereas the regular came below my knees. this is a dress i can wear to many events.",1
"I received this yesterday and the fit for me is so strange...to tight in the bust and the arms were to big for me..i am so bummed...the arms do not stay on my shoulders. i have many tops but maeve and they fit me well..this is the first one i have to return. this top is made well and i do recommend, but it should be tried on before purchasing as it is pricey if it does not fit you!",1
I ordered a size 12 and it was huge on me! very loose fitting dress. i didn't like the material either.,0
"I didn't want to get the black carissima because i already own the mona, so when i saw this gorgeous marguerite for sale, i had to bite. the main colors are chocolate brown, copper and rose pink--such a beautiful combination. the hook",1
"Fits like a glove and looks amazing on. it fits so many different body types but yet is flattering in all the right places! i got 00p and have a smaller chest and hip but it really gives a nice shape! got compliments all night when i wore this to a formal dance, but i could see myself wearing this again and again for holiday parties or other occasions!",1
"I'm disappointed in these pants, which looked so beautiful online and even have pockets! in person the pattern and colors aren't as nice, the fabric is too thin, and the pants look cheap. the pockets are pretty shallow. the fit isn't good either. i ordered up (i'm between sizes) and they're still not as flowy as i'd have liked. these are too pricy as lounge pants for me to be on the fence about them, so they're going back. if you buy them knowing about the thin fabric and snug fit, they might wo",0
"I bought this is the orange/red motif and it is a beautiful print, although in person it is a more rich reddish color than the washed out model image. the entire shirt is sheer, so i will need to wear something under, but that doesn't bother me. i have a small chest (34a) and find that the front of the shirt is noticeably longer than the back, but that wouldn't be an issue if i was a little better endowed. this looks gorgeous with black pants and a blazer. not sure that it is worth full price, b",1
"I was intrigued by the pattern of this blouse (the purple version) but the design is terrible for me. it's boxy, i didn't like the fabric, and the arm ruffles are bizarre. it's going back tomorrow.",0
This is such a cute top. perfect for fall layered with a sweater!,1
"I was excited to receive in hopes to wear more as a tunic over skinnies vs a dress for fall. this runs sooo very large. the material is thick, and the pattern is just ok. didn't do anything for my hourglass shape. returned.",0
"I bought this dress because it looked sooo comfy. and it is! the fabric feels nice and it fits loose without feeling like a burlap sack. it's perfect for running around town for errands. i actually didn't think my boyfriend would like it because he generally likes more form-fitting pieces (yes, big surprise) but he actually commented out of the blue that it's really sexy. comfy *and* sexy?! score!",1
"Loved the fabric but returning because the armholes are cut waaaaay too low. unless you have 30"" arms, all you get is an unnecessary showing of your bra",0
"I bought the s; came with a tag saying ""sz 8"". it is in fact more like a size 2, if not 0. 

the bust is probably a 34 a or b, or 32a or b - the cups fit me relatively well, but the rest was so tight that i could barely manage to put put it in. i can't imagine wrestling with this bathing suit each time i want to wear it, so i will return it. 

the fabric, design is as spectacular as it looks though... very good quality.",0
"5'7"", 34c, 28 jeans, 4 dress. ordered a small and a medium. never tried on the medium. the small was a little big in the waist, but what threw me for a loop was the chest. huge! could work if it's meant to be blousey, but the armholes were massive. if an xs is returned, i might give it a shot. but i can't imagine what women who are smaller than me are going to do in this jumpsuit. great color, transitions into fall easily. cannot be belted or wear a camisole due to the opening at the stomach. sh",0
"These pants are more like 9"" not 10"". i was very dissappointed. the color is great and so is the fabric.
if you look more closely at the model the pants don't fit her either!! they are too small! i haven't decided whether or not to take them back because i am losing weight. i am a 31 so far but these pants are like a 30. i need the color because they go perfectly with a top i bought from retailer",0

"I ordered this cardigan on sale and it was a wonderful fit and color. just the light sort of cute pullover i was looking for to keep and wear at work. unfortunately, it is poorly made. i wore it once and it already started to fray and fall apart. after closely inspecting the cause, i realized that the threads in the sweater are not fully sewed together, so the minute you put it on, one will start to unravel leading to a domino effect. it is a shame because the design and cut were truly a great f",0
"The top is a pretty and has a nice pattern. it does run large and is it a bit billowy. i am 5'4 petite and ordered a small ( maybe the xs would have been better). however, the top swallowed me up and was unflattering. the colors are true to the picture..not very bright, but would be a nice transition to fall top.
the feel of the blouse was nice and maybe if i was taller and ordered a smaller size it would have been better.",1
"I like this! the fabric is soft and a little less orange-looking than in the photo. i'm usually a size 12 or 14 and the size l is very small on me - as in i'd have to lose a little weight for it to look normal on me. also, it's a bit annoying that you have to undo all the little buttons in the bodice to get it on and off when going to the bathroom. but otherwise it looks cute and even has pockets!",1
"The dress fit fine, with two exceptions. first, i am 5'1"", and i ordered a petite 4. the dress was dragging on the ground, so it would need hemming if i were keeping it. but the deal breaker was that the gathering of the outer fabric over the bust stuck out an inch beyond my 34d figure, which made me look like i had very oddly shaped nipples. i made the assumption that the dress i received was defective, so sent it back, but unfortunately, the replacement fit the same way. the lining fabric fit",0
"Really flattering cut, this shirt is perfect for fall. got so many compliments the first time i wore it!",1
"Sadly, i returned this one. i'm a 36d bra size and this shirt could not handle that. it fit around my chest, so sizing up was not necessary, but my chest caused the straps to shift and sit funny on my shoulders. cute top and well made for those who can fit into it better!",0
"Gorgeous wide leg sweats. i did wear them outside but i wore with a long t because they are slightly see through if they are snug on your bum. they don't seem like they will last long because they are thin. but the cut is adorable and very flattering. they were a gift, not sure i would have spent $78 but i do love them.",1
"This dress runs a little smaller than most maeve dresses, but it is so cute. i still ended up getting my regular size 6, but will need to wear spanx with it to get a smoother line. nice material, and great color. the store had just gotten it in when i bought it, and everyone who saw it was raving over it.",1

"This dress had an odd fit. very loose on top with pointy darts, very tight on bottom. fabric was stiff so it didn't move well with me",0
"Loved the bright pattern online and had hoped it had a similar fit to the tyla ts which i love. in actuality this was a lot boxier. the cut was shorter in length, too short for my 5'10 frame. the width was rather boxy and unflattering, particularly with the wide arm holes and flat cuffed sleeves. also the pattern looked a little cheap in person, way less spectacular than retailers typical gorgeous vibrant patterns. this is going back i'm afraid.",0
"Fun, sexy underwear but rides up in the front. will return",0
"Designs are nice and texture feels comfortable, but sleeves are odd because they are angled.
i wonder what i should do to look cool in this t-shirt.
i tried wearing neutral motif, but i still felt odd.
also, width is relatively wide, so it runs large.

not sure if it's the zipper that pulls the fabric or if there's just too much fabric in the back but the back of the bodice doesn't lie flat",0
Gosh this is beautiful but it is way wider and puffer than i imagined it would be. in fact it almost looks like a costume or something you would buy handmade. i would just feel silly wearing this out to dinner with a group of friends. i gave it high ratings on the quality however because it really is beautiful but the design is just not what i had hoped for.,0
"I ordered this dress in my usual sz 2 it seemed to be tight on the hips , then i tried the next sz 4 and it was tight because ,i realized that the lining was very sticky, and would bunch up underneath making the dress look defective on me, not for curvy on bottom. i think if you are more slim down below this will maybe work but i had to return for this reason. i was considering cutting out the lining because it was so cute, and i really liked the look of the dress, if it goes on sale i may purch",0

I'm so in love with these pants. they are so flattering and made of thick material. they do run a bit large though so i'd suggest you size down. i also like they they're high waisted. the gold button details are gorgeous as well. great pair of pants.,1
"Generally, i find sizing at retailer to be very consistent, so i ordered this dress in the same size that i order all of my other retailer dresses. the bust was way to small. so i had to go and return this and have the next size up shipped to me. it's till way too small! in addition, the shipping was terrible - the dress was just dumped into a bag with no attempt to fold this, and the right strap was defective! it's so irritating that i have to return this again!",0
"This vibrant colors in this dress are beautiful, but the fit is very off. you would assume a fit like this would be slimming and flattering at the waist but it somehow squished down my boobs, and made my waist look wide. it also ran small.",0
"While the cut, drape, and shape of this dress are very attractive, seeing the fabric in person was disappointing to me. it's clearly well-made and there are abundant high-quality details. however, the combination of a large-ish pattern and the wrinkly, thin cotton still felt kind of limp and cheap. i sent it back.",1

"I got the dress with the boat pattern- such a fun dress and very flattering. it is definitely a coral, but i am able to wear this with my fair skin and will probably look better with some color as spring/summer finally arrive. i am only 5""2' so the length is great for me- i can wear this to work, but it would be pretty short for a tall gal. definitely recommend!",1

"I was able to try this on in store thanks to a return. it is a cool looking item and i thought the fit and aesthetic were spot on but the price made me leave it behind. even on sale, i this wasn't worth the price for me- the high-low hem and material combined exclude it as a work option for me. if this is something you can get mileage out of, i really do recommend it- well made, lovely colors, and nice style.",1

"Looks really nice on teh pictures. i tried on thre cream as this was the only color availalbe at my store (tried on per stylist recommendation(. it is very thin, you can see ripples from my belly lol, but still fairly flattering. i ended up purchasing, but it is in my maybe pile for now... wil lwait before wearing it to be sure. can't wear a grey bar with it, that htin...",1
"This skirt is a great staple. i somewhat agree with the first reviewer that it is a little big but not huge. i bought a m which is my regular size and i have to have it shorten the length, but that is typical for me since i am very short, but i liked the waist and didn't feel like it was too big and i have a very small waist. i don't like tight elastic at the waist and this sat very comfortably on me. nice heavy material for the winter.",1
"So happy with this top. i love the fabric, the colors and the flowy fit!  definitely recommend!",1
"I'm not much for ponchos, but this one looked unique. it is thin, kind of a felt material - that was expected - but i was surprised to find it was shorter at waist than how it appears online,, and it was wide horizontally. the colors were more muted and the design was slightly off center unlike pic. the turtleneck was thick and itchy. it was a return.",0
"Like the other reviewer, i was super lucky to find this dress at my local stores. i tried both the medium and the small. usually at retailer, i wear a medium. however, this dress in a medium did not look flattering on me. it hung off my shoulders and the material was too loose in between the velvet tiers, making my bottom look bumpy. when i tried on the small, the dress fit and flattered me perfectly! by far the best dress i ever owned. i truly recommend you try this dress on before purchasing. fo",1
"I definitely like unique things, but the sleeves are way too much on this sweater.  it's a shame because it is so soft and comfortable, but overall i felt it looked somewhat silly on me.",0
"The fit was not flattering at all, but the worst part was the colors were really dull and not bright as shown in the online photos.",0
Not sure what to think! i had great plans for this dress,0
"Love the top design, not so much the fabric. i should've read the top was 100% polyester. returning and finding a better quality top.",0
"Unfortunately the dress is pulling apart after the first wash ( gentle hand wash cycle). also, there are no bra-straps holders, and my bra straps did show up a lot...",0
"I was so excited to get this top... and while it is soooo amazingly soft, i still could not keep it. i must admit that i am only 5'2"", so i do think this had quite a bit to do with my dislike of this... but i felt like a matador, which is definitely not what i was going for... maybe if your tall and lean, this would work.  but for me, no way.",0
I would have l loved to keep it but even the 0p was big. i have pretty broad muscular shoulders and back and i was swimming it. i wish retailer would stock more petites. i would repurchase if the 00p was available.  they always sell out very very quickly and they never restock.,0
"I agree with the other reviewer about the great colors, but when i took this off the rack to try one, you can see through both layers of fabric. i thought, insulting quality, for the price. i imagine the holes would start after one wearing.",0
"I have vowed to only purchase high-waisted bottoms from here on out because they are just more in line with my style! these shorts did not disappoint. i love that they're versatile enough to wear with a cute top + wedges or with a t-shirt and flats. great find! (i got my normal sz. 25 which is usually a tight fit, these zipped up perfectly though!)",1
"I couldn't wait to try this dress on when i first saw it featured. it is stunning! i love the red lace over-layed with a blue slip. it adds a fun color contrast to the piece. i am usually a size 6 in retailer clothing and found this one comfortably true to size. this dress has a very renaissance chic quality which is very feminine, flirty and unique. a great find for fall/winter parties. i can't wait to wear it!

if i had to find a fault with this dress, it's the lack of pockets. retailer d",1
"It is a very pretty bra. light weight and beautiful lace. however, i have yet to find a t-back that does not make me feel like i am going to spill out. to me it ran small. i now know to get a 34 instead. i am working on losing weight, perhaps that might help with the fit?",1
"I waited impatiently for this item to come in stock, and when it did, i had it overnighted because i was so excited to receive it. it's hit or miss with me as far as retailer's mediums and larges, depending on the brand. i generally err on the side of caution, so i ordered the large. it looked cute out of the package, but when i put it on i was terribly disappointed. it flared way out at the bottom, and was not as fitted through the waist as on the model. this could have been the large sizing, but",0
This is so flowing and perfect to hide any flaws.i adore it!,1
"I love the pattern adn color combo, but, wow,t really flatering on me. too much fabric. i felt like i was trying to hide wight gain or pregnancy or wearing a mumu. anyway, not for me, but others might toll wnat to try in case it was just me... too bad.

length was decent in regulat size though, not too long. just too wide.",0
"This is an adorable top, but it just wasn't my style. i'm 40 and felt silly wearing a big bow, but if you can rock this look i'd recommend it. the top is a thin sweatshirt material, not a knit sweater or a thick sweatshirt fabric. it is a cotton rayon blend. the sweatshirt part is cropped, but the striped shirt details come to a good length. the shirt trim is 100% cotton. the fit was true to size. it is a bit loose, not overly fitted, but true to size. it nips in a bit at the waist and then flar",0
This runs very small and has a beautiful design but it feels very cheap. material feels like thinnest possible t-shirt material out there. surprised with retailer on this one. back home to retailer it goes!,0
"I bought the denim ch rocket high-rise crop last spring and had so much fun wearing them that i had to scoop up these babys when i saw black!! same fantastic fit only i had to size up so i assuming they run small in black? i could sleep in these they are this comfy and so flattering! i've got a flat behind and the placement of the pockets really give that lift i need in back! i'd buy one in every color if i could, so worth that price tag!!!",1
"I was so excited to get this top! i love the bow at the neck and the frill sleeves, so current. unfortunately, it was difficult for me to pull it over my head! the neck opening is too small, and there are no buttons. i have a pretty small head and very fine straight hair, so i can imagine that others will have a similar issue getting it on!

i am keeping it because i love the style, but will need to alter the neck myself. the rest of the top fits just a bit loose.
i got the x-small and am a 3",0
"I own many of the natori feathers back close bras and decided to try the front close version for spring/summer tops and dresses. i purchased the yellow and got the matching hipsters panty. i no longer see the yellow available but you could find elsewhere or maybe retailer will bring this color back (it is lovely!)? for sizing, i tried my normal size (34b) and the cup size larger per other reviews. the 34c did end up fitting better so i also recommend going up a cup size. excited for warmer weather",1
"Beautiful floral print and while i like the concept of this dress it was a total failure for me. where the knit meets the print hit me at the top of my bust, truly a disastrous look for a bustier figure since the fabric just drapes down and made me look much larger than i actually am. same with the arms, if the white knit had carried down to the elbow it would have elongated the arms instead of cutting them off mid biceps to make them look like giant hams. i'm 5'6"" and a classic size 8 and this",0
"I loved the colors of this vibrant dress. the beading is fabulous. the dress does run small, i sized up one size. i wore it out and got a lot of compliments",1
"As a mom, items in my wardrobe that are easy to throw on in a flash, comfortable to run around in with my kids, and still look like i took some time putting together my outfit are priceless. these fit the bill on all counts. they look fantastic with a pair of booties and a light, flowing top.

these have to be the most comfortable joggers ever made.",1
"I wanted to love this top, but had 2 major problems with it. first, it's not for short girls. i'm only 5' tall and it was a total mess on me proportion wise. the sleeves were way too long and the seam where the sweater and peplum meet hit right in the middle of my butt, which was terribly unflattering. second, the grey fabric was very thin and kinda cheap looking. no regrets on returning this one.",0
"I loved this top so much that i ended up purchasing it in another color. it works with so many different outfits, both casual and dressy. it is super comfortable and so soft. i would definitely recommend it!",1
"It's a beautiful top, but not for the price. very thin material (not see-through though), i fear it may easily rip.",0
"I fell in love with this top when i saw it online. i love tracy reese! the pattern is beautiful and the yellow is even brighter in person. i ordered a size small even though i normally wear an xs in all tops. for whatever reason, there was no xs offered, which is odd. the straps are adjustable which is good but unfortunately you absolutely cannot wear this top without fashion tape to keep the straps from falling off your shoulders. the straps slipped off my shoulders constantly. i wore a coobie",1
Material is strange. triangle top is funky. this is just not awesome in any way.,0
"This is such a cute design, but it's so short! it barely hits at my hips. you'd have to wear a layer under it to keep your tummy from being exposed. i'm also not thrilled with the buttons - i am a 34c bra size and the second button was gaping open on the size 4 top. i wish they'd been sewn shut - the neckline is so big, it's not like the buttons need to function. i got the burgundy with pink flowers and the colors are great. too bad it's so short and gapes open at the bust. going back.",0
"I purchased this top in the xs and was so excited to receive it as i love the layered look snd the back of the sweater was so cute online! the sweater itself is lovely, but it was a tent on me! waaaaay too big for my 5'3"" frame. if you're a taller gal or someone who likes more volume in their swing tops, this is for you. unfortunately, i had to return it.",0
"I rarely buy anything at full price at retailer. but, after trying this dress on last weekend i had to buy it because i couldn't handle the thought of not having this dress in my life! i'm 5 feet tall and a size 12, so this was definitely a maxi on me. but, there is just enough room at the bottom that i can safely wear it with flats. i'm very pear-shaped and this dress is extremely flattering on me. even my husband agreed that i needed to buy it even though he hates my shopping/clothing add",1
"I'm a big fan of maeve products. still, even when i like something, i always prefer to try on in the store just to be certain. i decided to risk it this time and was so happy when this top came and it fit perfectly. i'm 5'3, 150 lbs but carry more weight on bottom so i ordered the 8. it's just right--cute and flowy. i'll probably get another one in a different color!",1
"I got this in the green blue pink motif and i love it. really nice flow and not tent like at all. 5'8, 135, and in a size 6 i don't find this shows my stomach at all. it's really comfortable and i love the colors. i did get this in store at 15% off and i think it's a little pricy for a rayon shirt without the discount.",1
"This is such a cute summer tank to wear with capris or shorts. it is loose fitting and while i normally prefer the petite sizing at 5'1, i got the 00 since i liked the longer length. i purchased the wine and navy colors and the neckline isn't too deep at all. love it!",1
"Love this sweater. one of my favorite fall purchases by far. love how it hangs - especially the low back. it's simple, comfortable yet so chic at the same time. i bought the grey and goes great with skinny jeans and boots.",1
Perfect fall accessory and transitional piece for cooler days. classic red and black check with a fashion flair. great with jeans or dress it up with jewelry. a great find!,1
"I was hesitant to order these especially because they didn't have a petite since there's shipping and i thought i might have to return them. i know that most shorts from retailer run a little big (i'm usually a 4 but in retailer bottoms 0-2). i ordered the 2 regular since there were no petites. they're not too high waisted (i think they could have gone higher) but they're not low, either. love them. they're so fun and i can't wait to break them out.",1
I agree with the other reviewers - the fabric is beautiful - although i wish they would start making blouses again that didn't require you to wear a cami underneath because of sheerness. i mean for the price shouldn't it be lined or something. when did our expectations on fabric quality get so low. but i knew going in that it would be sheer so i can't really complain too much. plus they are so loosely sewn on that after 20 minutes and only half the buttons undone one fell off. i gave up at that,0
"I love the design of this cape. most capes are coats which can only be wore in the fall months here in the midwest since winter is too cold. this cape is more like a layering piece for indoors similar to a cardigan sweater, which i like. it can be wore in an office setting or out on the town with jeans. the constructions is well made as well",1
"For a blouse this beautiful and whimsical, i just can't understand why the little button loops would need to be constructed to maintain security on fort knox. i patiently worked my way through the gauntlet of them because i was determined to try it on, but ultimately, i can't see doing this again for a pricey top that shouldn't require hard labor to access. the fabric is perfect; a beautiful cotton lawn without any sheen, which really brings out the contrast of colors. it is slightly see through",1
"This dress didn't work for me at all. i'm 6ft tall, 160lb, i usually wear size l 8/10, but based on the reviews i ordered an m. the material of this dress is very soft and fuzzy, color is about the same as pictured, also length is appropriate. dress is very thick and warm, the fabric however has no stretch at all, dress is very specious and shapeless. there is allot of room everywhere except shoulders & sleeves, i thought that area was tight & snug which is strange because it runs large everywhe",0
Loved the pattern and colors of this dress. the material was extremely heavy. the shoulders and across the back was very small so that i couldn't lift my arms or put them out straight in front of me. but then the rest of the dress was huge and shapeless. sadly i had to return it.,0
"So, ordered online. tried this on, boyfriend asked me if i was buying maternity clothes. 
back it goes. super cute but huge.",0
Way too big and had a granny like styling. was very excited but ultimately took it back.,0
I bought this shirt because the reviews convinced me to. i bought it in the blue color and it's really cute. the design on the sleeves is also great and the back of the shirt looks cute too!,1
I have this top in both the green and blue and live them both. the back of this top is so cute and makes the whole top.the embroidery  is cute too.,1
"The fabric design of these shorts is so great. i don't adore the fit, they are a little short waisted for my long torso and the leg openings flare out more than i prefer and are about 1/2-1 inch longer than i would like but i can fix the inseam issue by hemming them. i may still pick them up just because i love the fabric so much.",1
"I love this little vest! such an easy outfit completer. just throw it on over jeans and a tank or long sleeves and voila...effortlessly chic! the colors pop and it's the perfect length. if you're on the fence with this one, definitely give it a try. you won't be disappointed!",1
"This is the first thing i saw when i walked into retailer and immediately snagged it. it is so flattering and true to size. pretty colors, unusual styling. there is nothing about this beauty that i don't like!",1
"I saw this at my retailer store and hesitated to try it on as it looked so long. i'm only 5'1"", so it goes to above my ankles. it's like a midi dress on me, but i really love it! it is so flattering. there is a inner lining that smoothes out anything you don't want to show. it's the usual bailey 44 great quality. so slimming! hugs the booty in the right way! definitely worth the money!",1
"This top is absolutely beautiful. the fabric is great, the cut is nice, etc... however, the buttons are too big for the button loops, which do not have any stretch. it took ten minutes to open the shirt to try it on. once i had it on, i left it unbuttoned. i returned it. (if you can't live without it, you could put smaller buttons on it.) too pricey for a non-functioning top. too bad.",0
I was wavering on this post purchase but then decided to wear it to a store opening event and double digit people asked me where i got it or commented that they liked it. i guess i made the right decision! the inside is a super soft gray jersey knit. wears great with black.,1
A serious joke. i struggled with the buttons for a good 10 minutes and gave up after the 3rd button. i'm not sure what they were thinking.,0
"I loved the lavender color on the cape. it was soft and comfortable. but the design on the front ruined it for me. it took me all of 1 minute to know it was going back. it looked like florescent bird feathers nothing wrong with that, it just wasn't my style at all. i was a bit disappointed as it would have been perfect for cool ca nights. it looked more subdued in the photo, it's not. i clicked i would recommend to others as it is nicely made and i guess just not my taste as far as the colors an",1
"I am absolutely shocked that so many people love this dress. maybe i should have sized up and reconsidered, but i still don't think it would have worked. the fabric is very soft but that's where it's qualities, for me, ended. the knot felt huge to me and definitely added unnecessary size to my already curvy hips. (for reference i'm 5'4"" and 125, hourglass. 32dd .) the cut at the bottom also felt very strange and restrictive to me, like i would have had to take smaller steps to walk around in it.",0
"I had a few pairs of these high-waisted beauties last year and love them so i was thrilled to see them in this adorable pattern which is even cuter in person. unfortunately, the cut is different. the sides, covered here by the model's hands, flare out a bit which is the function of the sectioning that the piping accentuates. the top is not the definitively high-wasted height from last year. i don't own anything else high-wasted, being an apple i'm generally a low-rider owing to a small hips/butt",0
This looked nothing like the picture on me. was long and very unflattering. belled out greatly at the bottom also. the material was thick which is why i give it three starts for quality. but overall awkward.,0
I love this dress. very comfortable. soft? absolutely!,1
"I was sorry to miss the original offering of this dress when it went on sale, so i jumped and ordered the gray/blue/green/black stripes when offered. i purchase almost all of my retailer clothes online, the dresses i am interested in are not generally offered in my local store, so there is always that moment of truth when i get to find out if something i fell in love with actually works for me... as everyone else has said, this dress is fabulous! i got my usual size 10. i am 5'5, small busted and",1
I never write reviews and i do a ton of online shopping but i had to write how amazing this dress is. so happy with this purchase. totally worth every penny! it fits like a dream- the rouching on the side is so pretty and i love the full coverage at the top. such he pretty colors too. perfect dress!!!,1
"I have athletic calves from running, so i really struggle with straight/skinny jeans. but these fit me just fine (and don't look like jeggings). i think the slit helps. i have a 29"" inseam and these hit just above the ankle. great find - especially on sale.",1
"This dress does indeed run large like the other reviewers mentioned, but it also runs small in the shoulders. i'm 5'3"" and usually a size 6. the xs fit perfectly in the body, but was a little too small in the shoulders. i liked the dress enough to size up to a small to fit the shoulders, and then just had the sides taken in slightly. i did purchase this dress during the 20% off sale, so that helped justify the cost of alterations.",1
"I like my clothes loose fitting but even for me this ran large, i am 5'7 134b and medium fit in the shoulders but was too big overall",0
"This is a thick material, but it is also airy. i got the white and don't have to worry about it being see through. it is a little boxy, but the hem hits a good length and doesn't bother me. really great for work in the summer and going between really hot and really cold temperatures. a good basic piece that can be dressed up or down that is definitely worth getting.",1
"It's soft and feels nice on skin.
true to size and fits just fine. more form fitting than model picture.",1
"Although i love retailer, this product isn't the quality or presentation i expect from them. the dress arrived stuffed into a small plastic bag and was a crumpled mess. the fabric wasn't soft and fluid as i expected, but rather was stiff and a little scratchy. i purchased the ecru version, which was also slightly darker than the photo showed. i returned the dress and will keep looking.",0
"I'm thrilled with this purchase, and looking forward to spending many years with this classic. on the subject of fit; i generally wear size medium for tops, but my broad shoulders occasionally have me in larges. since the thick-textured fabric is mostly cotton and minimal stretch (with a mix of linen), the larger size will provide more room and comfort. i'm honoring my ""tts"" choice for folks who prefer a more ""fitted"" look. overall this piece wears well!!",1
Love this shirt! so comfortable and the style is really flattering.,1
"I bought this top on sale in the store and immediately came home and ordered it in another color online. i love the length even in the xs which isn't always the case. i am 5'9"" and a size 2 and the xs fits me perfect even after washing and drying a couple times. looks cute under sweaters and vests. can wear all year round. lightweight and good neckline.",1
"I purchased the green dress in medium. i usually wear a medium. the fabric is pretty. shoulders fit nicely. sleeves were short in an odd length, but that is indeed pictured accurately. the body of the dress is very shapeless, billowy and wide, which made this appear far more like a nightgown than the photo shown. i considered altering the garment, by sewing in the sides from the armpit downward, but i decided to return the dress.",0
Love this dress! the color is gorgeous! what you don't see until you see the dress in person is the beautiful detail of the stitched flowers on the dress. i received so many compliments when i wore this dress. the sleeves are sheer and the material light weight. you can wear this dress year round. i love these kind of dresses! retailer knows how to do this right! love this store!,1
"I ordered this dress in the green ,and i love it. it does run a little large so i went down one size, which was ok by me!! it is super cute!!",1
This whole order was disappointing. the main piece i ordered was cancelled and the two remaining items - this sweater included were poorly made. there was a snag/thread hanging out in the middle of the front of the sweater - tried to tuck it in but it wouldn't stay so i'll be returning it.,0
This sweater is thick and does cover the bra well. i did not find it to be well made. the ribbing seemed to be attached loosely in places. i am a size large with a b cup and a bit thicker through the middle to my middle age dismay. putting this sweater on in coral made me feel like a giant peach. for those with larger breasts it is likely more flattering.,0
"It seems like most people love this tee, so you might as well. i returned it because i didn't like how the front hung. if the front was as long as the back, i would have kept it. or, if the front was short enough to wear with thick pants, untucked, i might have kept it (seems like this top would only look good with leggings or skirts). i do like the material, though. it's very thin and looks great in the shoulder and neck area. and i liked how the back of the shirt looked when i tried wearing it",0
"I ordered the ivory of this dress, expecting it to be a nice dress i could wear into my second trimester of pregnancy. instead, i received a dress that looks like a ugly, vintage-gone-wrong curtain of fabric. the 'ivory' is the color of yellowed newspapers. the fabric was cheap and had thread pieces sticking up all over the place. i would've been better off sewing myself a dress out of drapes a la gone with the wind or sound of music. the fit isn't that great, either. big and boxy. it could acco",0
"I saw this dress online and immediately fell in love with the bow design. purchased my typical size 4 but found it way too tight. i went to my local retailer to exchange it for the size 6. unfortunately, even the size 6 just did not fit right. moving around in the dress was challenging; the slightest shoulder/arm movement made the dress ride up. i was constantly pulling it down. the fabric is also quite stiff and heavy. overall, it's a cute dress but just not for me.",0
"The material is horrible, it's heavy and cheap. the skirt does not ""flow"" as it appears in the photo. instead the bottom part of the skirt just stands out like ruffles. am returning.",0
"The color on this dress is absolutely gorgeous, the fabric is great, and the bow detail in the back makes the dress much more interesting. i also quite liked the length. (i'm 5' 5"" and weigh about 132 and bought a 6 regular, which came to a couple of inches above my knee....not as short as it looks on the model.) overall style and aesthetic, i love. 

the problem with this dress is the fit. i tried it on in the store, starting with an 8. too big, no problem. tried the 6, still a bit large (gap",1
"I purchased the dress with the bow-back shift in peach because i loved it's nautical theme pattern.  when i recurve do the dress, i found it to be stiff and boxy.  being a petite, short-waisted person, the top portion of the stress hung on my body awkwardly.  my bra strap was showing in the back, and the dress needed to be pulled up about 2 inches to properly sit on my frame.  
i returned the dress",0
"The design of this dress is very cute, but if you have an average to large bust, don't even think about it. returned, unfortunately.",0
"I loved this dress and after i got it on. as others mentioned, it is difficult to get it on. i wish that the bow snapped on and off. as i took the dress off the bow came off itself. unfortunately going to be returning the dress.",0
"I really like this top! it's lightweight, great quality, and i've worn it for casual weekend outings and also dressed up for work.",1
"As soon as i saw this dress, i absolutely fell in love with it. when i got it, i noticed it was slightly small, but figured i could deal with it. i was packing for my vacation and tried it on again just last night and i noticed the bow is coming off the back. i could fix it, but honestly a dress shouldn't start falling apart before you even wear it. it's cut on the small side. wish i tried the larger one, but now it's sold out. and i was kind of disappointed there were no pockets as pictured. i",0
"I've rarely met a maeve item i didnt like. initially looking at this dress i thought it was suede but it's a structured cotton, making it a little more stiff than i'd like. i feel that making it suede would've been perfect for this dress. i am 5'2 140 lbs. usually a 4-6, i tried on the 6 and it was a great fit except for the chest area (34d) and the butt/hips area, making this dress a little less shift and a little baggy in the abdominal region. i then tried on the 8 and it was way too big all a",0
"I was hoping to wear this dress for an engagement photoshoot but it fit terribly. i'm 5'0, 98 lbs, 32a, and have some hips/butt. this dress (ordered xxs petite) hugged my hip/butt region tightly, which made the dress ride up and balloon out around my stomach and back. there was also too much extra room in the chest, so sizing up was out of the question. there is just way too much fabric and it's very stiff with no drape or shape whatsoever. i felt like i was wearing a cardboard box. the sleeves",1
On a hot summer 90 degree day the blue ink on the dress stained the dress and my new tory burch bag. i would never have expected that the blue print would bleed all over me and my new dress. great dress and such a wonderful fit...too bad its unwearable now.,0
"I'm a consistent size 6 (ordered a small) with a pretty athletic build (wide shoulders and strong arms) and this dress simply did not fit with those proportions. the sleeves and back were far too tight. additionally, the bow did not cover my bra strap, likely because it isn't made for someone my height. had to return.",0
"I was disappointed that this dress had no pockets, as every picture on this website suggests. otherwise, it is a great color and shape. still sad though...",1
"I love the design of this dress, but found it to be an odd fit. the bow in back didn't cover my bra, and in fact, though the overall fit seemed right, the bust was tight unless i removed the bra (which is not an option in my book). i'm not large-chested, so this seemed like a design flaw to me.",0
"I bought this dress to wear to a rehearsal dinner. like other reviewers have said it is a true shift dress. i'm 5'2, 114lbs and the 0 fit me like a glove. it was a little hard to get the top on because the bow is not detachable (wish there was a snap or something) but once on i was in love. i may have to safety pin my bra to the bow so it doesn't show because it kept showing when i tried on. overall a very beautiful dress.",1
I would say that this blouse runs 1-2 sizes too small. the fabric is unique - it's like gauze backed by fine netting - and the workmanship is excellent.,1
"Cut out design, no seems or hems.
 very disappointed in retailer",0
Love the bright color of this dress for spring and the loose fit and light material are very comfortable.,1
"Wore it a couple of times, it is cool and comfortable. washed it and the raw edges are starting to fray. i might get one or two more wears out of it. hand washed and hung dry.",0
"Great cut & fit! the length is perfect, too. i like the weight of the skirt overall. good for all seasons.",1
They are as comfortable as sweat pants. i can wear these all day and then some and be comfy. i love the fit (skinny's can be hard for me - i have athletic thighs) and the length is fantastic. i want more pairs in different washes!!,1
I love this cozy jacket. i wanted a neutral colored jacket for casual outings. this does fit true to size. i am 5' 2'' and 105 pounds. i purchased the xs. you can cuff the sleeves to shorten the length of the arms. it has a piping so it doesn't look odd if cuffed. i do find most things/brands at retailer run big on me but not this item.,1
"I was so excited to order this dress. i loved that it had a normal neck, nice length, and there wasn't a hole in the back. but this dress is just plain awful. the top fit tight across the bust, it flattened me out like i was wearing a too tight sports bra. then the back zipper puckered and bumped up like there is too much zipper for the fabric. i could not get the zipper to lay flat. the fabric is itchy and very cheap feeling. on top of it all the colors are much brighter than they appear in the",0
This jacket looks great and is well made. the material is very lush however the body of the jacket runs big while the sleeves are tight.,0
I've been wearing this very comfortable and cute coat for 2 weeks. it is already tearing at the seams somehow. the quality of this is very poor.,0
These run small. i normally wear 28 on ag stevie's and paige jeans so i ordered these in 28 and they were very tight. otherwise very well made and super cute but i had to return them.,0
"Omg - i laughed so hard after i put these on. i was so excited to get them. i ordered them in my usual 4. i got a little suspicious when i pulled them out and noticed they had an elastic waist band.

they were a little too small for me and even if they were not it's hard to imagine a world in which they didn't make me look like an oompa loompa or a hobbit! they are beautifully made and i kept looking at the picture and wondering why they don't look like that on me? i definitely have a curvier sh",0
"I wished these fit a little better. unfortunately, they were a little tight in the thighs and if i didn't pull the waist of the pants up, i had sagging crotch and the pockets hung out. needless to say i made a return.",0
"Material is very thin, and although this is apparent in the design, i just didn't like the way the cuffed sleeves felt...",0
"Absolutely beautiful dress. i bought a size 8 and found it tts. i typically buy 6/8 in retailer dresses. the print is gorgeous (i am a sucker for anything with poppies) and i love the silky material; hugs your curves and flows nicely. i was worried the torso would be too long based on prior reviews, and because i am of short torso, but it fits well. would definitely recommend.",1
"I had a dress that felt like this in 1993. it jiggles, even if you don't. no amount of spanx can cure a dress jiggling of its own accord. the neckline that i had thought would be classic instead veered into frumpy. all in all i felt like it belonged in a discount store surrounded by polyester brethren.",0
"I saw this coat online and loved it. the blue collar is great. the length is great, fits over bottom. it is quite warm. the arms are a little tight but they loosen up. the sale price plus 40% off was the ticket.",1
"The small, zipped and laid flat, measures 16"" across at the bottom of the armholes, 11"" at the waist and 18"" from shoulder seam to bottom edge. it's too small for a size 0, and not by just a little! too bad, because it really is very pretty.",0
It's way more distressed than it looks in the picture and that was a no for me.,0
"I went on a wild goose chase for these jeans, as they were sold out all around the country. i finally got the last pair from some store in the midwest! they are my favorite pair of jeans, they fit very well. however, for the price, they should not get loose and baggy after 1-2 wears. i hate that they need to be washed and dried so often so that they will fit properly. expensive jeans should not sag. i have abercrombie jeggings for a fraction of the price that never get loose, even after 20 wears",1
"You want to buy this! it's so comfy and stylish, yet casual. the sale price is amazing. if anything, the arms of the coat are a bit thin compared to the body of the coat. overall, it fits well though. i ordered an xs. i almost want to order the other color i love it so much. i will probably wear this year round but it will be especially cute in autumn!",1
I love this! i can dress it up with a sharp white button down and skirt or match it with grey leggings and boots for easy sunday's.,1
"I love the style of this dress and the way it lays. looks nice on, just wish it were longer. i normally wear size small but had to return for a medium so that it was long enough.",1
"Poor quality, material looks much thinner and cheaper than pictured.",0
Love to just throw on this shirt with whatever accessories and skinny jeans. easy to wear and very comfortable,1
"This tee is such a staple for me. i bought it in the green and it is such an elegant deep emerald. the perfect shade. the shirt has some detail that is not shown - there is stitching/seaming along the side in the front and back that give the shirt a good structure. the shirt also has a great weight to it. the knit is sort of a vertically ribbed knit but thicker than a classic ribbed tank top. the edges of the material are also open, almost-frayed edges. the additional detail on this shirt defini",1
I was just at the store and purchased this cute top which runs tts for me. i wasn't expecting to find anything at the store but the beautiful lace and adorable tie at the front caught my eye so i bought the small which is my usual size at retailer (34d-27-35) and it fits perfectly. the material is a touch thin but that's okay with me since i don't want heavy clothes for the warmer months anyway. i also don't find this top particularly see through as it's black and will wear a full coverage bra wit,1
I loved this skirt on the rack. but it was not lined and super scratchy when worn. i could barely wear it for the length it took to try it on. so sad. such a gorgeous skirt.,0
"This dress is beautiful, made with high-quality fabric, unique design and color, etc.
but it fits so weird! i am hourglass shaped so this dress seemed pretty ideal, but i just couldn't make it work. it was heavy and awkward feeling when on, the clasp at the breast would definitely not stay closed long, and would undoubtedly need replacing sooner than later. the sleeves are too fluttery and long. the dress itself is just too bulky and has too much of that beautiful fabric. maybe a really tall, s",0
"Adorable fall dress. but it runs huge -- i'm an hourglass 8 or 10 usually and the 6 fit best in the top and full skirt (36d, 30 waist) but sadly each size the sleeves get like 2 inches shorter. since these are blouses sleeves they look off. so sad bc this dress is adorable otherwise. if you always find sleeves too long for you, snap up this gem, this is for you!",0
"I'm 5'5 and 130lbs and i was swimming in the small. the arms are very boxy, the sleeves too long, and and it just wasn't a flattering fit at all. the color and design on the front are both nice. the sweater is made in china and very, very itchy. i own wool sweaters and wear them with layers, but there was no way this was going to be comfortable. very disappointed, especially given the price, but perhaps that's why there are so many left at the end of the season and on sale. this one is going bac",0
"So i was super excited to get this skirt, unfortunately it's not what i thought it would be. the color is much different then what pictured, it has bronze threading and the black on the picture is more gray in real life. the material isn't so great easier, i thought it would be thicker but instead it's pretty thin and wrinkles easy. the design is very cute and it is a flattering shape but the material is just too poor for me to give this a good rating. i wouldn't say it's itchy like the other re",0
I am 5'4 and a curvy girl and find this dress to be super flattering in fit and length. i got a size 14 which is my typical size. the slip is a little tight in the bust area for me so i find it easier to put on first and then the dress over which is possible because it snaps in and out at the shoulders. it arrived super wrinkled but i found tossing it in the dryer for a few min helped - is it dry clean which is slightly high maintenance but so cute it's worth it. great dress for transitioning in,1
"This is definitely again, a bit big. i'm usually a med, that is what i got, i could have gotten a small, but the arm holes might have been a tad tight then. i'm keeping the med, in case it shrinks, as it is part rayon, and rayon always shrinks if put in the washer. it is a great casual piece that will go with most anything. i love the tie, as you can then tighten the waist up a bit, or leave looser. the material is soft and not clingy. this is why i love a rayon blend. it hits me below my waist",1
It was huge. material looked good but was too bulky. will be returning it.,0
"This sweater runs true to size. i am 5'7' and 125 lbs and ordered the small. it has a beautiful mix of colors that reminds me of a creamsicle. it is a well made, heavy sweater that will definitely keep you warm. if you like the feel of wool, buy it. if not, pass on it.",1
"I loved this dress when i saw it in the store. the colors, weight, fabric. love. love. love. 
unfortunately i have to agree with other reviewers, the pockets and the positing of the draw string made my hips look unflatteringly large. i tried on a size 0 petite, which is my usual size. all flowed nicely except for when you get to the pockets. truly disappointed as it was beautiful in every other way. but in the end, i had to pass.",0
I wish it were easier to get in this dress. i'm 5'4 with a 36d and i couldn't get it on. it's so pretty though.,0
"This sweater is beautiful but runs big. i got the xs (5'3"", 110lbs) and it's very roomy. i love the thickness, the color, the pockets, and even the roominess except for the sleeves. they are very long and very wide, which makes it look bulky. if sleeves were slimmer it would look like a cute intentionally oversized style- instead i look like a kid who borrowed a giant sweater. i think it would work better on a taller, slim person. but i still like it.",1
"I saw this online first and didn't care for it. then i saw it in-store and purchased it with little memory of the online experience, because the dress is that much better in person: it's (nearly) seasonless, looks great with fall boots, and has garnered many compliments. this is one of those that the internet can't really do justice to. i withhold a star for quality since the snap-in keeps for the slip were confusing (and maybe it's just the one i bought): one of the keeps was detached from the",1
"I actually love this dress.  the colors on the dark gray are mesmerizing.  the design of the placket adds a special touch to the look.  my issue is the way it looks on my body--not flattering.  i already have a squarish apple (squarple?!) body and the cut emphasizes this more.  i was hoping the fabric would hang on me the same way the ivory dress on the curly haired model does, so i sized up.  all this did was make me look wider, especially at the shoulders.  the drawstring at the elastic makes",1
This is a great little top. the tie sits right at the waist and loose enough to slide over top of pants or shorts. the detailing at neck and shoulders is very eye catching. i received several compliments when i wore it.,1
"I am 5' 7"" with an athletic build (small chest, small waist, muscular hips/thighs). this shirt just hangs on me and makes me look much larger than i am. i purchased a small, an extra small would be way too short. i could see how it works for fuller figured girls.",0
So stylish. i have gotten tons of compliments on this sweater. i absolutely love it!,1
"Nice fit, very comfortable if you wear a thin shirt underneath.",1
"I ordered this because the reviews were outstanding. i am returning it. although the embroidery looks fine on screen, in person it looks cheap and tacky. moreover, the high ruffled neck goes a step too far -- into over-the-top victorian cutesy.
overpriced, to boot.
obviously, mine is a minority opinion.",0
I am in love with this suit. i got the white floral. it's beautiful and classy. it feels like great quality too! i am going to get the black color too when it's back in stock. i am 5'9 and about 140lbs (32 dd) and i'm wearing a medium. i got both the small and medium and decided to keep the medium. it does have more fabric with the medium but the bigger size covers my chest and bigger bottom.,1
"A versatile, pretty and feminine addition to your closet. perfect with black pants, jeans, shorts...dress it up, dress it down.",1
Material was a tad rough for my liking. the color did nothing for my olive complexion. given the price of this shirt (even with 20% off) i don't think it's worth it. if i'm spending $100+ on a blouse i need to love it and i do not love this one...going back.,0
"I bought this earlier in the summer in size xl. i've gotten such good use out of it. the fit on me matches the model. the details of the crochet lace add such a nice touch. not your typical hoodie. but, just the same comfort. i've washed in cold in my machine & air dried. it hasn't shrunk. one of my favorite purchases. perfect for chilly weather or when you go into a/c areas. would love this in other colors. great piece!",1
This shirt is simply pretty. it's light and dresses up a distressed pair of jeans.,1
"I love this! great quality and flattering. i'd definitely agree that it runs true to size, as i had to size up because it was the only size available, and it is a little large in the stomach and rear, but it works well in the chest area. the v neck isn't too low and the sides provide good coverage up top. also, it covers the rear end well! material is nice and thick and the seams are good quality. super happy with this purchase, just wish it was in stock in the smaller size so it held me in more",1
"Pretty tank, embroidered flowers just as pictured. slightly see through so that a cami would be a must. for the price, should be more of a show stopper...unfortunately just average.",0
"I got the floral suit and honestly, it's the most beautiful bathing suit i have ever owned. i have yet to wear it to the pool or beach so i don't know how it holds up when getting wet. i can see where other reviewers have said there is no support in the chest. it is padded which is nice, but no underwire or anything to hold the girls up. if you are big chested this could be an issue - not so much for me. :) looking forward to wearing this suit when the weather gets warmer!",1
"Ordered this on a whim, in my normal size large, and so glad i did. it's just beautiful. the color is a tea stained white background with soft grey blue and cinnamon colored tiny flowers. it has a soft, fairy princess vibe that could be dressy or casual. the 3/4 sleeves have elastic. it just flows nicely over the body and isn't oversized like so many tops. there's a ruffle with a slight peplum in the back. it's a beauty.",1
The neckline is very tight and itchy. the arm holes are deeply cut. the length is not as long in person as it is on the model in the picture. it's short-waisted. it's too bad because the embroidery is very pretty.,0
"Nice quality, beautiful colors. so nice i bought another as a gift.",1
"Simply perfect. i ordered the white floral maillot in a large (5'6""-ish, 145 pounds) and it is so comfortable and flattering that i do not want to take it off. the colors are so vibrant and accurate, which is great considering not all internet item photos are the same in person. i do recommend ordering a size up -- the medium was snug, but definitely remember that your suit shrinks when wet. now that they have a new print -- hello fish!! -- i really really want another!",1
"I love this blazer so much i bought it in both colors. i'm 5'7"", 120 pounds and bought the size 4 which is perfect. initially when i tried it on in the store i thought i needed the 6 because it was a little tight in the arms and shoulders. the 6 was too boxy on me and i'm so glad i went with the 4. it stretched, especially the arms, and fits perfect. i love how i can dress this down (with a graphic tee and jeans) or dress up (with a blouse and cropped black pants).",1
"I'm pretty tan and i always have to be careful with white tops or pants. i love the embroidery detail but this top is practically see-through for me. it is double-lined, but i could still see my bra. very pretty though and i was disappointed that it didn't work for me.",0
"Beautiful. got several compliments when wearing it. does not hold up with washes though. threads unraveling everywhere. i am thinking of returning it for this reason. fits true to size. i am 5'4"" 118 lbs, xs fit. i am smaller on top.",0
"I love the way that this suit looked, however i found that it was lacking in support. i was disappointed to discover upon trying it on, that it just does not cover my butt. it fit elsewhere just fine, but the slim cut up the sides left it a little too revealing for my liking. in addition i found the top to be awkwardly fitting around the chest area. i am a 34b and ordered a small and it seemed to be too baggy at the top.",0
"This top is absolutely adorable, i cannot express how much i love it. paired with skinny jeans and a bright cardi for the spring, this can easily transition into summer. it's actually cuter irl than in the picture. if you are on the fence about this, get it! you won't regret it.",1
"When i read car coat, i expect a little more weight. it really is just a thin, long blazer. also, the colors appear different online. i expected a red/maroon with bue and white stripe, so maybe i mis-read completely...? it is actually brown/mustard/beige combo. not what i expected, so it will be a return.",0
"I fell in love with this dress online. i listened to the reviews and ordered a size up. i got it in the mail and couldn't wait to try it on! i was sad that to find, that while it was tight across the chest and the keyhole in the back seemed to pull, it was really large in the body. in addition, while the lace is beautiful it is very fragile. i still think this is a great dress but definitely for someone who is small chested. for reference i am a 32dd and size 2-4 and i ordered a medium.",1
"Love this top! cloth & stone makes excellent quality clothes that are durable and have unique details. this top can go with many different looks and i can't wait to take it out for a spin!

i bought the medallion crops to go with this top and it is an awesome combo, i would definitely check it out!",1
I ordered my usual size; however when it arrived it appeared to fit a 9 year old! the color and style are adorable. i will need to exchange it for 2 sizes larger! i am so shocked at maeve's sizing.,0
I absolutely adore this skirt! sadly it was a lot of skirt for me- i'm 5 feet nothing and it would have been too much fabric to hem. wish this skirt came in a petite size. great color and a fun option for the fall wedding season!,1
"The shirt is beautifully made and very comfortable. i'm a medium though, and i ordered as such- but it's way too big for me.",1
The cheshire dress is lovely. the fit is true to size and the quality is awesome. i love the way the sleeves lay on my shoulders. i would definitely recommend this dress!,1
"I'm 5'7, 125lbs, and the small fits perfectly. the sleeves are the right length (i have long arms and legs), and the body fits loosely, without looking sloppy. at my height, the small is not long enough to wear as a tunic, which is fine.

unfortunately, the shirt arrived with makeup stains around the laces and the inside of the shirt, so i had to wash it before wearing it.

i only purchased this shirt because it was on sale.",1
"The online picture does not do this top justice. much cuter in person. soft and so comfortable. got this in my usual xs. paired with a white ""fluffy"" sweater and jeans to wear to a casual charity event. hope they do more of this top in other colors.",1
"I'm a short girl, but i usually wear tops in a small or medium at retailer. for me, i would have needed this shirt in a size at least one notch smaller than even offered. this shirt is adorable. love the details. i wanted it so bad, which is why i paid so much for a basic t-shirt. still, it was large to the point of frumpiness and could have used some sort of scoop or v-neck to break up the dots.",1
I love the swing and the pretty color of the dress. it's fun to dress up or dress down. the fabric is a little thin so you will need good undergarments if you have lumps and bumps.,1
"I saw this in the store and was glad i didn't order it earlier online. i thought it would be beautifully stitched but it was rather flat and unimpressive in person. i like more unusual and flattering pieces, and this just wasn't it. no compliments here.",0
"I love this top! although, i wish i had ordered the large rather than the medium. i am 5'4"", 138 pounds and a 34d. the medium just fits but is ever so slightly snug across my shoulders. it will work; though i will probably have it dry cleaned rather than risk shrinkage by washing at home.",1
"I saw this in the sales section today and was drawn to it by the color and style. i really didn't think it'd fit on me, even though the only size available was a size 12, because it looked like a sheath-type dress that's more body hugging, and usually such dresses just don't work well on my wider hips and hourglass frame. howeverl here's what i thought:

pros:
- beautiful blush pink. it looks exactly the same in person as online.
- very comfortable as the other reviewer mentioned. t",1
"I love simple, comfortable tops with interesting details and one that i can easily throw on without much fuss. this top is made for people like me!!! the ribbed knit is super soft without being too thin, the lace is quite pretty without being too delicate. normally, tops like this have the lace portion sewn to the hem but this top actually has a whole layer of lace under the knit outer shell. so, it's like wearing a layer of lace and ribbed sweater on top of the lace. the good news is, the lace",1
"I loved the look of this top online - it had great lines. i was so disappointed when i received it.  it has zero support/lining and i'm not large chested to need a lot. it's also incredibly awkward to get on and the tie in the back is only long enough to knot it, making it even harder to get off. it was returned.",0
Ordered a size medium as i usually take a medium in retailer coats- the wool is wonderful however the stripped bands are sewn into the fabric which add to the weight. the coat has an odd shape - not a line or straight. the medium was large on me. the bottom edges of the coat did not line up when buttoned and there was no inside hook or button to help even out the bottom edges. sadly this coat will be returned.,0
This open cardigan runs really big and has way too much fabric. even going down a size i felt like i was swimming in it.,0
"I wanted to love this turtleneck. i read the reviews before ordering. i love the color, the weight of the knit, the ribbing. the small fit me perfectly; i am a 34b, not broad shouldered, and on the thin side in my upper body. however, this item has a strange ""blousy"" fit. the picture of the back view hints at this but it's worse in person. it's like a bell shaped top or even slightly trapezey, which simply doesn't work with my shape. plus, i'm long waisted. i could have made this work had it not",0
"Received this blouse to wear for the holidays and was not disappointed. the design of the shirt is to be relaxed and flowing. i usually wear a medium which is what i ordered. the shirt fit fine but i probably could of managed with a small if i did not want it as relaxed. so if you are between sizes, you might want to size down. if i did order a small, the sleeves might of been a tad short since i have longer arms. the shirt is sheer, so you will need a cami underneath. i wore a black one which w",1
"This suit did nothing for me. the top has zero support. this would work for a younger woman who does not require any support and is smaller chested. also, the top gapped in the center. it just did not fit right. the top is very thin showing everything. a light padding would make a big difference in this suit. also i could not get a good fit. as i tightened the top, the back would ride up. the bottoms are ok. not renatkable",0
"I instantly fell in love with the graphic pattern on this drapey layering piece, and i've received compliments every time i have worn it. however i seriously considered returning it because the way the garment is cut causes it to bunch awkwardly at the sides. maybe it's still just too big--even though medium or large is my size in tops, the medium in this sweater clearly looks baggier on me than it does on the model in the photo, for instance. it is definitely not slimming, but the striking patt",1
I really likes these jeans. they are comfortable with stretch and look cute. the price is high but an investment for sure !,1
"This is a very pretty blouse with a vintage, romantic looking fabric. the tiny pleats near the neck and shoulders are lovely. i love the colors...black, brown, and cream. it's hard to find a top that can be worn well with both black and brown. the long tie adds a romantic feel. this blouse is totally sheer so requires a cami or tank. i actually love the blouse, but returned it because it is super blousy. i am 5'2"", 140 lbs., and the small was fine. it is just so blousy, that even belting it didn",1
"This top has slightly more of a burnout effect than i realized. i like it and its great for layering, but you must wear something underneath as it is quite sheer.",1
This is a great layering piece. took it on a trip and wore with both a long sleeve and tank under it. is more 'khaki' color then the photo shows - which was a goo thing for me.,1
Love the color. love the design. at the hem this top runs wide. i'm still deciding whether to keep this as i think the wide hem may be somewhat flattering on me.,1
I loved the way it looks on. fit tts. only problem for me was it was so itchy. there is that small amt. of wool in it. if you have any problem with wool this may not work for you,0
"Love, love, love this dress. you can dress it up with high heels, or down with sandals . a mid weight material with seperate slip that serves as a lining . i am athletic , 5' 7"" and 132 lbs and bought a size small. i have broad shoulders , average waist , short torso , small hips and long legs. in the spring a denim jacket would look perfect with this dress.",1
I can't stop wearing this. it's perfect for layering! the fit is great-loose but not a bag. i love that it's a wide open knit.,1
"I am super-pleased with this cardigan, which is at a terrific sale price. i saw this in the pink color in the state street retailer in chicago, and i loved the feel of the material but wasn't sure about the color for me. when i saw they had a neutral striped version online, i decided to get it. the material is very soft and the beige/neutral color has a gray undertone which is good for my skintone. the front is double-layered and it has a fun seaming detail in the back and an ""unfinished"" trim whi",1
"The first time i wore this tank it started pilling around the arms and down the sides. it is terribly quality, and gets worse with every wear and wash. possibly the worst wear on a new clothing item i've ever seen. like the design and fit, immediately relegated it to a weekend/home shirt because it was unprofessionally pilly and the pills are small so can't be shaved off.",0
Unforgiving to even your smallest imperfections.,0
I have this tank in all colors...it is superb for layering...comfortable and i love that you can reverse it for a different neckline...and it's long enough!,1
"There was only a l in store but i tried it as a gauge. given i am normally a xs/0, i knew it was going to be too big but wanted to see if i could get an idea of how it might look in my regular size. it truly is a lovely blouse - gauzy fabric, flowy feel and an easy piece to dress up or down. however the xs was much shorter in the sleeves, (above the wrist bone on me), and much shorter in the body, (sat at mid pelvis - for ref i am 5'7""). this completely altered the look and i think i would have",1
"I'm 5'1 and 110 pounds and i ordered the 26 petite. the jeans are fabulous...flattering....comfortable...i could go on and on. the fabric is super soft and the fit hugs in all the right places. it is a nice flare bottom. i will have to wear these with heels or wedges, they are too long for flats.",1
Very light weight and soft fabric. i bought the blue but did not try green or grey. i love blue with my skin tone and am afraid green may make my skin look yellow. did not see the green in my store though. very comfy and flattering dress. runs tts.,1
"I was so excited for this romper, but was disappointed after trying it on. the material felt cheap for the price, and it runs quite small. will be returning. :(",0
"I bought this dress in the green color and i am absolutely in love with it!! it is very figure flattering and looks great even though i have a larger bust. it is also a great length, hits about an inch or two above the knee. highly recommend!!!",1
"I have wanted a boiled wool jacket for years. finally. i got the gray/navy. soft, warm and classic. i expect it to last forever. it is the right weight for out door wear in warmer climates or late fall/early spring in minnesota. the sleeves are long, but push up nicely, and roomy enough to go over a long sleeved blouse. i paired it with the tartan charlie trousers, and it is very polished for work. soft. but someone sensitive to wool might find it itchy. i agree that it is a little boxy--but i t",1
"I am not sure where all of the other reviews on these pants went, but when i ordered mine, there were mostly all good reviews. i absolutely love these lounge pants. someone mentioned that they thought they were a little itchy where the lace is but while they may not be the softest pants ever, they are certainly very comfortable, not itchy at all. i am 5'6"""" 140 lbs and i ordered the medium. the fit was a little snug at first but, as i wore them, they stretched and loosened. i also wear them with",1
"Bought this dress without trying it on but listened to the previous reviews saying this ran small and wow does it. i usually wear a 6 but ordered an eight which was hard to get on even with the upsizing. i do have a 34ddd bust so i do have a difficult time when dresses have no stretch over give in that area. overall beautiful dress, fabric is not stretchy which killed it for me.",0
This is such a perfect tee to wear on cold days! it's a fall/winter/spring staple for sure. it's very soft and falls perfectly. i would definitely recommend it.,1
This dress is so cute and comfy! i purchased it for my friend's wedding brunch celebration - perfect transitional piece!,1
I love this jacket. runs true to size. plan on wearing this a lot this spring and summer. perfect for our weather here. looks just like a jacket but has the stretch and give of a sweater and not heavy like other pea coats. can be dressed up or casual.,1
This dress looks so cute in the pictures-i love the style. ordered typical size and it was huge-felt like many sizes too big.,0
The fabric and colors of this dress are beautiful but the fit is terrible. i had to go up a size to get a fit in the waist but it was then incredibly loose in the shoulders. what a pity. had to return.,0
"I have been looking for a summer dress with a bit of a chic flair to it- i was thinking black, tank top dress. after weeks of hunting for the idea in my head, i started to branch out. i reluctantly tried this on thinking it would be 'baggish', plain, and possibly too short. wow was i wrong!! this dress is everything + more. wear with some wedges, belt it (although it doesn't need it at all!), layer a high neckline lace top over it, the possibilities are endless. although i loved the green, the b",1
"I wanted to love this dress!! i eyed it for months before deciding to purchase, and when i hit submit, i purchased a size down, given the prior reviews. excitedly, i whiled away the moments until it appeared in my mailbox. as soon as this dress was delivered, i ripped it out of its packaging and ooohed and aaahed over the beautiful lace overlay and the halter cut. hurriedly, i pulled the dress over my head, allowing it to drape over my body. and drape it did, but not in a good way; rather, the d",0
Stylish or comfy - often the choice when looking for casual but not with this top! it's comfy and cozy and stylish to boot. the sleeves are fun and create a nice line of interest. you can pair this with jeans for a casual day or dress it up with slacks and heels and be comfy either way.,1
"Really wanted to love this, especially with the lacing and long length for this off-the-shoulder top. when the top arrived, the lacing was stiff and length of the straps were long so that the bottom of the lace didn't completely cover my black strapless bra (and i felt it sat a bit too low down my chest). thought about taking in the straps but then the area around the armpits would be uncomfortable. i did love the length of the top though. wish this top was a keeper, but going to have to return.",0
I was really disappointed when i tried this top on. the design and cut of the neckline is very bulky and just off. the cut of the top overall was just off.,0
Very unflattering and no shape or flair. lots of extra material but no swing or shape. do not recommend.,0
"I love the idea of this top, but there is just way too much fabric involved in person! i'm 5'2 and usually wear a small or medium to accommodate a fuller chest. i ordered a small and it fit fine around the chest but the huge swing hem combined with the slightly stiff fabric is just enormously unflattering. i feel like they could have made about 3 shirts out of it. i think the picture must have it pinned a ton in the back, the silhouette is nothing like shown. if there were just less fabric, i wo",0
"Had to have these when i saw them online. usually an ag girl, but loved the button fly and boyfriend fit. originally ordered a 28 and returned for a 27. after a couple of wears, wish i bought the 26. a must have!",1
"The colors of this top are perfect for spring, i love the embroidery and like the sleeves with the ties at the bottom. what i didn't like and primary reason i may be returning, is the elastic bottom. it cuts off at an awkward spot on my waist and makes my top section look short and wide. i am very disappointed about this, as the rest of the blouse is gorgeous.",0
"The fabric on this shirt was beautifully woven and so soft/cozy. but the shirt was so wide! i'm 5'2"", 103lbs and got an xs. there was room for two of me in there. it draped very well, but instead of looking slouchy and cool, it just looked too big. so, back it goes.",0
"Then this one is for you! so disappointed upon receipt of this skirt, as i had been eyeing it for a while and was excited to see it on sale. based upon the pictures, i thought the black stitching was just an interesting outline detail, but it is actually masking this skirt's ugly secret:  a pouch. yes, it literally has a pouch smack dab in the middle of your abdomen, which does not lay flat. the material also looks rather snag prone and already had a few pulls in spots.                 this one",0
"Sadly, going back. ordered m, light color option, very difficult to pull over my head, not a good sign. got it on and neckline looked attractive (height w/o being a mock turtle), but whole thing a bit small around middle. could order the l, but i'm not liking the feeling of the fabric, it feels tight with restrictive and nonuniform stretch: 33 cotton/27 poly/27 acrylic and 95 rayon/5 spandex ""contrast"", which must mean the stripes. combine w/fact that the two wide stripes are right at my middle",0
"The fabric is quality, nice thicker fabric. the fit was strange, the top part fit great through the arms and shoulders, except my bust makes the front stick out and results in a maternity look. it was also slightly wide, i considered taking it in on the sides. ultimately it wouldn't be worth the money. it would be a great top for someone with a smaller chest.",1
"I am a loyal retailer shopper, but find many items are hit or miss. this definitely is a hit especially in black! i am 5'4"" 125 lbs and 36ddd. i usually take a m or m petite in retailer tops. because this is flowy and long, a s petite fits perfectly. the style is one-of-a-kind, the lace is heavy and top quality, and when you try on the right size, it hits perfectly. the lavender is a dusty shade that won't work well in fall/winter. it would look wonderful in cranberry or forest green.",1
"This top doesn't at all fit like it does on the model. the mid section is very wide and boxy and the material is thick and almost sweatshirt-like. i typically wear size small or 4, but perhaps an xs might've fit or looked better. sadly i must return this shirt.",0
"I love peasant shirts so wanted to try it. cute top, but v-neck was lower than i was expecting. i have to wear an undershirt under this for that and also because of sheerness. fyi- shirt is off-white so stark white cami didn't work. was struggling to find something, but have the leana v-neck in navy- worked perfect and follows neckline exactly. now really cute! need something not long sleeves to wear under for spring weather here, but will keep and try to figure it out. 5'4, 135 lbs, ordered xs.",1
"I bought this top in lilac size s since other reviewers said it has a lot of fabric. the color and the quality were great -- loved that it had the lining underneath. if your bust is bigger than an a cup, beware. the top basically flared out from the farthest point on my bust and the fabric below just hung there. it was a pregnancy look. perhaps that's why the model has her arms crossed in front -- to give the illusion that it tapers in below the ribs, but it does not. unfortunately, this one is",0
"At first i was taken by the beautiful lacework and the pictures online showing what appeared to be a loose but shaped silhouette. the pictures must have been staged with pins in the back because, in person, the shirt fits like a circus tent. without exaggeration, there is a surplus of about 16 inches.

the material is still beautiful. and because of that, i haven't decided whether i'll return this shirt or try cutting out some excess fabric to create a cleaner, more fitted shape.",0
"I've been waiting for this to go on sale, and just picked one up in store. the details and style of this blouse do not disappoint! since it's billowy in nature, a size smaller fits me perfectly.",1
"For me a good pencil skirt makes me feel so ladylike. i love eva franco pencils but be warned they are designed to be a tight fit through the tush. i wear a 12 and i ordered the 12 in this skirt. the pouch another reviewer pointed out seems intended to be a pocket, but because the skirt fits me pretty snugly it doesn't stick out when i walk and sit. the fabric does seem like it would snag easily so i'll choose accessories thoughtfully. for reference i have a 33"" waist and 42"" hips.",1
"Cute socks, very comfy as well. good quality in person.",1
"I really wanted to love this top, but there is way too much fabric. it looks nothing like the pictures. it was more like a maternity top vs. a swingy top. i'll be returning this one.",0
"I keep trying to find a peplum that works for me, but so far i have been unsuccessful. i just do not think that my shape and the peplum shape play well together?aside from the peplum issue, this shirt had a massive amount of material and runs large. the material alone is thick, making it a bulkier shirt, then add the volume of the peplum and i looked (and felt) huge. needless to say, this one was returned, sale or no sale.",0
"Did not work for me. whatsoever. the stripes were adorable but the piece just didn't fit like on the model. the collar was practically choking me and the tie just didn't make my figure look the way it normally does. aka i looked frumpy and chunky, which i'm not. going back.",0
"Alright, so i really love this shirt. but i am having it taken in to fit me. i weigh 110 and am 5 foot 3 and pretty petite, and this shirt is too big on me and i got an xs. i didn't wanna get xxs and am glad i didn't because i think it would be too short. i'm going to keep the shirt, but it is too big on me, it puffs out in the front and some in the back when you stand certain ways and i need to have it taken in, or else it isn't as flattering as it should be. the material is awesome and i love",1
So this may be my least favorite thing i have ever bought from retailer. this top had so much extra material it was like wearing a bag or parachute. it looked a million times cuter in the photos.,0
"I love these pants, but they are a bit too long. like the reviewer below, they hit me right at the ankles. i am 5'6"". i am going to hem them a bit. also they were a little bigger in the waist than expected--could have ordered a size 28 instead of a 29.",1
"This shirt is so soft and luxuriously feeling. the material looks very nice and seems well made. it has a nice length to it, so it can be worn properly with leggings without any worry. i'm a 36d and can't get the button to close properly, so i'd recommend sizing up if this could be an issue for you. overall it will be a very versitile piece i'm excited to add to my wardrobe.",1
"1. i'm 5'5"" tall, 143 lbs and 38 (36d) - 32 -40 and the medium fit me well.

2. my only problem is that the collar keeps falling to the back. i feel like the shoulder isn't cut right to sit on the shoulder. i seem to have this problem a lot with this brand, where the shirt just wants to fall to the back.",1
"Love the material -- it is a thick cotton, but it is structured enough and thick enough so that it doesn't cling to me (in a bad way). its like wearing a sweater. my only beef with it is that the seam where the black material is stitched to the gray material creates a bump in the silhouette. (the black material is the same as the gray and it also has a herringbone pattern thats not really visible in the pictures) i would have preferred a uniform material rather than a panel sewn in. not a huge d",1
"Granted that i am not as reed thin, or as young, as the model. but i am tall and reasonably slender. i have long hands and small wrists, which would be a factor in the overall effect of this garment. this poncho looked like some sad old stretched out who-knows-what that you'd keep in the car for emergency purposes, in case you needed warmth if the car broke down in a snowstorm -- and i have one of those foldable reflective blankets in the glove box for that purpose. i was looking for a statement",0
"I saw this sweater on-line and loved it until i tried it on. i'm 5-7, flat chested, 135 pounds and i ordered a size small. the sweater fit everywhere except for my arms. this sweater will work great if you are short. consider making your sweaters a little longer, because i do not consider myself tall.",0
"Was looking more for a tailored, blazer like chino jacket. this was just too bulky. usually wear a 00p, ordered the 00, and could have put a chunky sweater underneath. 5'4'', 110 lbs, 32c for reference.",0
Love this medium weight wool cape. it is so much prettier in person. the photos look a bit boring but this cape is very versatile and simple to wear. some capes hang oddly on me but this one was flattering without the bulk. not itchy either. the photos don't really show the sleeves clearly but there is a sleeve built into the cape. the taupe color is a rich neutral that can be paired with thin or thicker turtlenecks or shirts. the sleeves are bracelet length so full length sweaters will show und,1
Thank goodness for a nice white basic tee that is not see through! i go back and forth between an xs and s depending on how i want an item to fit - i don't like things to be too form fitting because i still have a little post-baby pooch. i went with a s in this shirt and it works well. my only complaint is that the neckline is not totally straight - where the seam comes up from under the arm to hit the neckline it bumps out a little bit. but it's a great nicer basic that will go well with almost,1
"This top is beautiful! but the fabric is really stiff and itchy. in addition, it's rather cropped or short. the real disaster and heart break for me was when i washed it. the tag recommends dry cleaning, but allows for hand washing. i should have dry cleaned - it shrunk even more when i washed it on delicate setting in cold. too bad, because this looks so cute the first time you wear it. if you're up for a dry cleaning bill and don't mind a little stiff scratchy material, you'll be fine buying t",0
"I'm pretty flat-chested (34aa) so it's hard for me to say how the sizing runs on this top for others. to me, it's a slim fitting but not tight, true to size t-shirt. i tried the xs regular (dressing room photo) and the small petite (other photo) and i'd say the main fit difference was in the shoulders. the small petite fit me better in the shoulders (xs petite wasn't available). also the neckline of the small petite came up a little higher. the white is a slightly dingy off-white but i think the",1

"I purchased this sweater at my local retailer store a few weeks ago. i picked the dark grey color which is more of a neutral beige or oatmeal color. i love it! i just wish i had purchased it earlier to wear through the fall. it has a substantial weight and is warm. this sweater/poncho has a great drape that is really flattering, especially in the back. it does have slits on the sides so you really would need to wear a layer underneath. i've worn it with a turtleneck and button-ups and it looks rea",1
There were no reviews when i ordered this tunic so nothing to help gauge fit. it is very cute but the fit is strange - very narrow in the shoulders and chest.,0
This is my second pair of pilcro jeans and the second time i am totally impressed. these jeans have a comfortable stretch and rugged wash that is trendy & fun. they are the perfect everyday jean and look great casually with a pair of birkenstocks or converse low tops. the only thing worth pointing out is that i am pretty short (5'4) and the regular length fits me perfectly. this may be an issue for ladies lucky enough to have some extra inches on me.,1
"Like another reviewer, i initially passed by this sweater and thought nothing of it until i noticed it on display... super cute and ultra comfy... the kind of sweater that just beckons to be warn in the fall. i purchased this in the olive color and just love it. very cute and flattering for a poncho-type sweater. i do think it runs a bit large so i sized down for the perfect fit. i highly recommend this item!",1
"This is basically a poncho with arm holes. but it looks great and is well-made. 
i got this in the wine, which is a beautiful color. the design is nice and looks expensive (but i'm not sure how it will hold up after washing), it is oversized and a little boxy. i'm a medium or large on top and i ended up purchasing an xs and it fits just fine in the shoulders and arms. the rest of it is still roomy (though short) but perfectly fine. i got this on sale, so it was well worth the price point.",1
"First, the good: i like the basic shape of the jacket, with its crisply cut lapels
and rounded corners at the bottom...the functional pockets (including the
cool watch pocket), the size of the buttons, the color. i got the honey,
and it was lovely and intense,. now, the bad:
i got the regular 8. the jacket is at least an inch too short. although it's
a small, tight 8, the sleeves are strikingly too long. they would have to
be folded, and the lining which would show is not that attractive.",0
"This blazer is a nice weight for summer. it is more terracotta than rose, but is still a nice color. the fit is tts and flattering. however, the buttons were almost falling off the one i received. i didn't take this as a sign of great quality and plan to return it.",0
"This sweater is beautiful, especially in the bordeaux color. the cable knit in varying directions makes it interesting and unique and the length is great for us short waisted ladies. my big issue with this sweater is the sleeves. there really are no sleeves, just arm holes at the same level as the hem of the sweater, so you feel as if you need to keep your arms pinned to your sides to keep from lifting the sweater up to expose your midsection, or pushing the sleeves way up, which then results in",0
"The pattern is cute. it's a little more subtle than in the photos. the problems were the skirt are 1: pretty sure it will wrinkle in two seconds and 2: it has buttons down the front of it with no lining behind it. which means, if you sit down wearing this skirt and it doesn't lay quite right, it gaps and you can see whatever is or is not underneath! the buttons are like two inches apart, so it's not a tiny little gap. no thanks. also, this skirt fir true to size, it wasn't tight, just gappy.",0

"Really like these -- they fit really well and look great with a pair of chucks and a sweater if i'm dressing down a bit, as well as with flats and a nicer blouse. really versatile. i'm kind of pear-shaped, and these seem to minimize my flaws a bit, too, so that never hurts!",1

Love these! so comfy and a great color! also love that it came in petite! it is so hard to find avoid crop pant in petite!!!,1
"Love this chemise. the lace detail is cute, the length of the skirt is longer than many of the night gowns you'd find in the cute, not frumpy category, and overall it is super soft and comfortable for lounging and sleeping. bought the large, and i'm normally around a size 8-10, between medium and large depending on the cut of the item. the large is slightly on the big size, so the straps move around when i sleep. not a big deal for me, so i kept it.",1

"The moss color intrigued me so i ordered a medium instead of large because it looked oversized. i generally wear a large. medium is a good fit. probably could have ordered the small, but wanted to preserve the draping on the side. this top is very wide but it looks great on. so do size down. love the color variations. it's true to the pics and is a nice addition to my casual lifestyle.",1
Lately retailer tees have been misses for me but i was intrigued by the reviewers comments about the shaping of the tee to enhance the illusion of a waistline. that drew me in because i have a short waist and some shaped tees just cling there and emphasize rolls more than my waist. but not this one. it is more fitted along the back waist and looser in the front. i generally order size large in tees as i did with this one. i don't think the fit is too big because it's cut not to cling anywhere. i h,1

"I bought this in the blue and really wanted to like it--i had plans to check sizing and then order it again in the red, as well! however, this skirt falls victim to the recent design trend of using a pattern for a structured skirt but substituting a softer fabric and (horrors!) an elastic waistband. this ended up just looking kind of cheap and sweatshirty as a result. back it went.",0
"I ordered this in the white in my usual size 26, and these were too big on me (5'5"", 110lbs). the pants bunched up unattractively around my thighs because they were not form-fitting. i am hoping to exchange for the size 25 because i prefer a tighter fit. the style of the pants were very cute. i like the side slit detail and the cropped look. i'm hoping these pants work out for me in the smaller size.",1

"This dress is beautiful and unique but if you are more pear shaped get the correct size to fit your hips. it fits very close through the behind --but is stretchy. as i was putting it on and felt it hugging me closely, i thought it would never work - but when i looked in the mirror i found it looked quite nice even though it clings. and the stretch allows plenty of movement. if i size up to allow more room in the hips then i think it will be too loose on top. so i will just wear it with spanx. th",1

This is a comfortable tunic piece with ample rear coverage. it is lightweight and there is room to layer a thin tank top underneath.the ivory is a marled heather with ivory buttons. it is not anything special in terms of style but it will serve the purpose of being a casual separate for around the house or for a quick errand.,0
"This is very cute, but i will have to size up my large to extra large. and normally i wear a medium or large. it is quite tight as a large. it looks a lot cuter on the model. so i am hoping the extra large does it.",1
"I bought this in the dark gray and it's got a lot of blue undertones to it. it's beautiful and flattering in my regular size, not too fitted -- not as loose as on the model but still roomy enough. i'll take the advice of a previous reviewer and wash only the armpits when needed. this fabric is so delicate i'm afraid it will shrink if i ever submerge the whole thing in water. it's a gorgeous piece and i'm happy to have it for the remaining cool days of the season.",1
"This sweater is beautiful and looks exactly as pictured in terms of fit, length, and color. the fabric is super soft and not at all itchy - feels soft like a boucle type knit. the sleeves are 3/4 length and the weight is maybe a medium-weight (not super warm). i wouldn't see this taking me too far into a northeastern winter, but for right now it's perfect!! fit is tts :)",1

"I love clothes, and my mom raised me to look for styles that are different, and unique. these pants are it! they fit beautifully, but run slightly big. i'm between a 4 and a 6, actually kept both. the 4 fits great in the hips and legs, plenty of room if you have curves (i do not), but it's a tad tight in the waist, if that helps. these are a perfect length, at 5' 7"" they hit above my ankle bone, and look perfect w a pointed, closed shoe. i love the colors, and am bored to death of black and grey",1
"Just to back up what everyone else is saying, this poncho is perfect. it is indeed super soft! casual and fun. i personally thought the coloring at the bottom was even prettier than pictured. this poncho is not tight around the neck, yet not lose. it goes right over your head without messing up your hair. i love the sleeves. they can be worn above the elbow or easily pulled just down below it. a great alternative to a sweater. i ordered the petite xs/s and i'm 5'3. hits right at bum.",1

I ordered these in a medium and they fit but i wanted more coverage so i sized up. i wear a 26 or 27 and i took the large. the large isn't tight at all but the medium was. i like my bottoms to have a lot of coverage and don't mind them a little big. i like how much coverage they provide but still look feminine and cute.,1
"This dress is adorable in the photo; however, in reality, it fits like a tent. the top would be okay although i would need a smaller size if i were to keep it. it flares out in the skirt to become an a-line and it's just not very flattering. if i had read the reviews before ordering, i would have sized down, but i ordered before any reviews had been posted. sadly, i must return.",0

"This shirt is adorable but it's really just a cotton t-shirt. based on the picture online, i thought it would have more weight, be a more substantial fabric. again, it's adorable but not sure how long it will last.",1
I bought this dress on a whim.  i am so glad i did!  got it in black.  it is stunning and comfortable,1
"Cute tee. it's a casual tee with some nice detailing that gives it some style. the fabric is a good thickness. not see-through thin but light enough for warm weather. the color should match pretty much anything. nice neckline. i think it runs slightly large. i hover between a small, extra small with tops and the xs fit nicely. i do have narrow shoulders, 32dd, so women with normal to wide shoulders might prefer their usual size. i don't expect people to gush over it with compliments but it it a",1
"Dress is nice but can't be worn without tights or you are at a risk of indecently exposing yourself. it is around 30"" in length so is more of a tunic than a dress. i'm only 5'1 and it was too short . can't imagine anyone taller even trying to wear this !",0
"Cute top, great for the inner maid marian fan. :) fun twist on t-shirt in regular size. also ordered the alexandria top in somewhat similar vein, but didn't care for that one at all. this one was cute and the fit is flattering. the other is boxy and boring to me. recommend this one.",1
"I liked the colors and the design but it's kind of an odd fabric, no give at all and no drape. stiff and kind of structured feeling for a casual cardigan. the sleeves are extremely narrow and tight. i ordered a medium and it felt like a ace bandage squeezing my arms. my arms are normal sized. if you have exceptionally narrow arms, might work for you. sending it back.",0
"This dress is the absolute best. it is comfy, flattering, cute - pretty much the best dress ever. as a previous reviewer said, ti is a 3 - even 4 - season dress. throw it on with boots and a wool cardi in the winter and youre all set. i didnt even think twice about buying it. perfect length- a little longer in the back but not too short in the front (and i do not like short dresses/skirts). dont think about it... just buy.",1
"So gorgeous! the details make this tank so special! the subtle sequin around the neckline are just enough to make this a dress-up or dress-down top. perfect with skinny jeans for an evening date night or a black cardigan for the office. the fabric is soft -- almost like a very light weight knit sweater, but so light that you can wear it for summer.",1
"Saw online and had to have. got it home and i was swimming in it! i normally am a size l in most retailer brands, but this felt so large! the actual top is lovely, with an airy artistic quality to it. not sure if i will go back for the medium or not.",1
"This dress is elegant and really lovely. it looks like a throwback to the 20s and 30s. it drapes nicely and i think it would be flattering on most body types. and this is why i am recommending it. but be warned: it runs large.

the problem with the dress is that the slip might as well not be there at all--it is completely sheer. for example, i have a couple tattoos and you can see them right through the fabric, which is not the look i'm going for. this might be a deal breaker for some. for me, i",1
I didn't realize that there were sequins on the design. they kept poking my shoulders and made the top very uncomfortable. the white material was also not very flattering on me. it went back.,0

"I took the advise of a reviewer and sized down to xs. i am 5'6 and 110. i could take them off without unbuttoning them, they were hugh, even the xs! they looked like a halloween costume. even at the discounted sale price, awful and kind of made me laugh. but i guess that's why they are still available at this sale price.",0
"I loved the look of this top when i saw it online, however, when i received it i was kinda disappointed. the color of the top was different than what i perceived initially. .it's way more off white. ..not my favorite. the texture/pattern of fabric on the body of the top was too near hanky for me. the sequin detail at neckline is wonderful, but not enough for me to keep. unfortunately i will be returning this one. not a hit for my desired as the tic but some one else might love!",0
"The wash is just as pictured, and the fit is great, i actually got a 29 when i usually wear a 28 but when i wear a belt with them they hug the waist perfectly. im always on the search from 28"" length however these jeans are a 30"" and still look excellent if i roll them up once.",1
"I typically wear a 4/6 but am a little bigger right now, so i went with the medium. was so excited to get these but was very disappointed when i tried them on. they look beautiful, but there is no lining, leaving the fabric uncomfortable. they were also huge! definitely make sure you size down if you d",0
"I'm actually surprised no one has reviewed this yet. i took the plunge because it seemed like a classic wardrobe staple, nothing too flashy or fancy, that would go well with many outfits. my thoughts below:
__________________
pros:
- fits tts. i'm normally either a 10 or 12 and got the large. it fit well and the elastic isn't too tight. fit very well for me because i have wider hips. so if you're straight or slim, you could probably size down.
- exactly as pictured. it does have a nice flow",1
"I agree with all the positive reviews about the look, fit and comfort of this dress.  definitely a four season dress.  for winter i plan on wearing wool tights, wool coat and boots and keeping the waist untied.  for me both the medium petite & regular looked good just a bit tight in the shoulders, since that's how my body is built.  i'm keeping the regular hem version.  my stats for fit reference: 5'3"" 140# 36dd, meaty arms/shoulders/back, small hips, no waist/bum.",1
"I love this dress! the colors work well with my olive skin color, it has pockets and it has a hi-lo front/back.â â i have slim hips so the tie waist is very flattering which gives an hourglass figure.â â i am 5?2?, 116 lbs and a 32d.â â i usually need a petite size because retailer dresses run a little long on me. but i was able to get away with getting an xs regular because of the hi-lo length. it fell perfectly above my knee.",1
"This was a lovely skirt. the colors are beautiful, and the style is not too poofy like other ball skirts.
it is very high waisted, and at 5'8"" the length was similar to the model.",1
"The color says red but it's more like a rust. i'm 5'3"" so it was long and would need to be tailored and the fabric is so thin i was afraid it would rip if it got caught on anything.

finally returned it without it making it out the door :(",0
Beautiful print. agree with other reviewers that the small snap at the bust is inadequate for anyone with a d or greater bust size. the dress was a perfect length on me with heels - even after i kicked off my heels i didn't find it too long like other reviewers. wind does open op the front so i may get it altered so it's no longer a true wrap dress,1
The concept of this sweater is really pretty. my usual size xl fit perfectly; not tight or too loose. the color of the sweater is not like the photo; there is a lot more of a brown tone. by putting the sweater on and taking it off i must have torn a hole because there is a 1 1/2 inch tear in the front where the peplum bottom panel has been felted to the body of the sweater. it literally pulled apart where the two fabrics meet. the other issue i have with the sweater is the area where the front a,1
"Three tops for the price of one.....i fell in love with this top the moment i saw it online. i tried it on as soon as i received it with jeans and it looked just how i hoped it would. not too short, just right. then i tried it on with the buttons in front and just loved how it looked. this can be worn 3 ways......back buttoned, front buttoned and as an unbuttoned throw on over a tank and shorts. recommend this highly for just about any body type..",1
Love the style and fit. great buy! my legs aren't as long as the models however so it falls a bit lower on the knees.,1
"This design looks really sharp on the image, but in reality this jacket felt more like a jacket you would get at forever xxi.  the fabric had that polyester/shiny quality to it that made it look cheap.  since the fabric was pretty soft, with a gray jersey lining, it felt more like a padded jacket than a constructed blazer.  

i also thought the cut was small if you have a bust larger than a b, i felt like i was busting out of a size 8, and i am a 34d.",0
"This dress is even more amazing in person. the beading and embroidery are quite intricate and add a touch of elegance. the kimono like sleeves have the same details - especially nice for toasting!
be aware that the dress is not mid calf but just below the knee- a surprise but still quite lovely. the lines of the dress and exceptional detailing should make this dress a timeless classic. i look forward to wearing it to many occasions when a lbd would be just too expected!",1
Simple blazer with cute details - buttons on the back and lining. this will look good both in the office over over a pair of jeans and booties. i was able to go with the regular size (instead of petite) because i will wear with the sleeve rolled up.,1
I purchased this jacket in my local store. size 10 and runs really small . i love the color combination and design but the fabric in my opinion is poor quality. i have seen a lot of retailer use this poly spun knit in so much of their items and the jacket after bringing it home and looking in the light was already showing pilling. looks like it is worn in an bad way. returned the next day. this was a big disappointment and every time i see this fabric being used in retailer clothes it makes me mad.,0
"I have been watching this skirt and only scooped it up on sale plus promo. it runs small and the size 10 fits like a size 8 would fit . 145 lbs and curvy figure, flat tummy but have hips and tush. the quality is just ok and not worth the full price but on sale it was doable. i love a-line styles and this skirt is different with the fabric stitching at diagonal pieces. it is light weight so i can really see this being worn more in spring and summer and a go to skirt that looks sharp . website pho",1
I want to like and keep. at this price point i cant justify keeping. if it does go to clearance i will reorder. due to the thin material it seems more summery and casual than what i was anticipating. true to size. i ordered a medium and am 5'9 and 155 pounds.,0
"This is the tiniest blazer i've ever purchased in a size 10. i usually wear an 8, but sized up based on other reviews and it was still too small. it's very attractive but please size true to size",0
"I expected this dress to be a much better fit and quality overall--the size small fit me fine--i'm about 140 and small in the chest, but the zipper was incredibly cheap and the dress could've draped in a more attractive way. if this dress could be in cotton and given more consideration to the fit and drape, it'd be worth it, but it's going back.",0
"I bought navy in my usual size s, and the color and fit are exactly as pictured. very good quality cotton. the pocket can lay funny on the hips but a little adjustments does the trick. i wore this chemise at home and hubby noticed it (never happens), i wore it to study in coffee shop with boots and scarf and felt comfortable, warm and stylish. great staple, well made and well priced.",1
"I loved the design of these pants, and got them to go with the matching jacket. the problem with them is there isn't enough stretch to keep them up. i found that thru out the day i was pulling them up, as they would slide down. the pant fabric should have had more stretch or they should have put stronger elastic at the waist.",1
"These are my new favorite pair of jeans. very flattering (particularly on the bum)! the wash is great - dark and slightly distressed, with a frayed hem at the ankle. the leg is straight rather than super skinny, which i am really enjoying as of late. fyi - i am usually a size 29 in denim, but went down to a 28 in this style.",1
This is such a comfy dress and recommend it to anyone. pairs amazing with leather boots and hat,1
I really wanted to like this shirt but it doesn't seem to be of that great of quality and is much more sheer than indicated in the photographs. the shirt is very clingy and doesn't hang well. i sent it back,0
"This blouse drapes nicely. the 8 in the store was too big which is not what i usually find with maeve. i wear a 6 or small in most blouses. i ordered the 6 and it was still too big, so i hope the 4 will work.",1
"I was on the fence about ordering my normal med, but so glad i did. it fits sooo well. i do think its more suited for warmer days since the material is very thin. its sort of a cropped length and looks great with sandals and heels. i don't like showing off bra detail and will add some kind of closure detail to hide bra or wear a very lightweight top underneath. this was a great buy especially with the sale.",1
I originally ordered this blouse to wear for work. i was pleasantly surprised that i could wear it casually with jeans! fits comfortably and hugs my curves!,1
Perfect top! the color is absolutely beautiful and the fit is better than i imagined it would be! love!!!,1
"For reference i am 5'5"" and 118 lbs. the small fits nicely. the style is flattering. i have a big rib age, so as with many back zip styles that area is a bit tight when i sit down. not too bad though. ican wear it to work and out for a date both. colors are a bit subdued but i will enhance the pink or blue floral tones with a sweater, jacket and jewelry.",1
"Cute but not sure it's worth the price point. i might reach for it in sale, and while it was cute on, i just don't spend that much on a daytime casual dress. i'm sure you could dress it up with heels or something but there's something about this dress that screams casual daytime. still very pretty and flattering! i loved the neckline and detailing there",1
"It's a cute idea, but it's so low cut and the material is very thin. i was hoping to wear it as a cool, flowing summer top, but i'll have to layer it since my whole bra basically hangs out of it. i'm only keeping it because it was such a good price. also the buttons are super tiny and a little hard to fasten.",0
"I ordered the stress in an xl. i usually wear a size 12 in most retailer clothes. the pattern and the flow of the dress is very beautiful but it runs extremely small. also, i felt that i was choking. it is better suited for thin women.",0
"I highly recommend this dress! it is super flattering and i got so many compliments. it fits like a glove and honestly made me look 10 lbs thinner. very romantic and has great movement. the length is perfect, since the top is quite modest, it's nice that it's on the shorter side - makes it a little flirty! i wasn't sure of the pattern at first, but it fit so perfectly that i overlooked it and bought it anyway. by the end of the night i was in love with the pattern. it really stood out and i can'",1
This dress is very lightweight and great for fall/spring weddings. i received several compliments all night! sits very nice on the waist as well!,1
"As a beach cover-up this would be great, but i'm surprised retailer calls this a dress and doesn't show on the model how thin it is. it's pretty sheer and i couldn't get away without layering it.",0
"Love the jeans! the color is listed as black for some reason but they are definitely blue like the picture. and what i love most is i've always wanted somewhat distressed jeans but for me the ripped jeans look doesn't work. these are perfectly distressed without being hole-y. i also love the length. i'm usually a 29"" person because i love ankle length for boots (tall and short). these are listed i think a bit shorter than that i think but didn't feel cropped. they are also made of some special """,1
"Love this un-basic white top. it's very flattering on, and i love that it's a versatile piece that can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion. i am usually a size 8 in maeve tops/dresses, but i found a size 6 fit me a bit better in this particular top. if your'e in between sizes, you may need to size down. i definitely recommend this top!",1
"Just fab. great length, great pattern, flattering fit, and even pockets!!",1
"Material is thin, with a fleece like feeling on the inside. hard to describe but almost feels like a really thin north face material. the cut on the sides of chest area is super awkward, shows way too much, would never be appropriate to wear a regular bra underneath.",0
"I love workout dresses and skirts. i sport them in both yoga (if they have an under layer of shorts, obviously) and in high cardio classes-as well as for things like tennis. i like the extra breeze a dress/skirt will get you, and find them to be really comfortable. i really like this dress as it is not a super bold color (it is hard to find workout attire that is not neon colored). i prefer things to be a little more relaxed and less ""look at me"" like when i am working out. this dress is flatter",1
"I love a crisp white poplin blouse and this top is perfect in that role. i am between a small and medium in retailer tops. because this top looked a little bell in the model photos, i decided to order a 6. it was a bit snug across the chest. for reference, i am a 34c. i returned it for the 8 and it fit perfect. i'm not sure why this top was offered during the winter because it will likely hang in my closet until april. highly recommend this blouse for summer.",1
"While the styling is cute, the fit was poor under the arms and there was quite a gap. i returned this.",0
"36dd, 10/12 in tops, 12/14 in bottoms
this is a wonderfully soft and warm sweater. the pink color is heathered with some grey and goes with just about any neutral bottom. the neckline was a little fiddly when i first tried it on, however like one of the previous reviewers i folded the left side under a bit to make an asymmetrical cowl neck, and it lays very nicely and looks great. runs a little big, i tried the medium and it fits perfectly. another great sweater from moth!",1
"Love this. i adore pilcro, great for us gals who have thick hips, thighs and a slim waist. they fit tts and are a great staple for fall. the color says dark orange but they are as pictured, a perfect dark tan. i wish that retailer would buy more size 33 in all pilcro. they always sell out fast and i am always out of luck unless i find them when they first come out. also, please make a full length boyfriend jean pilcro! love.",1
"I normally wear a medium with these types of fabrics but this one was oddly proportioned on me. the skirt was also not very flattering to my hourglass figure, but it at least fit well. the top was baggy and gaped at the armpits as stated by others. i really wanted to like this dress but it made me look 20 pounds heavier even in the places it looked too big on me. i could have tried going with a small but the skirt would have then been too short.",0
"I haven't owned a skort in years! this one is super cute and so soft! i love the details, the asymmetrical cut and the buckles. i bought it in olive green. it fits really well. i'm 5'5"" 119 lbs with an athletic frame and i purchased a size 2 (my normal size). it fits comfortably around my waste and thighs/but with some wiggle room. 

i'm wearing it today w/ a navy blue/cream floral tank top, white/navy striped vans, and a gold dangly necklace. i love that its a versatile item and i'm looking f",1
"Agree with other poster. this shirt runs very big. i'm all for a flowy, shirt that hides my belly but this is just a tent. i'll be retuning it.",0
"This top is very soft and well made. for my short and curvy figure, it is very unflattering. i considered altering it, but there is no way to do it. it gapes in the front and if you have a waist at all, it won't show because this top is boxy and full in that area. if you are tall and slim, it might be perfect, so give it a try.",0
"So, this dress is extremely comfortable, but it's just really awkward. i am on the fence about keeping it, my husband loves it and thinks i should. it just draws attention to the belly, so any issues after having kids, is very noticeable. not to mention the huge cutouts for the arms. very comfortable, but not sure if i will keep it.",0
"I wanted to love this top! on me it was weirdly boxy. it was too wide and too short, and it was more sheer than i expected it. the fabric is lightweight but wrinkles really easy and loses shape pretty quickly. i also thought the fabric would be heavier and have more structure than it has. i love the scalloped detail at the arms but after about five minutes of wear this felt super crumpled and just kind of sloppy. unfortunately it will be going back.",0
"I purchased the dusty rose. i thought the picture represented the color accurately. the shirt material had a nice thickness and drape. it felt very luxurious. the opening in the front is cut a little low but workable.

in the end i am disappointed in the care information provided by the site. it listed the garment as machine washable but the care label in the garment states it is dry clean only. i would not have purchased it if i would have know that. i am going to have to return it for this rea",0
"I bought this in the mauve in my usual size small. i think this sweater is intentionally big and slouchy, so i would say it runs true to size. it is very soft and the weave is airy--not going to be warm enough for a below freezing day but i love the style. the neckline is a bit fussy but i think you just have to wear it and let it fall the way it wants to. the sleeves are long enough to cover your hands. the sweater, when pulled all the way down, covers my butt and half my thighs (and i'm 5'9"" t",1
"I mentioned the sizing is true to size but it should be important to note that they will loosen throughout the day, so when i order another color i will size down one size. the color is as pictured too. 
these are great for casual and business casual wear. so comfortable and perfect and flattering for my shape, athletic with muscular thighs.
can't wait to order another pair.",1
"True to size i found. got the medium and had a bit of room to spare. usually i'm a 6 on the lower half, (34-28-36).
the upper portion is a very very light heathered grey, almost cream and yes, i found it to be see through.
comfortable but either for lounging round the house only or wear a tunic to cya!",1
"This sweater is incredibly soft and pretty, but there is just no way to get it to lay the way the model does in the picture. i found myself constantly tugging at the top to get it to stay off the shoulder - otherwise it just bunched up top and make a weird funnel neck. i really wanted it to work, but it was just so impractical.",0
"The sweater runs large, the sweater is designed in such a way that it looks very sloppy. i would never be able to wear it out of the house. however, the material is exceptionally soft and delightful. keeping as its a great stay at home & lounge sweater, but way over priced for this purpose. if you can get the fabric to lay correctly, you're a genius.",0
"I loved the cut and the stretch in the material made them comfortable, however i found that the material was unflattering for thicker thighs because it tended to cling to the body. it would have been better with some sort of lining as it would have prevented the flimsy material from highlighting imperfections. bottom of pants are not hemmed, so if you want a clean look, you may not like the edges. these were returned immediately as it just did not work for me.",0
"I wanted to like this sporty dress too. i teach at an elementary school and like to get down on my knees st my students level - plus we can get messy most days with our learning and most days are go - go - go being ""on"" every second...the armholes were cut too big and weirdly squared. i didn't like the middle ""ridge"" either as it was unflattering. it was returned.",0
"I am usually a 4 in maeve tops, but i sized up to a 6. i am 5'7"" 127 lbs. it is a crisp white, comfortable, easy to wear tank that requires some ironing or steaming. it doesn't look like much in the photo, but once i saw it in person and tried it on, it was an easy decision to make the purchase. it is feminine and has a pronounced a-line shape to it.",1
I normally wear a large to medium but due to other reviews i ordered a med and could've worn a small. i still love it and i'm so glad i ordered.,1
"Super flattering fit. i am generally a large, large, and the medium of this shirt fit really well. the drape of the fabric was very forgiving of my tummy. great look. also my 1 year old son loves the colors and flowers!",1
"Taking the sweater out of the package i was kind of skeptical because of the shape, but to my surprise it looks like as it does on the model. it does take a minute to figure out how to wear it. i ordered the medium (normally wear a size 8) and is a little long, but goes with my personal style. i love the idea of being able to wear it out without looking frumpy or comfy at home.",1
"The model must have this sweater pinned at the back. the sweater color is true and the material soft as anything, but the fit is ??!! at 5'9"" with a long torso and broad shoulders, the large was still shlumpy. didn't hang right at all, bunches oddly and is not the least bit flattering. my 5'7"" uber fit daughter had the same issue, and she usually makes everything that doesn't work for me look amazing. returned.",0
"Get creative with the neckline or let it fall where ever. this is a purposefully slouchy, uber casual, super soft",1
"This top is amazing. it's a little stretchy but doesn't cling and it's surprisingly flattering on my curvy figure. i have a large chest and the shirt fits perfectly with or without a cami underneath. the material is very soft and the print is vibrant and fun. the shirt does run a little large. the only slight issue i have is that it is a little shorter than i usually like on my long torso. other than that, it's pretty much perfect.",1
"This dress had a nice silhouette, but the armholes were cut a bit wide and made it look sloppy- too bad - it would've made a nice casual dress!",0
"Usually i really like deletta and know the sizing and shapes. this top looked pretty in the pics and i thought it would be a nice change from a tee. it was baggy, hung low and the layers just looked boxy and shapeless.",0
"Love this skort. bought it in green in store and am now going to get it in black on line. fairly true to size maybe on the lightly larger side. soft, well made and comfortable! bought size 4, am 5'5"" 110lbs",1
I love this sweater! it is so comfortable and lightweight. i am always warm and i can see myself wearing this sweater without getting overheated. very flattering as well :-),1
This is a pretty sweater that is great for transitioning to fall. wear it sleeveless on throw a leather jacket over it for cooler nights. fights true to size. the gray is a very pretty color. great addition to my wardrobe!,1
"I love this top. it's so soft and the cut is so flattering for a sweater! the sleeve holes are low enough so that you could easily layer underneath it but high enough to be work alone. the knit is a perfect fall thickeness...warm but not too thick. i am 5'11"" 130lbs and i got the medium for the extra length.",1
"While i love the design and shape of this blouse, the fabric was of very poor quality. i will return it.",0
"Extremely cute sweater, but after having worn it twice it's already pilling up. i'd expect more for a $100 sweater.",0
"Gorgeous material, great length for tall girls, warm without being too heavy, super soft. i ordered the grey and white in small and have returned them for extra-small. i feel like they run a bit big though i seemed to have gone down a size at retailer in the past year, not sure if its vanity sizing. this is a classic sweater and a timeless staple - elegant and sophisticated. the grey is that nice soft grey that doesn't wash a fair complected person out and is flattering with all complexions. great",1
This is a great transition piece. wear with jeans or dress it up with a cute skirt.,1
This is the most fabulous sweater ever. i really hesitated spending $368 for a sweater but this sweater is worth every dime! it is soft and luxurious. i tried it over a cashmere cable knit dress and it looks unbelievable -- i also tried it over jeans and it looks equally as good. if it came in another color - i'd buy it too.,1
"Nice fitting, pretty and feminine. looks great with skinny jeans/leggings and boots. good in spring, fall and winter!",1
"This dress is just too baggy overall. i am 5'6"" 140 lbs and a size small was so unflattering. i can't go down in size because the waist detail will get too high on me. it was already a little high on the small.",0
"I ordered this top in red based on one of the reviews. it is more like marroon. i am very disappointed. the top itself is plain cotton and not that great quality. it is long and has the belt at the back, but the fit and quality overall are very plain. it looks a tad dowdy. i am still keeping it because i got it on sale and i can wear it at home with lounge leggings. but it is definitely not dressy. perhaps white may not look as bad. the plain design and marroon dull color don't help.",0
"I know you cannot tell from the pictures, but the fabric on this is incredible. it is very light and extremely airy so that it flows when you walk. i am a rather petite individual so it would require excessive tailoring for me to wear this-both in length and in the top. i think it was true to size with this exception-and i wish they offered this in petite. i would have tailored the length if it was only that, but on the top (i am not large-chested) there was a bunch of extra fabric that just lai",1
"I saw this one for the first time today in-store and was not impressed. it is a lacey material with an under-layer, so with a different cut other than a swing dress i would have fallen in love and it would have been absolutely gorgeous. unfortunately, i did not like the swing dress cut, especially not in white. i wasn't sure if the designer was going for a throw back to the 70s or a shortened version of my grandmother's wedding gown, but either way it was not working for me. to be fair, swing dr",0
"I'm pregnant (2nd trimester) and really wanted a beautiful, non-maternity dress. i got this in ivory and it's just perfect. the lace on the sleeves is really comfortable, i love the fit, and i love the length. i got tons of compliments on it. my only regret is that i didn't also get it in slate and i really wishing it would get re-stocked.",1
"I was hoping that this would be a nice neutral layering staple but it simply leaves a lot to be desired. it fits tts, length is fine...the inside is some, but the outside darker material is stiff and cheap (kinda canvas feeling?). the material is super stiff which makes it flare out like like a tent in a super unflattering way. it also is on the thinnish side - it looks in the model shot like it would be a little thicker and warm. this is definitely going back.",0
"I ordered ths thinking it was likea blazer, but it is soft and not structured, like a t-shirt. however, it is rather flattering on. i had a har dtime deciding whether to keep it. the regular size was fine on me, i usually require peites, but this doesn't come in petites, and it was really nice with the fitted cowl shirt i was wearing. i am definitely putting it back in my wish list (as i did end up returning).",1
"I don't normally write reviews, but i purchased this dress in white in 3 different sizes and each dress had the same flaw. the hems were very uneven on all three. this dress was poorly sewn. it's a shame because it looked awesome online. i was very disappointed!!!!!",0
"So i'm not sure if its just my body type or what, but this did nothing for me. the bottom, which i thought would be too big was actually too small in both the small and the medium (i'm a size 8 bottom) and then when i sized up to the medium it was still too tight and then the top was loose. i just think this one is going to take the right body type. it could look really beautiful on the right person, just not me.",0
"These are the perfect pants for the hourglass figure, i needed sz 4 but the store was sold out in my sz plan to order . these pants are light weight and fit in all the right spots , don't show any flaws on legs and i do have them ,but they are very complimentary to my figure . they are also really hip without being over the top or weird.",1
"Great news if you missed out on this tank last year! this s the exact style and cut as last season's buttondown tank released by c&s. 

super flattering fit, not too poofy. it *is* semi-open in the back and the slit goes as high as the last button. super sweet for summer and goes with virtually everything. i reeeeally wish they had this one in more colorways. it's grrrrr8!

for reference i'm 5'6"" 103lbs 34a 25 in jeans and i tried on an xs. last year i purchased an xxs petite and it fits exa",1
"I think this will work well on very busty hourglass figures,or very petite frames; but on my athletic build this shirt did me no favors. i have one of those body types where my biceps are very muscular, and my shoulders are broader than my hips (w/a 34b chest). i typically take a m or a l in most retailer tops, and, had i kept this, i would have gone with the m.

"Love this dress! fits tts. great fitted slip underneath beautiful lace design. i'm 5'6"" the dress (size small), hits right above my knees. very versatile dress, may be dressed up or down depending on shoes",1
"I saw this dress in our store and immediately walked over to check it out. it is quite a stunning piece. i purchased it without trying it on and wished i would have. unfortunately, there is entirely too much material in the bodice. it was overwhelming on me. for reference i am 5 ""3 and i do wear an xs but i am muscular and not thin. i think it would work well on somebody taller or leggier who could balance out the amount of material in the dress.",0
I love maeve but this shirt's quality was poor and it was not worth the price. i would not recommend buying this online. you really need to try the blouse on in the store to make the decision as to if its worth purchasing or not...... and in my case this is being sent back.,0
I have this dress in white and i have worn it twice for completely different events. i wore it with red heels for a dressy look and then with boots and a jean jacket for a more casual look. i am only 5'4'' and it hit above my knees. it's a soft white that is appropriate for winter wear. love it!,1
"Fun outerwear for the fall. the color is a bit more grey than the photo shows (at least on my screen), but i still think it'll go with a lot.",1
"I got a size xxsp which is perfect although i usually wear a xs petite or xs. i'm 5'2"", currently 33-25-37, 30d/32c bra, with narrow shoulders and torso, a bit long-waisted. the ribbed darby sweater hugs every single curve without being tight. low cut, but not as low as on the model; very flattering neckline. sleeves end about an inch above my elbows and can be folded up.

"Very flattering. fits tts. love the colors. does not give any lift up or support to breasts.i am a 36 c and i was fine with this. it is so flattering to back and overall a flattering fit i was ok with my breast not being supported and uplifted. if you want support this is not for you. it does look exactly as it does on model in regard to coverage showing some cleavage but very little. i am 5'6"" 127 lbs and not very fit and took a medium. my husband really loves this suit and gave it two big thum",1
"This top could've been one of my favorites ever. i ordered the rose option and was planning on ordering another color. the fabric is super thin but i was able to wear w/o an extra tank. unfortunately after 2 wears, several small holes appeared around the neck/under the ruffle. i washed this top on hand wash cycle and hung to dry. when i came to read the reviews, i noticed i wasn't the only customer with this issue.",0
I ordered xs/petite but i think i better ordered xxs which was already sold out at the time i purchased. i recommend one size smaller for this sweater. this sweater is designed very wide for your shoulder which could be fallen down for people who usually prefer petite size but it's really adorable!!,1
"I had originally bought this top in one of your stores and loved it!!! got sooo many compliments!!! while reading my e-mail one night, i saw it on sale!! of course i would have bought it anyway!!! now i have 2 of my favorite tops!!!",1
"I ordered the blue dress because i loved the color and unique design. the blue was much more of a dark navy, not a sapphire blue as it looks in the picture. the picture also shows it tying on the side. it did not tie on the side when i tried it on but in the front as pictured in the red version of the dress. it was not at all flattering on me. one of the few disappointing things i have ordered from retailer.",0
"The design is cute, but there is way too much fabric in the lower part of the shirt. also, the fabric for the lower part crumples easily. unless you carry around an iron, you may not want to wear it outside the house. i kept the shirt to wear around the house.",0
So lovely.  perfect print / graphic.  want to buy in both colors but the yellow is perfection.,1
"This is a very nice, flattering thing which can be worn as a dress or a shirt. therefore decided tiokeep it.",1
"The back of this top is nice but it is very flowy. i ordered a small (32dd, normally a 4/6 in retailer tops) -- a smaller size would fit better but is not available. overall nice, but wish it came in a smaller size.",1
"Very soft material, length is great, a little more loose than i would have liked.",1
"This is a perfect change of seasons into cooler (colder!) months piece. 

colors 
the colors are muted, the pattern is modern and stylish, the cut flattering. 

sizing
the sizing is generous, and fit is easy. love length, which is true to the product photo- fitting at about the bottom of my fingertips. i love the coverage without looking too covered.

quality 
it's soft, a great weight ---and the quality seems good. i have already worn it a few times and it is not one of those sweaters",1
I ordered the yellow color way expecting it to be a mustard color. it seemed to have a greenish tint to it and didn't look right on me. also the pockets didn't lay right so the flower didn't look right.,0
"First, i did not notice the description mentioning metallic thread. i was disappointed when i opened the box to find it is a metallic, but actually i'm glad i didn't know because i love it. it does not look cheap and it really works. the pale peachy color is gorgeous and the metallic is subtle enough. the real issue for me is the size. i ordered the small and it is huge. enormous. especially from the back. the seam on the sleeve is just above my elbow so it's almost a bat wing kind of thing and",1
"I ordered both colors in the xxs p knowing that size goes fast. i used to wear xs or xs petite consistently, but this last year, i have found myself needing the smaller size (vanity sizing?) in this case, the xxs p was perfect for me, length was around mid-thigh (could almost wear as a dress if i were younger and not as muscular in my thighs), the waist and chest are fitted but not snug (fitted in the sense that it follows my natural curves). the flower patterns are so cute, it does cut at the p",1
"This shirt is versatile for work and fun. my sister has this shirt and thought it was so cute, i ordered it too.",1
"Love this vest. it is super soft and cozy yet fits and lays well. not bulky, so it's a great piece to layer over flannels. it has a bit of stretch.",1
"I love the looks of this sweater on the model! after receiving it, it was still very pretty and stylish to look at. my problem is that i am petite, and the sweater seemed to run very large. it wasn't very fitted. i think the detailing in the back would look better fitted. it made me look rather dowdy and/or matronly unlike how it looks on the model. i think that was because it was just too big. i returned it.",1
"I purchased this sweater in red, it's a deep, rich color and although i usually opt for black, you can see the beautiful details on this sweater much better in the red. i love this item!",1
"This was another unusual choice for a larger busted woman like myself, but i couldn't say no to that sweet little back detail. i'll attack the waist with a cropped jacket. for those looking to add volume or flowy fabric, you've found your answer and then some!",1
The green color was beautiful but the top was too low cut and looked more maternity than boho.,0
Some of the reviews about this being cheap fabric made me nervous about purchasing...but i did and i love it! the material isn't super thick but i like that as i tend to run hot. it's super soft material and feels good on!!,1
"I tried this on and think it will look great with leggings and boots. it's very flattering without being too tight or too baggy. some of retailer's clothes are just too full and baggy for me and make me look large. i am 5'4"" 140 lbs and ordered the medium which fits perfectly. i ordered both the navy and yellow, but the yellow has not arrive yet.",1
Cute design and interesting back feature. runs a little big and is comfortable and flowy.,1
"This is absolutely a 1-season top. the material is very thin and flowy, with the front v plunging pretty dramatically. i'm using mine as a swim cover, and i'm thrilled to report the mottled pattern on the cotton hides perspiration(!)
the first time i wore this top, i paired it with denim shorts, and the hemline completely covered the shorts, so it was way more of a mini-dress than a long shirt--which is ok. if i wear it again as a top rather than a swim cover, i'd just go with yoga shorts benea",1
"After reading all the reviews i thought i would have to size up. went into my local retailer and found this dress in a size 4 burnt orange color (last one in stock). it was still marked $79 so i think thats why it was still there.. i crossed my fingers and tried it on, it fit perfect! not to short or tight in the upper sleeve. i'm 5'4"" so maybe that's why the lenght was fine on me. if you can find this in your local store try it on. it's really cute and comfortable. i also have the front lace up j",1
"I wanted to love this dress. i saw it in the catalog in blue, and wanted it. however, for some reason i took my sweet time in ordering it, and by the time i did, only the orange was available: but on sale. i was so excited when it arrived, and as i was trying it on, i thought, this is a bit shorter in the skirt than i usually go but it's so pretty... and then i couldn't get my right arm in the sleeve at all. i wondered if i had caught some of the lining as i was putting it on or something, but n",0
"I love the idea of this top, but wish there wasn't so much fabric. i am wearing a medium in the photos and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40.",0
I love the look of this dress and the material - the problem is that when i tried it on the fit was a bit off. it seems that the arm holes hung down way too much and pulled the dress so it is uncomfortable to wear. i don't think i could have gone down or up a size to make this dress work. it is a shame because i really liked the look of it.,0
This is an awesome pointelle sweater. i love angel of the north sweaters. i bought the small (34b) and it fit tts. the pleats in the back hang without pulling. it also flatters the figure with it's shaping. it is a lightweight sweater in a great shade of red. just love it!,1
"Bought this shirt on sale. it was super cute in the dressing room, and for the first time i wore it. washed it per the instructions (wash delicate with cold water, lay flat to dry) and it shrunk so much i don't think i'm going to be able to wear it anymore. it was oversized and loose when i bought it, so it shrunk a lot. there is also a small hole all of the sudden, that i have no idea where it came from (wasn't there when i put it in the washer). very disappointed.",0
"This is the cutest sweater. i bought it today in black. i cannot wait to wear it. it is a lovely, distinctive knit & just the right weight to layer as shown with a white blouse or with a turtleneck. i tried both the xs and s; and i decided to go with the s as it still emphasized that i have waist, but i could layer it nicely. i am 5'4"", 130 lb. you can always count on angel of the north for great style.",0
"As much as i wanted to love this top, it was too flowy and and i felt like i looked bigger than i am (i'm a size 6). maybe a smaller size would have made a big difference.",0
"Just picked this up at my retailer and i just love it. its totally different than your typical tee. the bottom is more of a blousy silk material and the top is a super soft knit. it lays really well and is long enough to wear with leggings! my favorite part is the t strap in the back. such a beautiful detail and so much fun. my only criticism with this top is where it hits on the bust. im a little more full figured, so the top looks better on me when the silk part isn't under my boobs. kinda have",1
"I likded this but tried it in two sizes and it was still too big in the armpit. my bra showed. i am about a d cup, smallish in other proportions (125, 5'6"") and no bra worked with this so that i wouldn't have to worry about my bra showing. nice fabric and drape. maybe good for someone who doesn't need a bra?",0
"Love the style of this vest, and an added bonus is how soft it is. every vest is different, though, so if you're shopping in the store, be sure to look at all of them.",1
"I tried both the xs/s and the m/l and found the larger size to be more roomy in the shoulders, and just swish a bit better around the hips. this is a change from many long vests my closet, which tend to be size small or medium, as are my blouses and tops. however, could happily live with either size and color, gorgeous.",1
"This sweater is the reason i shop at retailer - unique, cute & comfy! the yellow really isn't 'one of my colors' but it's so different that i had to get it. and the cut is so flattering, that i had to go back to get the purple! it may run a tad bit generously; i'm 5'4"", 124 lbs, 34d and originally got the small. i wound up returning and getting the xs. that sizing was slightly more form-fitting, without being clingy.we had a hint of fall weather in colorado, so i immediately threw the yellow versi",1
"Very pretty top. the fabric is wonderful! i enjoy the movement and the style. only downside is that it is cut a little low for me. but it does look great and the fit is, otherwise, perfect",1
"It's a fine dress, but it definitely runs small, and it's actually a lot shorter than i was expecting, especially since i'm only 5' 3""",0
"I am petite with somewhat broad shoulders. iusually wear 2 or 2p dresses. i ordered a 2 and it was tight in the shoulders & hip. otherwise this is a cute dress, looks better on the person than in pictures. the tie is an interesting twist on an otherwse basic shirtdress. the fabric drapes nicely on the body, i reordered dress in a 4. inever wear size4. hopefully it's not too big or long.",1
"Perfect light weght sweater for the holidays. i love the detail in the back. the xs was a great fit for this 5'2"", 115 lb body.",1
This was so large on me that it looked awful. huge armholes and a baggy mess. material was nice and i loved the design. not sure a smaller size would even help.,0
"When i first saw this in the store, i loved the idea of this shirtdress with a twist. i tried it on in my usual size 4 but could not get it over my 32d bust. i wrote it off and moved on. back in the store shopping for a party dress, i saw this was now on sale. although not right for the party, i decided to try it in a bigger size. a size 6 was not available but a size 8 was. perfection! if you are willing to size up, you will be rewarded with a comfortable, versatile dress that can be super casu",1
"First, the product arrived in a very small bag that made for many, many wrinkles - almost impossible to determine what it might look like. shame on retailer for sending their items in this manner. secondly, i don't know how individuals wear this with a bra. the back is cut so low that my bra back band partially showed - not my idea of a good look. third, the front necessitated a cami, and there is no way a cami can be worn due to how it is cut in the back. returning now, and i just received it.",0
"This super cute sweater is comfy and fun to wear.  i love it as much as last years wool paned sweater tunic, except this sweater is too short on me to wear as a dress.  wonderful with leggings and boots.  i bought the blue in size m regular and my stats are: 63""t/39""c/28""w/35""h/30""i (tall/chest/waist/hips/inseam)",1
"Love this sweater! not too long or bulky,true to size. the fabric is super soft, great quality!",1
"I first saw this top earlier in the year. i watched for it to go on sale and it finally did over the labor day holiday + 40% off. i was very happy about that. it runs a tiny bit big. i got the s. i wonder if the xs would have been better but i kept the small because of the price and how cute it looked on. it looks gray online but it is more greenish gray. it has a cute back detail, too. it looks cute with jeans and gray pants. it is just cute and different than most of my other tops.",1
"This top is very cute. the fit is great and the material is very comfortable. i am a 5'7, 135 lbs and wear a 36d and the medium fit great!",1
"I loved everything about this dress. the fit, the style and the ability to wear in the fall. i wore it once, washed it in gentle/hand-wash cycle, in cold water and laid it out flat to dry- per the instructions- and it shrank at least a full size. it's going back. i am so sad, as i said earlier, i really loved this dress.",0
"I bought this dress online to wear to work and i did not expect anything too impressive based on the picture of the model. i am really surprised at how beautiful, well-fitting, and soft this dress is. i am in love. it fits snugly, but the fabric is so thick that it is still very office appropriate (i work at a law firm). i ordered the small petite and it comes to the top of my knees.",1
"The fabric, colors and concept are fabulous but the pleating is overdone is it looks huge not swingy!
i am 5' 9"" and 135lbs. and even an x-small was too billowy to be cute. too bad- it's otherwise so great!",0
"When i tried it on, it was a bit shapeless, but it was on a promo so i decided to get it. i kind off like shapeless. i've worn it three times and washed it gently in the machine as recommended (in a lingerie bag, always) and air dried it. it now has a huge rip on the sleeve seam, and i cannot see how this happened. the inner lining is soft and substantial  but the outer gauze layer is thin.",0
"I love the photo of this and because the reviews were so positive i ordered it. i was shocked when i opened the package. first, the fabric is not the silky rayon cotton blend i was expecting. it looks and feels more like a cheap cotton. it does not have the drape or feel or look i expect in a kimono, which brings me to the second disappointment. it is not a kimono at all. it has no kimono sleeve, no sleeves at all in fact. just a slit in the side of the body of the garment you put your arm throu",0
"I tried on the refgular xs and it fit, btu the cut was wring on me, i moved up the dress as though it was cut ""petite"" and what a difference! i will ahve to roder the petite for sure.

te material is a thicker knit, very strectchy and warm enough to carry the dress through winter and spring.

"Review title says almost all. add to that that it is age appropriate, unlike other kedia dresses, for the very young. just too cute for words. i have all of the other tk peasant dresses and although youthful they are appropriate for anyone young of heart. this however, on an older woman, looks ridiculous. i would have liked it for those 9 months but even then it would cover quadruplets!",0
I was really excited when i ordered this dress for na upcoming beach vacation but was very disappointed when i finally saw it in person. it reminded me of those christmas nightgowns from the 90s with the red and white ruffles. pass!,0
"I love these jeans. i am normally a 25 so i went with a 25 petite. i'm 5'4"" and the length was perfect. the 25 was a little big so i'm going to order the 24 petite and compare. they r a great material and very stretchy",1
"These are the very stretchy, almost spongy, type fabric.  i ordered my usual size and they fit me like a sausage skin.  crazy small!!!",0
"This is a really beautiful kimono. soft and flattering. as well as eye catching.
can be dressed up or down.
absolutely recommend",1
Love this sweater. the hi-low length is fun. the elbow length sleeves are great. wish retailer offered more colors! low part of the sweater is a touch clingy at first but stretches well. works well with jeans or leggings. overall perfect layering piece for all seasons.,1
"I ordered this on sale in blue as i had missed it online. i wore it this week during our heat spurt in cali and was shocked how incredible comfy and cute this was with my skinny jeans. it was perfect for the warm day, as well as the snapping evening meeting i had to attend on an outdoor patio... i will love wearing this from spring into summer. i do hope they bring it back as i would love the beige too!.",1
Loved the colors but the fit was less to be desired. very wide under arms & too much material. looks more like a maternity dress. i ordered a small petite & would have needed the xs but now it is no longer available. oh well. returning this.,0
"Wanted to love this dress as it's perfect for transition. i'm a curvy gal who usually sports an xl in dresses at retailer, and unfortunately this one was way too big even for me to pull off. my boyfriend actually guffawed when he saw me in it. i would implore the maker to try this style again as it's a good one, unfortunately the sizing was it's downfall.",0
"I love the design, that's why i'm going back for a smaller size. i bought a medium and that size was made for someone 50 lbs heavier than i. usually i'm good at choosing my size online, but not today. if you are curvy and round like me still go for a smaller size because this dress has a lot if room. also i wish more clothes would come into the stores to try on, please!",0
"I'm short, only 5ft and this is beautiful and flowy. it's just below my knees and i think it's perfect. i have only worn it twice out and literally everywhere i went i received a compliment, and asking where i got it. it's unique and no one else carries one like this. i know some customers mentioned the price being a bit high but i disagree. i would rather pay for something that i love, that has good design and quality instead of 50 or 60 for a so so product. that's what i love about retailerpolog",1
"This dress was cute in the photos but wore like a sack when i put it on. great quality, fabric was lovely, just a little sparkle at the hemline, scallops were great but i put it on, i immediately took it back off and put it back in the sack to return. love the look, it just was terrible on me. i'm petite, 5'0"" and weigh 110# so i'm not large but the dress made me look like an oompaloompa.",0
"I bought this (because it looks beautiful, is well made, and a high quality piece). when i got it home and tried it on, it did not achieve the look i was going for (boho). instead, it was very drapery and full and big and i felt like i was wearing a ghost costume on halloween. i do love retailer's kimonos and thought i'd love this one. but it's going back. i don't need any more clothes in my closet that i do not absolutely love and want to wear again and again. that is my new criteria for purchasi",0
"I couldn't wait to get this dress! i bought it and was instantly disappointed when i took it out of the bag. while the fabric was beautiful, the sizing was way off. this dress claims to be 35"" long, and i could tell instantly it wasn't. it barely covered my rear. i also know it's supposed to be flowy, but it was really, really wide. i can see this working for someone around 5 feet tall who is wider.",0
I love this sweater and don't think the pics do it justice. i ordered the light blue/lavender color and couldn't be happier. it's great with leggings or jeans and booties or boots. i received many compliments the one time i've worn it so far. so glad to have snagged this on sale but i wouldn't have hesitated to pay full price!,1
"This tank is fairly soft and fits true to size. i like that i can pick between a v or round neck, depending on my outfit. it truly offers a profile to layer with anything. the only complaint i have is that the edging wears faster than the rest of the tank. i've trimmed some pilling off of it to keep it looking neat. otherwise, this is one of my favorite tanks, and i have purchase two more so i can always find one when i want it. 

this tank has some stretch, so i imagine it fits a range of siz",1
"This is a lightweight knit dress that is well-designed but very form-fitting. i decided to return it because at almost 40 there are parts of my body that i don't need to show, but if you're in great shape or willing to wear shape wear, this would be super cute.",1
I am very surprised by the low reviews of this dress. this dress is obviously a very loose fitting style. it is a bit of a man repellar dress.the quality of the fabric is beautiful and the pattern stunning. i find the loose flowy style liberating and comfortable. i love it with otk boots and tights for winter but also planning to wear with sandals in spring. i am 125lbs and purchased the petite small.,1
"This may be lovely on some people but it didn't work on me at all. i thought it would have some swing to it but the bottom hem was tight. if i had gone up a size, the top would have been huge. the bib wasn't flattering on me and it's also quite sheer. too bad because the print is great. maybe if you're athletic with slim hips you can manage it. i think if you are busty this could look like maternity wear on you. back it went, sadly.",0
"The color, heft, style & quality are perfect. i did go down one size since my usual size was too large in the waist.",1
I tried this on at the store - the fuzzy trim around the bib is adorable and the overall texture with little puffs woven into the fabric has a nice quality feel to it. the pattern of flamingos is fun and the fabric is soft. it does run on the big and flowy side. i thought it was very cute and comfy but ultimately did not buy it because the price is rather high and the petite length is sold out. i'll snap it up if it goes on sale.,1
"I just bought these jeans today & they are really cute & comfortable on. i love pilcro jeans as they fit really well, they are made well & they are always on style. i did have to go down a size as well but they fit beautifully! comfy & stylish!",1
"Pretty top online - okay in person. runs small, especially on bottom hemline. thought it would have a swing to it. it does not. more sheer in person than i thought it would be. that wouldn't stop me from keeping it though. it was the way it laid on my chest that was unflattering. looked like i was wearing a bib. i don't have a large chest, just weird look on me. unfortunate, because it is an adorable print. top made for thinner or a petite lady.",0
Very soft color and soft to touch. the material is light and airy and it feels great on. i wear a medium and bought the small. i would definitely buy this in another pattern if they made it as cute as the flamingos.,1
"I saw this skirt online and loved the vibrant colors, pattern, and style. it looks even prettier in person. the material is light and soft. the skirt is fully lined so you don't have to worry about it being see-through. also, the skirt is a good length for me and won't drag on the floor. happy with purchase. recommend.",1
"This top is really cute and i love the design. however, the first time i wore it, the waste band started unraveling.",0
"I really love this top! it is soft, lightweight, and really pretty. it has quickly become one of my favorites!",1
"This is a lovely skirt that fits well, but it is much more of a yellowy cream color than white. also, it felt very static-y.",0
"Very cute coat but could not keep it for the price...just not sure it is worth almost $200,00 (with tax added to cost). when it goes on sale, i will most likely buy it.",1
"I saw this skirt online and had to have it. as another reviewer mentioned, the color is more of a yellowy ivory. the skirt is very pretty, but also has a very thick/heavy satin polyester lining. i don't feel like i could wear it during the summer because the thick poly lining wouldn't breathe. that was the deciding factor and sadly i'll have to return it.",0
"I really liked this dress. it's so comfy, i could sleep in it plus it's quite flattering. however, if you have a tummy, which i do, you have to really suck it in. the dress will show bulges but the layers make it a little more forgiving that the typical fitted dress. the length is great and conservative enough that i wore it to work today, though it does ride up as you walk. the blue is dark enough it could almost be worn with black shoes, almost. the top is really cut well with the perfect neck",1
I totally thought this was a dress when i tried it on and bought it in the store. there is a drawstring on the inside to cinch the waist making it look so cute as a dress.,1
This shirt is so cute in the picture but not so great in person. i bought the short sleeve version this summer and loved it! this runs really big so maybe a smaller size will help.,0
"This dress is so soft and comfortable. i love shift dresses and find them flattering. this one did not disappoint in that area. it is long enough for work and hits just above my knee. finally, the colors are great. the shades of blue, muted red and peachy pink are lovely.",1
"I'm 5' tall and 95 pounds and ordered this in an xxsp.  it's a little loose but still looks really attractive on my body.  it's warmer and thicker than i thought it would be and lined.  i love it!  taller petites might want to size into regular because even on my super-petite body it hit a few inches above the knees - perfect length for me but will hit higher for those taller.
it's going to become a staple!",1
I bought the blue & white one and it is so very comfortable! it will look with my blue jeans and in the summer with my white leggings! great quality at a good price.,1
"Love the knit, color, texture--but oddly a short and boxy fit...and so...not flattering.",0
"Flattering cut, perfect for work or play. even better yet, it was on sale! if they had it in other colors i would buy it! beautiful high-quality garment like all the others i have purchased at retailer!!!",1
This  is more of a cover up than something you would wear out .,0
"I absolutely loved the idea of an elongated hoodie as a lounge dress or robe. unfortunately, this particular product left a lot to be desired. firstly, the fit is slim, not relaxed. i'm 5'4"", at 110 lbs and tried both the size 1 (equivalent of a small) and size 2 (equivalent of a medium). sizing up just added length and did not do much to increase roominess. they both zipped up easily but did not drape well. finally, the fabric was really not welcoming. i prefer terry over fleece, however this w",0
"I splurged on this dress (still a bit pricey, even on sale), but so far it's the best purchase i've made all summer. the terry is a somewhat unusual choice for a dress that otherwise would have been on the fancier side, but it makes it sooooo comfortable--it's even more breathable and lightweight than the super thin cotton sundresses that usually dominate the summer. my only real complaint is that the cut is a bit out of whack. the medium just barely fits my hips, but it's pretty loose on top--y",1
Super flattering! stretch a little with repeated wear but not as much as other pairs. i love these!!!,1
"When ordering this product, i thought it was strange that the mediums were sold out. i went with the small which is generally what i wear. however, these run small and i see why the medium ran out. they are pretty, however, i wish they made them more true to size.",0
"This is a stunning top but it did not work for me because it looked like a maternity top on me.. i think a person needs to be thin with a small bust to carry this off. this would look good with many things, from ripped denim to leather pants, and is not necessarily just for holidays.",1
"Noticed all the 5 star reviews online for the latest pilcro stets- so due to the past 2 years of dissapointment of what was once a great pair of jeans....i was hopeful that retailerpologist listened and went back to the original pilcro stet formula- thick denim, just the right amount of give and a flattering 10 inch rise. walked right in and found them- and i knew right when i touched them- they were still the thin denim that's nowhere near the quality they once were. consumers pay attention and t",0
"These pilcro's jeans are so good!!! love the fit, the color, and the feel. i am a curvy girl and these are great, they hit me just right. now pilcro jeans used to strech out really bad but they seemed to have fixed the problem.i wore these jeans at work for 10 hours and they did stretch some but not a dress size, so i would buy the size you feel the most comfortable. i think these are a no brainer!",1
"When i received the dress, it was true to size on the bust and length. i didn't purchase the petite, but i wish i did since i am 5'2. i tried to wear my wedges, but it's still long. i love the dress and would definitely recommend it.",1
"Let me start by saying that i cannot wear wool. it doesn't matter what type it is or if it is combined with cashmere, it makes me itch so much that i just can't do it and i didn't not find this as itchy as others stated. that being said, you definitely need to size down. i am a standard small and purchased the xs and there is still a load of fabric. i still don't know what to think. i think it is okay but i am not sure it justifies the price point.",1
"I know this is supposed to look oversized, and i own a few oversized ponchos, but this takes oversized to a whole new level.  i ordered it in my usual size and it was just waaaaay too much fabric - i do not think sizing down would have made a difference.  if you are looking for that, it seemed like good qualify.",0
"I ordered this dress in coral. while i like it and the dress is nice, i have many other outfits that i like better so this will be going back to the store. i might have kept it in black or blue.",0
"I generally don't spend this much on jeans but wanted a nice black pair so rolled the dice during the sale. who can wear these? i'm an average size 12 and struggled to get these size 32s over my hips, buttoned and zipped. i looked like a stuffed black sausage. best for thin frames and even then, size up.",1
"This top is way more sparkly and festive in person. i plan to pair it with black or charcoal gray pants for a holiday party, but it would also go great with dark jeans. it is super cute, can't wait to wear it.",1
"The fabric and design are gorgeous so i was hoping the top would work for me. sadly, it looked ridiculous on me. i wouldn't recommend the top for busty girls. it looked like a bell on me. fyi, it doesn't come with a camisole underneath.",0
"Great fit, runs maybe a tad big but overall great fit/quality.",1
It's such a pretty top but i felt that it looked maternity-ish so i returned it.,0
"I hate to be so negative but i can't believe this shirt has so many positive reviews. it is stiff, silver lace and hangs funny if you have a chest. adding a cami undnerneath makes it worse. looks cheap.",0
"Perhaps i should have gotten two sizes smaller, but the knees on these were baggie by lunch.
they are very soft and comfortable, but i wouldn't buy them again.",0
"I purchased the moss green version of this sweater in a m petite. i""m 5'3, 135 lbs with a full bust. i love it! it fits beautifully, and i have received many compliments on it - from both friends and students (and for a high school teacher that's high praise).
when i saw the purple version i debated...two of the same very distinctive style? the answer was a resounding yes! can't wait!
the only minor warning about the sweater - it was very itchy on me the first time i wore it. second time - ok!",1
"I loved them on when i got them, but they literally frayed apart on my body as i wore them, and i had them on no more than 5 times. it was not a fit issue or a seam issue; they literally just frayed apart in two areas.  while flattering and incredibly comfortable, the fabric was not at all durable...they are not your typical  denim,  they almost kind of a knit feel them.",0
"It's rare to find clothing made of quality fabrics, and this is a fine, soft wool blend. the design is feminine without being over-the-top, and the fit is slightly loose, as pictured on the model. i would not recommend wearing it with a belt, as pictured; it makes it look too ""trendy"" and detracts from the shape of the cardigan, which is beautiful on its own just skimming the body. it is a perfect topper and can work for daytime or an evening out. really lovely, and one of the few things i decid",1
Ordered these in a size 32 and they fit perfectly!,1
"I loved these pants. loved them so much that it pained me to return them. but, i used shout stain remover on them once, and it drastically faded them in the spot i used the stain remover, that i had to return them. i'm grateful to retailer for standing by their product and taking the pants back for a full refund. i'm tempted to buy them again if i can't find similar pants elsewhere (and just stay away from the stain remover). but, i'm still undecided.",0
"Amazing style, great fabric and a dress for all occasions. bought the black and love it!",1
Love love love these!! the model does not do them justice since she makes them look like high rise pants. they are very soft with 15% stretch which is why i sized down . i usually wear a 30. you can remove the roll and they fit perfect w a heel . for those curvy women they look great! also have a slouchy appeal too but tailored . i went everywhere looking for chinos and these are the best ones out there!! for reference i am 141 pounds and 5'4 just losing weight from having a baby and absolutely,1
I tried a pair of the hyphen chinos on at retailer and loved them. they are comfortable and a great casual look. i bought two more pairs in different colors on line.,1
"Thank goodness chinos are in this year. i was so excited when i saw these pants, and they did not disappoint when i put them on. the material is so soft with a decent amount of stretch in them, making them incredibly comfy. they fit true to size and are very flattering - not too baggy or frumpy looking. i purchased the rose colored pants, which are basically a light nantucket red color. for reference, i am 5'8"" and ~135/40 lbs and bought a size 28. i'd be very surprised if i don't end up purchas",1
"I ordered this dress after seeing it styled with a beautiful cape.  when it arrived, it was incredibly soft and the color was a pretty, muted pink.  however, once i put it on, it clinged to all the wrong places.  having a larger chest made it show a lot of cleavage and if i can't wear a standard bra with it, it's too complicated.  in a regular tank dress, it would have been a yes. overall a great dress, but probably for another body type.",1
"I tried on the xs in store, but ti was a little big on me (and i usually get petite in dresses, unless they are mini dresses).
so i decide to order the xxs petite. it fits much better. the length is, at the highest point, just above my knees. the chest part fits better on me as xxs p, the plunge is not low, not too high, and is flattering, i can wear a regular bra that can attach as t-back and you won't see anything. 
the model on the picture is what it looks like as a usual size (so xs instea",1
I went with the xs because i didn't want the v neck in the front to be too low. it looks cute paired with a kimono and a necklace.,1
I have these in 3 colors and i always wear a 27 in pilcro. i could probably size down but i like them a little loose. they are great to have in the spring and summer. they are very soft and very comfy.,1
"I ordered a small and i'm usually always a small. i could not zip it up. i'm am returning it for a large, and this is concerning because what if it is big in a weird way because i'm usually a large?",0
"I recently bought this is a medium black and it is a perfect fit.  it's a beautiful top and the peplum portion is perfect and long enough for someone with a lon torso.  for reference, i'm 6ft 175lbs and usually wear a 10/12 or medium/large top.  i went with the medium based on other reviews. i  i was lucky to find this on sale.",1
My husband never has anything negative to say about my clothes until i wore these pants! they are not flattering and kept stretching out until i could pull them off without unzipping them! baggy in the behind and sloppy looking. they are going back asap!,0
"Bought the gold pair and dripped something on them so spot cleaned them with water only. my white washcloth turned bright yellow. the food came out but surrounding area was super faded. so i returned them, took the second pair home, wore them a few times, they stretched out so much, washed them in cold water and they have splotches that are really light. these pants are way too much trouble.",0
These pants are amazing. they are so comfortable and fit true to size. i typically wear a 28 or 29 depending on the pants and the 28s fit me perfectly. i bought the olive green pair and they are everything i have ever wanted in a pair of olive pants. i love that they are tighter in the butt area and loose in the knees and calves so they are not restrictive. i want every color!,1
"I bought a pair of these a month ago and first time i washed them they came out with light spots all down the leg. i figured i did something wrong so i bought another pair in the same color and one in sage. just washed both pairs according to care instructions (no spills, stain remover, or anything but detergent) and both came out with light spots all down the leg. very sad to have wasted all that money.",0
Loved these pants when i tried them on they looked great and felt so comfortable. when i washed according to the directions on the tag the bottom of one leg lost so much color that i can't wear them anymore..so disappointed!,0
"I have three pairs of these, so i must like them. the fabric is soft and comfy right from the start. i think they might run just a bit large or small depending on the color you get. i tried on a pair of pink ones in a 29 in the store. i wanted the moss color, so i had to order that and decided to order my usual size (30). they fit pretty much like the 29's in the pink. but this fabric stretches, so i'm happy with them. they're not too ""boyfriend-y"""", so not sloppy, and you could dress them up wi",1
"Do not waste your money on this.
at first, i bought pilcro hyphen chinos short and i loved it. so i bought this pants in store too. i laundry them yesterday and they both came out colorless. i was so shock. 
fyi, i did not use bleach or chrolox, i mean i don''t use them.i will return them both.
still mad. this is bad quality enough worth it.",0
I wore these pants to work and they fit and looked great! however the first time i put them through the wash they became all discolored and are completely stained and now are unwearable. very disappointing. did not spend that much money to wear a pair of pants once.,0
"Bought a pair of the gray and loved them, but after i washed them i saw the color was distorted as if bleach from a previous wash was still in the machine. 

so i ordered a second pair this one in green - same thing happened after i washed it. looked at instructions (finally!) and it says to wash in cold water - i washed in warm. could that be the problem? 

anyway - now they both look like there's discoloration and not a ""washed look"" that's on purpose. 

i'll still wear them, but an expe",0
"Do not buy these pants!  the first time i washed these pants i ended up with big faded spots, and i followed the washing instructions.  i bought another pair and the same thing happened.  i'm out a bunch of money!",0
"I bought the yellow pair on vacation last week and loved them! i wore them home on the plane and had a pony tail holder in my pocket (basic goody binder), and there is a circle stain where the binder was! so strange! i sprayed them with spray and wash and washed them. the stain is still there and now it is discolored in the area i treated them! they are ruined! i am so disappointed and i only got one wear out of them!",0
"Similar to others here, these pants were ruined after one wash. the first pair i bought simply faded after one wash, which was okay, but the second pair got weird splotches on the backside. i'd rather not call attention to that particular area of my body;) could've been a great addition to my wardrobe if they were better quality.",0
I loved these pants. they fit perfectly. and then i washed them. like the other reviewers the pants came out with spots all over them. the color seems to have faded in splotchy patterns. so sad.  wondering if retailer will provide store credit or something to make it right?,0
"I absolutely fell in love with this dress in the store and immediately scooped it up in black. wore it 3-4 times on hot summer days and it was perfect! very comfortable, easy to throw on and dress up or down. i decided to hand wash instead of dry cleaning (as i usually do) and after hanging dry, it became significantly more translucent than it had been before! i can no longer wear this dress because you can see everything through it. it's as though the fabric completely changed after being wet.",0
"I tried on a l and found it incredibly unflattering on a large chest, as the waist hits a bit high.
the color is vibrant...i wanted to like!",0
"Love these pants. got them in yellow- gold color. pair them with retailer anafa tiered top which also has some yellow tones to it. goes lovely. good quality. important for me - the color is soft, not overly bright yellow, fabric is soft as well. great fit.!",1
"I'm an xl in retailer tops, and purchased this in the size xl. it fits very nicely; not tight. i usually have problems with peplum blouses hitting me oddly since i have a short waist, but this fit beautifully. i like the feel of the high quality fabric. the color green works so well with my red hair. i highly recommend this blouse.",1
"I love the fit of these pants. i bought them in several colors, but unfortunately when i laundered the teal blue pair, the places where the liquid detergent touched them (not bleach, detergent) look like they've touched bleach. i washed them in cold with regular detergent but will be unable to wear them after one wear. i was confused and even checked the detergent to make sure it did not have bleach in it, and it does not. very disappointing and i hope this is not true of the dye in the other co",0
"I love these pilcro pants. i had them in two colors, both beige and khaki. super comfy, and they stretch out a little around the waist with wearing. however, i recently ruined both sets in the wash because i used a stain-stick remover to try to get some grease spots out of them. the stain stick instead lifted the dye off of them! now i have two sets of pants with odd light splotches on them...so sad they aren't more color-fast :(",1
My favorite pants! they do run slightly large so i sized down. i have 3 colors and will continue to add more!,1
I originally got this for myself but it was just a little bit more snug than i liked. i ended up giving it to my daughter. it fits her nicely and she wore it to her holiday party at work and it was a hit!!,1
"These chinos are very well made and has a really good fit. not too tight but a bit more relaxed so depending on the look you are going for, these are great! however, i ordered the bright aqua pair and received a pair that is really more teal. a bit disappointed but i'll live. i'm 5'4"" with a 30 inseam without shoes. these hit about half an inch below my ankle when not rolled up twice.",1
"These pants are so comfortable and fit exactly as i expected. i love the variety of fun colors (i went with the gold). they are cooler than jeans, but just as versatile. i am 5'10"" and the length on me is the same as the model.",1
"These are the most comfortable pants i have tried this season without sacrificing the style. they look best rolled up for that casual, chic look and can be dressed up or down. these do run slightly large. i'm 5""1 and 102- 104 pounds and took the 24 petite size. i bought the white color and will probably try another color or two before my size sells out. love these and really recommend them!",1
"Happy to have tried this one on in store. unlike other peplum, the bottom portion does not pop out. looks good under a cadi as well. find this top very versatile. i got both colors since they are both flattering.",1
I love these pants but be care when you do laundry. the dye transferred to another pair of pilcro chinos that was a little lighter color. very frustrating. label mentioned it but i only noticed after it happened because the colors are both not that dark at all.,0
"These feel well made and so soft, but for me, they were just too low and too baggy...all i did was pull them up and feel uncomfortable. i wanted them to work! maybe in a smaller size they would feel better. i ordered my normal 25, in the light pink. they were very cute, i think i just have a hard time with pants with a rise this low.",1
"This top fit me great across the bust - true to size there, however, it was very loose other than that (outside of the peplum of course). it did not seem flattering for my body shape/did not give me much shape on top. i was wider than i should be/am. this may work on some body types, but did not work for me. it was a nice feeling, comfortable top however.",0
"Retailer, please make these fantastically versatile chinos in tall sizes again! i am 5'11"" and i usually order a size 8. the regular fit hits in the wrong place at the knee and results in the back of the knee fitting and feeling uncomfortable.",0
I wanted to love these pants since i hate super-fitted skinny pants. but they are really oversized. i'm 125lbs and 5 foot 2. so i'm petite but not considered skinny and have well endowed thighs and legs.but the xs was way too big for me.,0
"I love the feel and quality of these pants, however, they ran super big! they would not stay up around my waist, unfortunately.",0
I was thrilled to find a wide-legged pant in a natural fiber and ordered two pairs - l and xl. the l came first and was a tad too close for comfort so i returned it. when the xl arrived it seemed roomy but after my first wear the fold-over jersey knit waistband stretched out and the pants were dragging on the ground. they seem really huge on me and i now have to wear a belt to keep them up. the fabric also seems to be pilling easily- overall not my best retailer purchase (and i am a huge fan,0
"This is such a pretty top and a great multi-season piece. i love the colors and pattern, and the cut is flattering. it's not too low cut in the front which is nice. it is woven on the front/sleeves and knit in the back so i'm a little nervous about how it will wash. i usually wear a m in retailer tops and a l in tiny (they usually are truly tiny) but in this tiny a m was good.",1
"This sweater is much more brilliant in person. the photo online doesn't do it justice. a couple of things, the faux fur collar is removable and it is attached with buttons of the same color as the sweater. the color is also more buttery than it appears. it hits right at the hip, which is so nice for wearing with dresses or skinny jeans and boots for a night out. i am 5'3"", 108 pounds and the xs hit me at hipline and was roomy without being oversized. it's really fun and festive with the collar,",1
"Pants are professional, super comfortable and color matches loads of tops. love them.",1
"I know we've gotten to the point that polyester can be acceptable, but sometimes it's still that horrible texture, unbreathable mess. unfortunately, that's what this top is made out of. so it runs big, its billowy, and cute, but i couldn't get it off quick enough because of the feel of the fabric.",0
"Adorable suit, super cute print and great quality, but unfortunately not as flattering as other reviewers noted. i found that the white pattern accentuated the wrong areas and the ruffle feature was a bit over-the-top. the straps are also very thin and didn't offer too much support.",0
"I have purchased a lot from retailer but lately, some of the items have been disappointing in quality.verses cost, this being one. the picture is nice but the actual blouse is nothing like this. the size was not accurate so buy a size bigger because of the sleeves.",0
"These are beautiful pants - pretty basic, but comfy and you can dress them up. they definitely run large in both length and waist. i'm 5'10"" and having a little bit of a platform or heel is helpful.",1
"This is a great jacket. my only issue is sleeves are way to long and had to have them shortened. this upped my price by 45.00. oh well, its still what i wanted!",1
"The picture makes the pants appear flattering and comfortable. but they are not flattering at all. they seemed much bigger than they should have been and the ""fold over"" portion was not necessary.",0
"This sweater is adorable and comfortable, but the poms are barely secured so they just pop off whenever they rub up against anything. i cannot even imagine trying to wash it. unfortunately, i will reluctantly be returning it because the construction is very poor.",0
"First, i must agree with the other reviewers who said that this jacket is short, because, well, it is. that being said, it is a perfect length for someone who is petite, like me. i am not a fan of lengthy tops or jackets, which tend to make my short body look like a blob. i love the length (or shortness) of this jacket! aside from that it fits true to size, is wonderfully warm and cozy, and makes me feel fabulous when i'm wearing it. it is my new favorite jacket!! :)",1
"I completely agree with the other reviewer. this sweater is so much prettier in person. i've been looking for years for a tasteful fur sweater and i think i finally found it. the size large was true to size for me aside from the very long sleeves, but i also have short arms. the fur isn't overwhelming and i love the pockets. i usually find sweaters with wool itchy but this one is not (it's 26% wool). i do plan to wear a cami or tank underneath.",1
"While i thought it looked really pretty on the hanger, when i tried it on it just felt like a mess. perhaps it suits other personalities and bodies. i hated that the zipper was in the front; i personally find it tacky and gawdy. while the patterns are pretty, the material felt like some weird fabric wallpaper and i didn't see how the price was justified with how the material felt cheap to me.",0
"I recently bought this dress in an retailer store, to attend an art museum event,. the open back created an awkward bra exposure problem, which i solved by buying a gabardia camisole by lacausa (the same brand and print as the dress.) the dress is described as casual, but it can be dressed up with gold shoes or sandals.

the dress is a beautiful cocktail of sexy curvy silhouette with the baroque flavor",1
"I love the dress enough to go on a diet. i sized up but still have reservations about the integrity of the seams if i should sit at any point during its wear. i hate skin tight clothing, and wear a 0 in everything else - the 2 made me feel as if you could see my cervix. i own other byron lars dresses that fit in a 0 - something happened with this dress.",1
The dress is a great buy especially since it was on sale. it fits like his other dresses flattering as i don't have a big bust and have a bit of extra skin from pregnancies but with this dress i feel amazing. get a ton of compliments when i wear it!,1
"I looked like i was going to work on a farm. well made, but seemed fit big. i like and have owned wide leg pants/capris, these were cartoonishly wide.

needless to say, they were returned.",0
I sized down one size and it's still too big with the double v-neck style. this is going back.,0
"This is a richly detailed top that i bought to go with some nice skirts. the length hits right at the waist so it won't overlap a special skirt at the waist and create extra bulk. it is lined with a flesh colored mesh layer in the white color (you can see this layer in the photos but i wasn't sure if it was part of the piece or a camisole the model was wearing). however, it is still somewhat transparent so you would want to wear it with a flesh-colored bra or cami. overall, i am very happy with",1
"This is a gorgeous dress. it comes with a black silky belt, but mine was too large, which is probably why it is not shown on the model photos. i think maybe it only works if you're on the larger size for the dress. it's very easy to get on and off due to the front zipper. i was worried about bra straps showing on the low cut back, but they actually show more at the broad shoulders. i'm not sure if that's more apparent because i went up on the size to have room at the hips. there is a cute kick p",1
"I was disappointed by this dress. i listened to the reviews and ordered one size up, a size 6 instead of my usual 4, and that was the correct size. fit like a glove. unfortunately, the style left much to be desired. this dress is very costume-y. i felt like a wench from the renaissance fair. not a good vibe. it is a beautiful dress, i'm not denying that, but not as a dress you would actually wear to an event. there's just too much going on with the tapestry look and the many types of fabric. i a",0

i historically wear 00p in jcrew and most retailer brands. i purchased a 0p and it fit well with a little room. i really hated that the waistline is almost a drop-waist. the ivory brocade panel comes low on the navel, so it makes you look shorter than you really are.

the most impressive part of this dress is the neckline/shoulder. i have pretty narrow shoulders, so it's a quasi-boatneck and it's quite lovely.",1

"Thin and soft. lays nicely... form-fitting, but with enough fabric to move around and scrunch up without looking tight. the double-v makes it shift downward so the cut in front is pretty low - i have to keep adjusting it so it doesn't show too much. not sure how it'll hold up after a couple washes because the fabric is so lightweight.",1
"I love everything about this dress. the patterns are gorgeous and the mixture of fabrics and textures are so unique that they make such a beautiful statement. i got this in a 0p after reading review, and am usually a 00p-0p. the dress fit a bit baggy on me but if i can find some way to tighten the belt it would definitely still be wearable. i agree with other reviews that the top is larger. my measurements are 31-24-34...and i felt like the bottom fit comfortably with some room but the waist and",1
"I am a shopper....i shop a lot. this is one of my favorite dresses of all time! so unique, and, as others have said, like a piece of art! the fit is tight through the middle but that's what makes it look so perfect. i wore with tall brown suede boots and got compliments from ken and women alike. i love it!",1

"I got this in the green color. it's a beautiful color, soft to the touch. i agree with other reviewers that it seems very delicate. i don't mind dry-cleaning my sweaters, so that's not the issue. the problem is that a. it runs huge - i got the small and it swims on me. i tend to run between small and medium in tops - very unusual to have a small be so big on me and b. the slits go even higher than they look on the model - they come up to the top of my waist. even with high-waisted pants, the sli",0

"This is a flattering, comfortable, soft sweater the instant you put it on. a few instants after that, however, i found mine had relaxed a great deal to become baggy, and pilled even more to become a fuzzy wuzzy monstrosity. i'm not optimistic about its longevity and wouldn't recommend it except for the extravagant single-use buyer.",0
"Definitely a curve hugger. i bought the summer version of this dress (sleeveless white with black stripes) earlier this year and it was my go to dress all season long. was very excited to see a fall/winter version to pair with tights and boots. bought a medium again and it fits great. this is a very flattering dress, and the material is lightweight yet substantial and forgiving of flaws.",1
"I bought this mostly to wear around the house, so i'll keep it because i got it on a pretty good sale.

that said, this runs really large. the sleeves are really loose, and it doesn't really hang well over my hips, which is a shame. it's very soft and cozy, which is nice, but i don't think i'll leave the house in it often. it also arrived with a hole in the ribbing on the bottom of the front panel. i was able to tie a knot through one of the loops that i think will prevent further unraveling, bu",0
"I liked this sweater's design, i like tunics. the sweater is a light weight knit.the sleeves are long. i got the green, which is lighter than the picture. the slit on sides go up about 18 inches from the bottom. the sweater is comfy, but a shirt is needed under or your ""love handles ""will be showing, if you have them. i also ordered the cream color, but it was more brownish than white, so i returned it.",1
"I was so excited to see this on sale, with an extra 25% off! no brainer. i bought the cream color which is the most beautiful sand color. just as shown. it is super soft and thin. a good quality thin knit. it's just too long for me. it just doesn't quite look right on me. i still have to give it a high rating because it is truly exactly as pictured. i'm 5'9 and it hits just above my knees and the slit runs up to my belt. if i could knock 3inches off this i'd have it in every color.",1
"This sweater/tunic is lovely - soft, just enough structure in the top to not look like a sack, pretty color. i ordered the ""raspberry"" which is definitely more of a ""burnt orange-red"" to my eye. i understand what another reviewer was referring to regarding quality. the fabric just doesn't feel very substantial or strong. i have a feeling this might not last too long and it's a shame at this price point. i'd love to order another color but will definitely wait for sale. it's office appropriate an",1
"I love this sweater - i've gotten compliments on it every time i've worn it! i have the moth color and it is oh so cozy, yet not too big or too heavy. i pair it with black leggings, black booties and a crimson-colored scarf. it's nice as it can be great for day-to-evening. getting the other two colors asap! the medium fits me perfectly.",1
"The black and white photo of this sweater makes it look absolutely beautiful. the color photography looked to be a beautiful rich burnt red color. it simply did not match. it was more of an almost faded version of the rich color. the fit was ""ok"". just didn't love it.",0
"This sweater/tunic is very poor quality - the seams looked like they were about to come apart as soon as i got it. and, without a chunky statement necklace, it looks like your grandmothers apron. there just isn't any style to it - has to go back.",0
I love this sweater. looks great with leggings or high waisted jeans. like most maeve clothing it runs a little large so i would size down. i get several compliments every time i wear this one. super comfortable too!,1
"The sweater is very comfy and looked good the first time i tried it on, however the material is thin and slightly see through.
also, after one wear it completely stretched out and made the long sleeves awkward to wear without washing in between each wear. after the third time i wore it, i discovered a large hole in the armpit, most likely due to the excessive washing. i would not recommend this sweater.",0
"I agree with the first reviewer exactly. beautiful fabric and ""idea"" of dress (looks stunning on model), but huge and shapeless in person like a tent. not at all what i expected when ordering a 2 petite. sadly, has to be returned.",0
"This sweater is really cute, great fit and unique style. unfortunately the ivory color was more yellow than i like. not the right shade for my skin tone.",0
This sweater in the yellow caught my eye several times and i finally tried it on! so cute and perfect for transitional weather. threw it over the striped top that was hanging in the changing room. ended up with both!,1
"The xs was too large on me and i'm not a tiny person. while the dress was beautiful on the model, in person it had way too much fabric and fit rather tent-like. the fabric is gorgeous and the dress would have worked if it were more of a fitted style and had half the amount of fabric on the bottom. not flattering at all.",0
"I ordered this sweater in green, and it was a lovely soft color. the style of the sweater was nice -- really deep side splits made it feel trendy. the sweater is a great length, nice fabric and the side splits are appealing. however, it was just so, so big that i couldn't pull it off -- i just swam in it. i am 5'8"" and 118 lbs, fairly wiry?.even the xs didn't work for me. perhaps it would look more suitable on a curvier woman. i even considered having it tailored, since i've had a hard time find",0
"I was really disappointed in the shirt. the blue embroidery is a lot darker than what is shown in the photo, and barely stands out against the black. the photo does not accurately depict this shirt. i will be returning.",0
"I thought i was getting this nice light weight white sweater but not the case.
it is a pretty heavy, nice thick cotton and beautiful made. it does run large. i got the small and love the oversize feel even on my 5'9"" frame. 
but - it is not white, it is beige, and it is not light weight. i have enough beige sweaters in this look so this one is going back, even though it was a great buy on sale.",1
"I wish i could wear this sweater every day! it is extremely soft. runs large. 5'9"", 130lbs, bought a large and it was way too big, but i successfully shrunk it in the dryer. sleeves are too bulky. it's not perfection, especially the sleeves. the photo shows the models with the sleeves pushed up. there is no way you could do that. they are almost like bell sleeves, and the material stretches like crazy. wish i had ordered down, but still love it.",1
I'm so sad this doesn't come in a petite length because the dress is extremely long! the fabric and design is beautiful although i do wish the fabric was a bit more flowly.,1
"I really wanted to recommend this sweater but honestly can't now. i was attracted to the softness, simplicity and sale price but its longevity ruined it. wrinkles, pills and loses shape quickly. if you still want to get it, consider your shoulders and how knits like this fit on you. this sweater runs tts to large depending on your shoulders and bust size. the styling is excellent--very versatile. but the yarn is too delicate and fussy.",0
"A lovely sweatshirt with mesh front and back cover with soucotache (sp?) handwork, with a touch of sequins for some pop! the knit sleeves are thin, but the top has some weight due to the detailing on the front and back.

the fit is tts and as shown on the model. it lays comfortable but it's not really baggy.

really lovely. glad i bought one before it was sold out.",1
"I purchased the raspberry color and it is beautiful. even though the sweater is very long and covers your bottom, it is surprisingly flattering. great with the booties or boots and skinny jeans. i am 34, 30, 37 and purchased a size small which, fits perfectly.",1
"This has such a beautiful shape, goes with so many things and has gotten a lot of compliments already. my favorite new piece.",1
"This dress is so well made, but it's a lot of dress. i think i would have liked it if it were shorter. it felt a little too 50s housewife to me, and i was hoping for a flowing material. it wasn't worth the price to me so i sent it back.",0
"After reading all the reviews and sizing down one size. i got my top size m, i usually wear m/l depending on the style. i'm 6 ft tall, 160 lb, i like my clothing loose but not as loose as this top. i should have gone to xxxxxs if such exists. no wonder there is such a low leap in price. it is a good quality though, and very nice pale peach color. no would not recommend, unless you wear 3xxxl",0
"I am not a fan of unlined bras, but this one was so pretty i had to try it. the lace doesn't look cheap, but overall i wouldn't have wanted to pay full price. it fits well and the support offers a nice shape (no cone!). i might go back for the other color.",1
"Not that i don't recommend, only don't recommend if you have muscular thighs. so i tried on the small in plaid pattern (or checkered?) and not flattering on me at all. snug on the though and loose by the knee and below. also that pattern made my legs look weird, no kidding, kind of crooked... they are super comfortable and the small fit, so perhaps they run small?

i would get petite if you are usually a petite, the regular size bunched on the bottom, too long.

i am usually a 0p or 00p, or",0
"Being that i am short, 5'2"", this skirt flares out way too much resembling a 50's style poodle skirt. the model in photo has her arm strategically placed thus pushing back excess fabric toward the back making it look more streamline. this skirt is not for the under 5'5"". long leggy types could easily ""rock"" this.",0
"I thought this top had shimmery dots, that is what it looks like in the picture. but when it arrived, it looks much plainer in-person and i could not believe it was this top. the dots are polka dots. the embroidery at the v-neck doesn't stand out much in the photo but it does in-person. the top runs true to size but the fit didn't feel as perfect for me. i am sending it back. i needed a more shimmery top.",0
"I ordered the black and red check leggings thanks to the suggestion of the retailer stylists online. there is no way in a million years that i would have picked these out due to my body shape. i'm petite size 6 and 120 pounds and 5 feet tall. i ordered a petite small. i do not have skinny legs and ordered these anyway. they are so flattering that i'm thinking of ordering the grey pair. the red pair are kind of darker. the picture makes the red look so much bright than they really are. trust me, yo",1
"Oh how i love moth sweaters but wow was this one a disappointment. the color is wonderful, the shape is unique and the stitch work is lovely but that's where the compliments end. it's an itchy, cheap feeling acrylic that is too short for my torso. i am truly disappointed that at this price point it was such a cheap feeling piece. so bummed. so so bummed.",0
"This looked beautiful online, but the skirt isn't 100% silk - the strips of fabric have different fiber content levels, with most of them containing some level of polyester. parts of the skirt felt like plastic to touch, and one strip has a very prominent gold sheen that looks cheap. overall very disappointing - this is not at all the beautiful silk skirt that it appears to be online.

a definite return. i wouldn't even recommend this at first or second cut.",0
"I got the size wrong, and the right size was ot available - so sad! i really loved this.",1
"If you are over 25, this top probably is not for you. it is absolutely see-thru. great style and beautiful light fabric, but you can see right thru it.",0
"Love it, super cute, super comfortable. watch those bra straps!",1
The fabric of this looks and feels so cheap it's hard to believe this is anna sui. i would say this is unwearable. there is zero stretch and it is made of itchy textured poly fabric that looks like novelty fabric at best. going back asap.,0
"I am petite and so ordered this top in a petite size and found that it ran large. i am also pretty busty to boot, but found there was more than enough room. the length was still a bit long for me, however it does hit on my where it does on the model. the top is wonderful quality, thick and not see through at all. i am almost tempted to get a regular size and try to wear it as a dress.",1
"This was a miss for me. the armholes are too low, it's lined and heavy. way too long. just didn't wow me. the lace is sturdy and beautiful, though.",1
"This dress is nice, but it won't do for my purpose. i considered it for a mother of the groom dress, but it's not long enough for me. the dress is pretty, but very sheer and very low cut so it would require opaque undergarments. it's not possible to tell from the pictures how sheer this dress is.",0
"I'm 5'9 and 150 pounds and got a medium. the cut is very flattering on me and i have received many compliments when i wear it. it is lined, so no need to wear a cami underneath.",1
This top is so flowy and has a great fit! i can see wearing it lots of different ways. it could definitely be dressed up or dressed down.,1
"But-the problem is i cannot get the color to stay below the shoulders. the large appeal of this top is the over the shoulder look-but in just trying it on it would pop off the shoulders and make a cowl neck kind of top that didn't lay right. if it would have stayed it would have been a real win for me. i like the quality of the fabric and the longs sleeves, but i can't get the desired look to work out so this is going back.",0
"Not for petite women, you need to have a long figure for this tunic to drape like it does on the model. if it ever goes on sale i will purchase it but not worth the full price for me at the moment.",1
The material on this dress is gorgeous. so soft! the fit is flattering and casual and looks great with booties or high boots!,1
"The material and color of the dress were great, but the fit was rather blah. i don't think it was right for my shape. i am disappointed though, i liked design of it.",0
"I was definitely wearing retailer colored glasses (my term for when something looks great on you in the dressing room but leaves you wondering what-was-i-thinking when you try it on later) when i bought this. once i tried this on at home, i basically felt like i was swallowed up by this thing -- there's so much fabric layered in front and around your shoulders that you can actually feel the weight hanging down around your neck, and it naturally sticks out rather far in the back. i wanted to love t",0
"I love the elbow patches on this shirt. i ordered the wine color, and it's dark enough to almost be a neutral. i've worn it with many things already. my only complaint is that the sleeves are super long. typically, long sleeved shirts are too short for me, so i'm guessing this one would be ridiculously long on someone with short arms.",1
"This is absolutely gorgeous cardigan! the pictures don't do it justice! it's comfortable and soft and very trendy at the same time! i bought it in teal and in medium, i am 5'3"" and usually wear 10-12! even though i think it runs tts, but for more fitted look, medium fits better ! i am blond and this color looks great! i also loved it when unzipped the upper part, it looked even better! it is perfect with leggings in grey, blue, green and black, also beautiful with aqua flora leggings and with re",1
"I was a bit worried when i took it out of the packaging but once i tried it on, all was well. it is a cute and comfortable outfit with enough detail to be stylish. i love rompers and this one is a great addition to the wardrobe.",1
I have this dress in red and black and i'm contemplating getting the green one. it's amazingly soft and falls beautifully. really flattering and i just had a baby 6 weeks ago! it's true to size. i'm 5'6 and 138lbs and got a small. it should still fit fine once the rest of the baby weight is gone.,1
I really like the design and colors and the material is so soft and comfy. the top is a little on the short side so wearing a tank underneath is an option if you don't want your stomach to show when you raise your arms.,1
Not sure why this dress was once backordered? if you have a big chested basically falls from your chest straight down and gives you know figure. disappointing. i will be returning it. not meant for big chested fit woman.,0
"Great ""sweater/jacket for spring and fall! i am a pilates tea her and great for before and after workouts! great price and a little thicker material like a sweatshirt to keep you nice and warm. tried it in-store and bought on online ! love",1
"I wish i could wax poetic about this gorgeous cardigan. i would have happily bought it in both colors except for the deal-breaking design flaw - the extremely tight sleeves. even if you have stick-thin arms, i don't know how you would ever be able to wear anything other than a tank top under it. sadly for me, this was a no go :(",0
"I really like this jumpsuit, it is long waisted on me so i hope that washing it helped. love the material and washed up nicely. should be really comfortable.",1
A slip underneath makes this dress substantial. it's a good 'weather' transition dress-fall/spring. the lace is very pretty and it's an overall great dress that will take you anywhere. i plan to wear burgundy tights and brown boots with ti next weekend.,1
This is very large.  i normally am a s/m and i took this in an x.  it is a beautiful dress in color and fit but picks up any stain and i have had to have it dry cleaned after every use.,0
"First i think this dress runs a bit large - i am 5'5"" and about 140, athletic build. i tried on a l, m, s and ended up keeping the small. it is also a bit longer than i'd like, hits me in the mid-knee in the back hem, and barely above my knee on the front hem, not mid-thigh like on the tall model. i probably would have preferred a petite size but they were sold out. anyhow i decided to keep this dress because it is super comfortable but still stylish enough to wear to work. the slightly fitted a",1
"This is one of the best things i've ever purchased at retailer. it's comfortable, stylish, and flattering. i ordered it in black, and i'm now ordering the green as well. i usually wear small in the dolan line, and this is no exception. i am 5'2"", 135 lbs, athletic build, and the regular small fits perfectly.",1
This sweater would have been a better fit for me if the sleeves were slightly larger and had a button/snap on the front. the material is soft and comfortable. black pairs well with jeans.,1
"The material is soft (maybe not the best quality) and the cut is easy to wear. i have both colors and love them...they wash nicely and i like the ""baseball"" cut at the bottom. i especially like the print at the neck line...very cute and feminine.",1
"I snapped this up under the 20% off top sale and free shipping because it looks so pretty. i ordered a large because i usually take a large or xl in tops. it is huge! i could have taken a medium if not for the lining -- which is tiny! the lining does not cover the chest and bra area and hits the belly button area while the orange part falls down to the hips. and it looks like a block and makes me look wide. who needs that? like i said, a medium would fit better and would not be so wide, but i fe",0
"I purchased this top in the white and love the contrast between the stripes and floral pattern around the neckline. it fit perfectly, however i'm concerned that it might shrink because then it would be too short. i am 5'3"" tall, 120 lbs. and small busted. it draped really nicely. small would give me a little more length but may be too loose.",1
I love this dress and was hoping to get it in more colors. i was bummed when my size xs regular was out of stock. i would've even ordered it in a s regular but that was out of stock too. please get more in...love the deep red color!,1
"Beautiful color and softness, very warm, but the front is way too much material. it just wasn't flattering the way i wanted it to be. perhaps on a taller woman this would work.",0
"I am a petite size 10 and 5&#39;1&quot;     i love the fabric and style of the dress, but found it to be too much dress for me.  the skirt is very full and with the top i feel it would look better on a thin, taller person.",0
"I have a long torso and wider back/thick middle in proportion to my narrow tights.  i was worried after reading other reviewers comments.  for reference i'm a 2 in pants, 26-27 in jeans, xs in retailer tops but for floreat and maeve i'm always a 6.  i ordered a size 6 and it was perfect.  with my long torso i expected this dress to fit weird but it was perfection.  in love.  i wore it with faryl robin lace up sandals",1
"I saw these paired with the denim swing tank in the store and was inspired by the nautical look! the fit was a little snug. i am between a 4-6 in pants and definitely had to go with the 6, and even that was a little tight. for reference i am 5'6 and 125 lbs, curvy on bottom. the sales lady said they will stretch and there is some give to them, but i don't anticipate a lot of stretch. they are slim fitting all the way down and are flattering to the rear. i think they look better in person than on",1
"I love this pant. it is so soft and has some stretch in it. the first pair i tried in a size 10 and the sales associate suggested trying a size 12 as ithis pant should not fit tight as it is a trouser. tie 12 is perfect. it reminds me of a ""retro"" pant,which i love.",1
I bought this dress to wear to a fall wedding. it is absolutely gorgeous! the actual fabric is much more detailed in person. sizing is accurate. the dress is knee length. there is a little tulle underneath to give it the a-line shape.,1
"I am a pretty consistent size 2 or 26. ordered these in my usual 26 and, yikes, right out of the package knew they''d be way to small. they have a lot of stretch in them so i was able to get them buttoned but they were wayyyy too small and looked awful. i returned them for a 27 which i am still waiting for. i'll update this review when they arrive. other than the size issue, they were just as pictured/expected.",1
"Cute jeans, but they hit me a little higher on the calf than i would like so sadly i will be returning them.",1
"Based on other reviews, i ordered these trousers in my regular size 8 (dark grey) and up one size10 (black motif). the size 8 fit perfectly; and the size 10 are too big (returning). i am not sure what the other reviewers experienced, but size 8 in this brand fits, regardless of style. i also prefer the solid grey, but that is just a personal choice. i felt the black motif trousers looked like pajama bottoms.",0
"These ran very small compared to other charlie pants i've bought in the past. even sizing up, the stripes were not flattering. the lady in the next dressing room over tried them on, too, and had the same feeling i did. the less curvy you are, the better stripes look. they more curvy you are, the less flattering stripes on pants look. the way the stripes come together at the seams just isn't flattering.",0
I was sooo excited to buy this top and it was such a bummer. this top hangs so poorly and is so droopy under the arms. it's clearly poorly made and the sizing was way off on me. i ordered my usual medium and it was so large and wide that i had to return it. it weirdly fit perfectly in the shoulders and arm length as mediums do for me but was so wide and unflattering for my figure (5'8 and athletic). i really wanted to like this top and considered ordering a small to see if it would fit better bu,0
"I love ag for their soft, stretchy denim and flattering fit. bought these today and couldn't be happier! i usually order stevies in the petite ankle size, but the ""regular"" capri length fit perfectly skimmed my ankle.",1
"I was hesitant to order this top since i didnt know how well the design would be made on the front. i liked it, but sometimes items are different when you get them. this shirt was as pictured! the design is well made and there are no stray strings and i think it's probably one of the nicer designs available. the top iis a dressier fabric but can be worn with jeans as well as dress pants. also, some shirts with this cut are skimpy in the front and leave more skin exposed than what you see here. t",1
I love this dress!,1
"When i tried this top on, i started laughing. the two rows of ruffles are made of a starchy thick cotton, which, instead of falling by the hips, juts out like wings. it's also huge. cute idea, wrong material and placement.",0
"This looks like the perfect easy sweater with the white shirt appeal to it, but sadly the fit of this number is really off. it looks more like a tent. it must have been clipped in the back or something. i cannot see any scenario in which this would look good...",0
"I saw this dress on the girl working the fitting room at my local store. she had it knotted in the front with some cute cognac sandals. i immediately fell in love! i tried on the xs, my normal size, and it fit like a dream. so comfortable!! it was a little pricey so i held off but couldn't stop thinking about it. i went back the next day, caved & purchased. it's one of my favorite dresses for summer now. i love this brand so i wasn't surprised!",1
This looks so cute...but don't be fooled. it is so poofy. it does not look in real life like it does on the model. it poofs way out on the sides and looks ridiculous. i was so disappointed.,0
"This top does sit weird, feels like a circus outfit... but at the same time its unique in its own way. i ordered a large and it was true to size in shoulders and chest area but larger and wider waist down, probably because of the way this top is styled. i'm 6ft tall 160 lbs i have curvy body and small chest 34a and i felt that top was a little too cropped for my long torso but i kind of liked it anyway. material is nice and soft for both grey wool and white cotton.",1
"I'm 5'10"", approximate size of model pictured, however this dress is at least 3 in shorter on me. the fabric is a bit thin and the v-neck is quite deep...
but i happily wore it on the beaches of puerto rico, added a jean jacket and epice scarf and wore it in paris. last week i wore it  belted ( as i saw a sales associate in antro do) with an open weave sweater and flip-flops on a warm boston day. don't count it out yet, it really is a chameleon piece that you can wear so many ways.",1
"I wanted to love this dress, as the length, cut, and color are exactly what i've been looking for. but i was terribly disappointed in how thin and see through the material is.",0
"I love, love, love this skirt. very flattering. i am 5'7"",125# with a 27"" waist, and ordered a size 4 based on previous reviews. yes, it is snug through the hips. i think it will stretch a bit with wear; however, i imagine curvy ladies may want to size up (sadly, i was not blessed with much in the way of curves). the material is thick. the skirt is lined. the print is beautiful. this is one skirt i was happy to pay full price for rather than risk missing it.",1
"I have worn this dress with a jean jacket, birkenstocks or a dressier wedged sandal. it washes beautifully and is super soft. would buy in different colors if there were more options. looks better in person.",1
Fits and lots nothing like picture. very wide like a tent dress!,0
"Loved the color! loved the scallops! wish i loved it on me. the poplin fabric is very structured, which doesn't lend to a nice drape. the bottom hem was a little small for my curvy hips, so the top rode up a bit on me. looks lovely on a straighter figure, but wasn't amazing for me.",0
"Love this top! got it in white for a recent trip to paris - felt chic and cool during a bit of a spring heat wave in the city of lights. it runs somewhat small - i'm 5'7, 128 lbs, broad shoulders, and got the 6. my usual 4 fit but was a little snug. i would recommend going up in size in this style. the 6 looked better because it is supposed to be a boxy, swingy top.",1
"Loved the color. the fabric is soft and comfy. ordered in my normal size large but it clung in the stomach, hip area where i carry my weight. would have liked the slits to be higher. overall just not a good look for me so returned.",1
Just didn't look as cute on me as the pics online. the color blocking was kind of odd actually. returning.,0
"I created a summer capsule wardrobe for travel and this t-shirt dress fits in with my collection perfectly. it is well made, super soft and comfortable, launders well, and does not require ironing. it is substantial enough to provide coverage across the posterior and the cap sleeves and length are fabulous for visiting sacred places and dining out or as a beach cover-up. i love that you can simply throws this on and go or dress it up with a belt, add a scarf or kimono, or a jacket and voila.",1
"I debated getting this top, and i am glad that i did! i got the pink, and it is a fun, vibrant color. someone suggested that if you are in between sizes, go up. i agree with that feeling; however, it is pretty true to size. it is preppy, cute, and classic.",1
"As the title suggests, i am very skeptical and scared of pencil skirts. i'm slim (sz 0) and on the shorter side (5'4''), but i have ""dramatic hips"", so i've always had a testy relationship with any clothing that exaggerates them. i'm obsessed with uniquely designed skirts thought, so i had to try this and i am so pleased i did!

the fit is great and not too tight, allows for a little room for ladies with hips. i only wish the zipper went down a little further so shimmying out of it were a little",1
"I purchased this in white my normal size being a 2, a size 4 fit better on me. i love the crisp white top with jeans and sandals, so much that i just ordered the same top in the raspberry color. 

would definitely recommend.",1
"Nice quality and feel to the fabric but they are super lightweight and do not come down to the ankle. they fall at a strange place on the calf - a better cropped summer pant, perhaps.",0
"I liked the idea of this t-shirt dress for a great basic wardrobe staple; however, i feel that it was overpriced for the quality. it's a nice piece but i would wait for it to go on sale.",0
"Hesitated to try it on because it was ""t-shirt dress"" and my experience has been that fabric is unforgiving for dimples or imperfections   i was wrong with this one. it's great!  color is nice. fabric looks textured bc of the dye. the neck line is perfect (i like a lower v) and the length is great bc of the side slits. i tried it on with the front panel knotted at the bottom (how it was on the hanger) and i love it.  had to get. can dress up or down, but i'd say this has mostly a casual feel.",1
"I bought this well made cute top today and love it. it can be day time casual or dressy for dinner. you will want to probably wear a cami underneath since its see through. its perfect for summer! im a 36d, 5'7"" 135 pounds, and usually wear a medium, but the small fit perfectly with room to spare. cuter in person.",1
I ordered an xxs online and it's still massive. the only thing i can use it for is a beach coverup. the embroidery is pretty but i will be returning.,0

"The blue is a beautiful color, rather unique and it is really soft being cashmere. although, for the price i do feel it should of been a bit more ""special"". i also feel it's loose lower half feels a bit maternity. all that being said i do like the overall sweater and am keeping it as the color and feel win.",1
Beautiful top and beautiful bright color. this does run 2 sizes small in arms and chest unless you are very narrow in stature and flat chested . i am usually a size 6 and a 36c and broad shoulders and size 10 just its in underarm area. i have short torso so love the length but those with very long torso may find this blouse too short. if you get the right size this topics really adorable. my husband also gave it a big thumbs up.,1
"Loved this shirt when i saw the picture. unfortunately fit was not what it needed to be to keep it. you can't really see in the photo but if you have any chest at all (i am only 34b...so would say of average size bust) this shirt will not fit well. there is a seam in the bust area that cuts across the bust which is not flattering/doesn't fit well . the sleeves were also a bit more tight than i'd have thought from the photo.

really wanted to love this - but unless you have a smaller chest it lik",0
"I love this top! the neckline is so unusual and so flattering. i am normally either a small or xs, but this fit great in the xs. i was also able to wear a regular bra which is always nice since i am large chested. great top...highly recommend.",1
"The styling of this top is so cute but the fabric is thin, kind of scratchy & has
almost no give to it.  it is very uncomfortable on & is very restricting as far as
movement is concerned.   cannot recommend - back it goes!",0
"I fell in love with the shirt when i saw it online; but, i was incredibly disappointed with it when it was delivered.  on the positive side, the macrame is stunning.  once again, there was way too much fabric which makes me look pregnant.  most importantly, the color is not peach!  it's almost a burnt indian red or brick red/orange.  it was a disgusting color.",0
"This sweater is substantial, well-made, fabric is thick and comfortable. the length is on the shorter side, not cropped but shorter, perhaps if they had petite, ti would be cropped. the sleeves are perfect length too on me, it looks shorter on the model, they hit at mys wrists (i do usually need petite length). it seems a simple top, but it is quite beautiful in person. i strongly recommend it, even for the price...

xs and i am 115 lbs, 30dd chest, 26.5 in waist",1
Great top but it runs smaller than other tops in this brand. the chest and arm area is small. otherwise this top is great. just plan to size up one or two sizes. length was nice. hit right at the waist.,1
"I love the teal color of this t-shirt and the macrame design at the top is beautiful, however, the top is way too large.  i usually wear a size xs or s in retailer tops, so i ordered the size s, there is so much fabric below the chest it fits like a maternity top.  i know if i order an xs, i will have the same problem.  below the bust, the top is not flattering and it&amp;#39;s a shame.",0
"I initially liked the feel and quality of the top but once it was on it was much shorter and looser than the picture of the model. it flowed out from my chest with one central pleat in the front and my husband said it made me look pregnant. then came the tedious task of taking it off with such a snug fit in the shoulders. i'm regularly a size 2/xs, 32d and 120 lbs and both size 2 and 4 did not work for me.",0
I looked at this dress for a long time before i purchased it because of the money. i wear a size 2p. was entirely disappointed in the style and construction of this dress. for one thing the lining is bulky and you could never wear it in warmer weather without burning up. the dress as pictured looks very feminine and light weight silk but there is just too much material going on--- thick and heavy. the overall fit was too big and very unflattering.,0
"When i saw these lounge pants, i felt as though they were designed specifically for me. i love the cute bird design. i love the green/blue color of the fabric. the material is soft and inviting. give them a try. you won't regret it!",1
Received this in the mail today and was disappointed. i typically wear a 6/8 but bought this in the 8 as i had purchased another similar top from the same company in an 8. this does not fit the same at all. the top pulled in my shoulder and chest area while had ample room in the body. needless to say i will be returning this item,0
"Sleeves were tight, was difficult to put on ?. for the price, you want to love the shirt. sending it back.",0
"I tried this top in xs in store.  i loved the macrame  detail and quality of fabric.  it billowed out too much below the chest and looked tent like.  my daughter laughed when she saw me in it- so did i!  i didn't buy it.  i'm 5'2"", 115#.",0
"I love the material of this shirt and i love the design; however, there is just too much fabric. it felt very boxy and gave me no shape at all. for someone who is petite this just wasn't flattering. i love the design idea though!",0
"Lovey top in the photos. however, its fairly large and the chest area can make you look even larger. i'm 5'3, 118lbs, 36c. generally wear xs or 2s in retailer tops. ordered the xs but it was just too large and unflattering. the lace work is so pretty. it has potential but the design doesn't work well for some.",0
"Sunday in brooklyn has been killing it lately with their tops! i could not decide between this and another of theirs, but i am glad i chose this one. first, the design is great. very cunning style: the sleeve length matches the length of the top tier, which gives this top a very finished look. the color is a beautiful jewel-like raspberry red with a bluish undertone. and, the fabric is a nice washable poly. i wore my usual size xs at retailer.",1
"This is a very cute top. i am 5'4'', 170lbs, 34dd, and a large fit great. it fit perfectly in the chest, but the top is meant to be baggy at the bottom and long (it covers my bum). looks very cute with skinny jeans. love it!",1
"This is a great, effortless top. you can dress it up or down and fits true to size. it's forgiving and the straps draw your eye to the most flattering part of the body. the fabric is stretchy and and comfortable.",1
"This top is tight across the bust (i am a 32dd cup) and more trapeze-shaped than the picture shows. if you are smaller busted, it may not flare out as much.
also- the sz 10 is what was tight - and i usually wear a sz. 4 or 6, or small-size top/blouse.
in the end, this wasn't very flattering as it looked more like a maternity top.",0
"I was obsessed with this top. i ordered my normal 4 and was bummed about the fit in the shoulders. the slight puff was too far in, it didn't hit on my shoulder. so i returned it to a store and ordered a 6. it came quickly but it was still too narrow in the shoulders. i took it to the store and held it against the 4 and the seam was the same length between the neck and shoulder as the 4. both returned. i had no hope for an 8.",0
"This is the first hd in paris top i haven't loved. high hopes for this top since i love the brand and the color. this was an online only item so i guessed at the size, typically order a 4 petite. ordered the 4 regular since the length was already quite short in the regular length. it was oddly constructed, small in the arms but boxy and oddly bell shaped bottom. the lining was tough to keep straightened while trying to put it
on. too bad, but it went back",0
"This dress is as stunning in person as it is in these pictures! i'm petite, and so it's longer on me than it is on the model. i got a 4p and the waist was perfect! i thought it might look matronly as it was longer, but it looks classic. i feel like i could dress it down just a bit with flats and a cardi, or wear it to an event with heals and a wrap. it's so comfortable and forgiving in the waist and belly area, which is icing on the cake! i had absolutely no reason to buy it, but once i tried it",1
The fabric is great. the design is fun. i thought the dress would be perfect for work and also wear for a fun night out. the fit was perfect up top but the bottom part was to full and a lot longer then i expected. so i had to return it.,1
"This reminded me of big bird in person and just adds volume to your body. i'm thin and usually wear a size 0, so i'm not sure who this may look good on.",0
I have no idea why this has bad reviews! how is there any left?! this is a beautiful piece that i had to have in both the navy and green. i love that it comes with a cami. it&#39;s very flattering and not too wide or boxy. the lace detail is amazing! i bought my usual size and it fits perfect. love this top!!,1
"This top in the remaining blue - green is not the top pictured.  it's like the photos posted in a recent review by inwonderland.  the color is deep and beautiful.  the neck is high, the lace is floral, there's a seam under the bust with a center pleat falling from it.  there's no reason for hesitancy at the sale price.",1
"Though the quality is good and the fabric is both sturdy and soft, the cut of this top made this a no-go for me. it's a bit short in front and also boxy, which is emphasized by the dolman sleeves. i ordered the coral color and it was much brighter - almost neon-y - as opposed to the soft salmon color my screen shows. i regretfully returned it.",0
"This dress fits really cute. i actually think it's cuter in person than on the site. really flattering. the skirt hits a few inches longer on me than it does on the model, so it's appropriate for work and networking functions. i'm 5'3, 110lbs. i got the 0 and it's great!",1
"This is the kind of weather i want to wrap myself up with a cozy and soft blanket. but i can't really walking around with a giant bulky blanket. this cardigan is as good as i can get. it's so soft, comfy and well made. nowadays most of the knitwear are made of dominantly polyester. this one is mostly natural material with has a much better feel than the man made kind.
i like how this garment is not too bulky and not too tight. warm enough for the breeze but not too thick. love it!",1
"This dress has a beautiful shape. it was a onesie in a store (only one they had) and i'm glad i tried it on. usually i'm a 6 or 4. this is an 8, and it's a perfect fit. definitely size up at least one dress size. the knit shoulders are beautiful and the belt is slimming. i love the writing on it. it's a classic dress and it makes me feel beautiful and unique.",1
"The fabric and color are absolutely beautiful. the shape of the dress is strange - fitted and tight through the waist, and enormous everywhere else. it was not flattering.",0
This is a great up-to-date twist on a must-have staple - a black (or grey) cardigan. easy flowing and flattering style and warm enough for fall weather.,1
"I absolutely loved this dress, the style is flattering and the mix of fabrics and lace make it truly feminine and unique. the only problem is the bust runs really small. i normally wear a 4-6 in retailer but i ordered a 6 and and 8 and both were way to tight in the bust. very disappointed because i really wanted to keep this dress.",1
"I am very glad i purchased these shorts on sale. bought the coral color in a large. 5'7"" 140lbs with a generous underside and long legs, i usually wear a m or a l in yoga pants. the l here fits really nicely--not too tight and enough length in the inseam so that i don't feel silly practicing outdoors in the park. the rise is also perfect.",1
"This has such awful proportions. i'm 5'0 and 100 lbs, ordered xxs petite (in the neutral color). the seam at the bust literally hits in the middle of my bust!! it looks very unflattering, and it's very pronounced. i'm only 5'0 and already the seam hits at such a high point on me. below the seam the sweater is all scrunched up where it's sewed, and it balloons outward and is very square from there down. very shapeless sweater and not flattering at all unless you have your arms by your sides to hi",0
"I purchased this dress to wear to a beach wedding. i loved the color, the fit and the style. i even got a lot of compliments on it. the problem was that the wedding was on the beach, in florida 85 degree weather and when you are sweating the fabric changes colors and takes a really really long time to return to normal! unfortunately i had to return it. would be great to wear indoors, just watch getting water or anything else on it!",0
"Oh just wow. this jacket is simply wonderful. ordered my regular size large and it's a bit oversized due to the swing cut and absolutely adorable on. love everything about it except the length which is very cropped. it's lightweight yet warm and very cuddly. the snap closure is wonderful. then there's the leather trim which just takes it up a notch. plenty of room for a sweater and it's lined. although it's so cropped, i think the length will be attractive worn over anything that's longer.",1
"I got this top planning to wear it with the sleeves up rather than off the shoulder, like in one of the photos. my regular size (medium) was way too large so i went down to a small. however, the collar was still too wide for the sleeves to stay above my bra straps. back it goes. if you're looking for a strictly off-the-shoulder top, you might like it. color is deep blue and the cotton is a nice weight.",0
"I tried on this sweater...love the flowing top, and it looked like the seam would hit right under my bustline.
wrong.
the seam came right across my bust on a medium; sized up to a large, same thing. this shouldn't happen! not sure who this would actually flatter.
the sweater is high quality, and the colors are perfect. the fit needs work.",0
"I have a little white dog who i'm convinced sheds hair just as fast as he can grow them. i'm constantly finding white hairs on all of my clothes and have to actively work to keep my pup from lovingly brushing his sweet little head against my favorite black leggings. this sweater is exactly like my puppy. shedding for days and long after the seasons have changed it's gorgeous and the fit is lovely, but unless you're prepared to carry a lint roller with you, i would pass this by. it's very soft an",0
Runs small. arms very short and hits in the wrong place across your chest. would not recommend.,0
"Hahaha..this dress is hilarious! it looks nothing like the image! i am usually a 0/xs, and 4 was the smallest size available, so i ordered it. when i opened it, it felt like 10 lbs of fabric. i thought maybe i ordered a size way too big, until i could barely squeeze into the top of the dress. once i looked in the mirror, i almost fell over laughing. the rest of the dress is huge. i don't believe this dress would be flattering on anyone.",0
"I ordered this in an xl and when i pulled it out of the bag, it seemed huge. (i wear both l and xl, depending on the sizing) when i tried it, it did look like the photo - it's meant to be a little voluminous. the arms were a little snug, so sizing down was out of the question. it looks great tucked in to a pair of flair jeans. i gave the asthetic four stars because of the design, which is just a teeny bit off. the lace is delicate too, btw, so care will be needed not to snag it.",1
"This tunic is flattering and high quality, just be sure you size down!",1
Great top.  high quality.  could use some stretch.   recommend it!,1
"I wanted to love this top, but similar to many of retailer's styles (especially this season), this top is very large and tent-like. normally i like a larger top, but i was not expecting the length of this top. it might be cute belted if that is your style, but still much more like of a tunic than a top - could also make a nice maternity top. i am 5'7"" and ordered a medium and this top hit me much lower than pictured on the model. the fabric and pattern, as well as the neckline are very nice",1
"I received this jumpsuit today in size medium. i am normally a size 4-6. overall, the jumpsuit fit. i am 5' 8.5"" tall and the length was fine if i wore flats. the issue with this jumpsuit is the bottom half. the top jersey wrap part fit great--nice and stretchy, fit nicely on the curves. the problem is that the wrap part stops at your rib cage and the pants begin somewhere way up high, definitely on the rib cage. the gathering of the pants gave me a pooch where i don't have one, but the deal kil",0
"The design is very strange. the inner slip is quite form-fitting, but the dress on top was just massive, like a sack. on the sides were tassels that i could not figure out what to do with. they looked weird just hanging off the side, so i tried to knot them like a belt. overall, this dress was not attractive on. it looks much better on the model. the coloring on the snakeskin print dress is also different in real life, harsher red, blue, and white print not the dusty rose and plum pictured.",0
No complaints about this top. i like that it's very soft and the length is good as a tunic. would recommend.,1
"This is really a lovely jumper and looks quite nice and dressy on. my problem is a short torso, but then again this may be made for short torso loving people! i felt like i was all legs in it. i never asked anyone else's opinion, though, so not sure if its just me and my complex.
if you don't have a short torso,then you might experience the pulling the others were speaking about because the waist might hit you higher than your usual waist.

overall, i am not sure who this was designed for.. but",0
"Definitely size down it does run large however, it is a sweet floral print made of rayon so i would dry clean as rayon shrinks. i love tunic lengths and this one is a bit longer than most tunics but for me still works. there are 2 small pleats on the front and the ruffles on the neckline are a nice touch. it is made well. i have a long black sweater that will make this work right into the fall and winter.",1
"I really wanted this dress to be perfect, but the skirt portion flares out in a way that was not flattering. the other reviewer is about 8 inches taller than me, perhaps it works better on a taller frame.",0
Really wanted to love this top...it is beautiful with very good quality but...ran small and tight...also the bottom sides flare out as if it was stitched with too much material looking awkward...,0
"This dress is fun and flattering. love the pieced denim look and the a-line style. unlike other reviewers, i found this dress to be true to size for my pear-shaped figure. the length is long enough to wear anywhere, and i think it would be flattering on a variety of ages and figures.",1
"I was very patient with this dress. i was waiting almost forever till this dress gets on sale. when i tried my usual 6 size it was way too tight but i could zip it. ( i am 5'6'' 145 lbs). the dress covers my knees and it's a perfect length, so when i sit it does not show too much of my length so it's a work friendly. it has side pockets, which can be very comfortable as well. the cut is great, it's a line,the thickness of material makes belly look great (in case if you care). i also like color a",1
"I ordered this on a whim as i though, hey, i don't have off the shoulder tops let's try ti, looks cute...
i ordered the nude after debating, but glad i did, it is a bit warmer in color, and i need warm colors to complement my pale skin. teh nude almost has a slight pink hue to it (maybe i am seeing things). it is soft, not sure there is wool, i am not that sensitive to wool, felt soft to me.

size: i ordered the xxs as i think lately, retailer has been making things baggier, and on a shorter pe",1
"I love this dress because it is different and unique. i agree with others that the torso runs tight. i got lucky and it still fits snuggly. i think that's the look the upper part should get with the bottom more a-line and flowy. 
it's super cute though. the material is truly jeans material, therefore quite heavy and think. maybe not a dress for summer. more spring or fall with a little sweater.",1
I've been looking for an off the should sweater like this for over a year! looks great on and doesn't itch! can't wait for fall so i can wear it!,1
"I love holding horses and i am always be size 2 in their clothes (32dd, 5'3"", curvy). i ran into my local retailer to grab a shirt they had on hold and had to try this on because it's so cute. i couldn't get the 2 zipped and it seemed to be rather narrow in the torso. such a bummer!",0
"Based on the reviews of others, i ordered this dress a size larger than i usually wear and it fits perfect. i am an 8, so i got this in a 10. this is the perfect casual dress for pretty much anytime of the year -can be worn with sandals in the spring and summer, or boots in the winter.",1
"Love this dress. very comfortable and stylish. wanted my size. but they only had a size larger available. still bought it, but feel good in it. glad i purchased it.",1
"After reading all the reviews, i ordered up a size. the problem isn't that it runs small. it's that they took the bodice of a true size and stuck it on the skirt of a small size. or if you want to think of it differently - the bodice of a large size on to the skirt of a true size. the 4 top with the 6 bottom would be perfect. unfortunately - you get a size 4 fitted bodice with a skirt that puckers at the back and shows all your flaws (spare tire) or a size 6 that is atrociously long in the torso",0
"Tried this dress on today in the store. i am a size 10, sometimes a size 8. the size 12 was the first size i tried that zipped all the way up. however it was still very tight around my stomach and bust. and then from having to size up, it flared out too much at the bottom for my liking",0
"Having read all the reviews, i still (bravely) ordered in a size 2 (i can be a 0 or 2 in this brand)...first reaction? adorable style. second reaction? who was the model for this? i am pear shaped, and not short waisted, but the waist is low, and the top is snug...afraid a 4 would be too much top, but don't relish constantly pulling the dress down to keep the waist where it should be. am going into my local mall store, to see if they do have a 4...perhaps that will be better. really hesitant to",0
"This color is perfect: deep and rich. it is exactly as it looks on-line. the velvet is super-soft on the outside, while the inside is more of a woven finish. it makes it a little less cozy, but the drape is great. the fit is slim across the shoulders and chest, and full everywhere else. the waist is lower in the back than the front, so it sits lower on the hip. i'm 5'4, 140, 34b, and i got a small petite, because i liked where it hit my waist better. this means i won't be wearing it without tigh",1
"I can't believe the reviews this dress has gotten. i ordered it and was so excited to get it. when i tried it on all of my excitement was gone. while i love the color the quality just isn't there and its not worth the money even with the 25% discount i used. the fabric is not thick, in fact it is quite sheer for ""velvet"". i honestly wouldn't feel comfortable with out a slip on underneath this. second is the fit. i'm 5'6 32a, xs on top 4 on bottom and i ordered an xs and the way this hung on me w",0
This is the 4th pair of current/elliot jeans i've bought.  i'm 5'4 so the length is perfect for flats.  they are so soft and cozy. wish they had a design on the pockets but love them none the less!,1
"I returned this one. i usually love cecilia prado? s artistic textiles and was very happy with her floraknit dress, but this skirt was a disappointment . it simply looks different from the picture : it?s way more shimmery- metallic in person, (which i could see a lot of customers actually loved), but to me it made it look cheap. also it lacks structure: the a-shape looks drab on this knit fabric.",0
"Fit, length and design were perfect. i took this skirt on a recent business trip and it transitioned perfectly from meetings to cocktail with an accessory change.",1
"These are very cute leggings. i love the ribbed bottoms. as far as design and comfort, they are a five. but after only two wearings, they are pilling like crazy and look shabby. i'm very happy i only paid $23 for them. if i paid full price, i'd be more upset.",0
"This is a beautiful sweater. the color is not bright red, rather a dark coral. nonetheless it is much better looking in person than in the web photo. i only have one complaint which may be reason enough for me to return an otherwise perfect sweater. i wore this for approximately three hours today and could not believe the pilling under the arms and side of chest area. some pilling is normal and expected on any sweater but if this continues at the rate it appears to be going, i will contact retailer",1
"This skirt is gorgeous- the picture doesn't do it justice. it has beautiful sparkle and glitter in the material. i received tons of compliments on it. the biggest downside is the material- it seems to snag and pull so easily. in a short 2 hours of wearing it, the material was already pulled in two different places. i will keep the skirt because it is so pretty but have to not get upset when the material gets worse over time.",1
"I love this dress--i saw it on the way out of the store and was struck by the gorgeous color and rich velvet fabric and had to touch it and then try it on. i did not find it to be tight in the shoulders at all, nor do i think it looks cheap--on the contrary. the shape is indeed boxy, but it is still very flattering and comfortable. i wore it to a christmas brunch and got a ton of compliments. the only drawback for me is that it has to be dry cleaned. for reference, i am 5'6 1/2"" and usually wear",1
"Got this dress in the mail today, and will have to say that it is not the most figure flattering dress i own. my 5'5"" athletic frame looks pretty boxy in this. that being said, the fabric is a soft, shiny blue/green. the garment swings nicely and has a slightly lower hem in the back (on me, anyway) and i think that's fun. who needs close fitting clothes during the holidays ? i'm keeping it. i plan to wear it with hot pink tights and boots.",1
"I ordered these along with the regular ag stevie jeans and there is a definite difference in fabiric and cut. i liked the darker fabric but it was thinner and stretchier that the more ""denim"" version. the cut was also looser in the thigh and seat area which made for a looser, less flattering fit. returned it and kept the regular ag stevie.",0
I was not a fan of these leggings. these were very unflattering. i could see that after wearing these all day they could start stretch out. i just didn't feel like they would hold up for even one season.,1
"These jeans look slouchy and shorter in the pic which was exactly what i was looking for, but they fit more like regular boot cuts on me and proved to be much longer than expected. i have fairly long legs and most jeans hit me like they do on the models, but these were very long. i only buy citizens of humanity and paige jeans and i can almost always buy online for them when it comes to skinny jeans, but these did not fit the same as their other styles. they are good quality and would probably f",0
"I tried this on in the store yesterday and i wanted to buy it very much. the jacket would work well for many sleveless tops or dresses all summer, and would work in an office. but, on me, the unusual cut of the arms emphasized the worst part of my arms (saggy or fat area) in a comical manner. if they tried to design a garmet to make arms look bad, the couldnt have done it better. further, the extra material against the body added bulk at my narrowest point (i am hourglass). again, not flattering",1
This skirt is a dream. so so beautiful. looks way cute with brown boots. give this a go. don't listen to any negative review. this skirt is perfection.,1

"I thought these were pretty on the website, but in person they look like a work of art! the colors are vivid -- bright reds, pinks, greens, blues, yellow -- with flora, fauna, houses, writing, type and so many other things on a white and cream background. they are very soft, medium-weight flannel. for me they run true to size. i wish they had pockets, though!",1
"I've tried or bought nearly every retailer cashmere sweater this season. this one fits the best and the yellow is a bit darker in person, not quite mustard but a deep rich yellow. i wish they would offer more colors.",1
"I was really excited about this sweater, but the fit was terrible. the sleeves were the right size, but the body of the sweater was a tent - absolutely no shape. they must have clipped the sweater on the model. for reference, i'm 5'4 and 120 pounds and ordered a size small.",0
"Beautiful color, great style/design. only drawback is it's not as soft as other cashmere i've purchased...got the xs and the fit is perfect!",1
"I love cashmere, love the length, cowl-neck and colors, however i found the yellow to be bit more vibrant in person, which i liked. i'm not sure i will keep this because it seemed to be a bit too thin for my taste. i would gladly pay a bit more for a thicker ply sweater... i might justify this one at a sale price.",0
"Beautiful piece, very well made and drapes well!!! i love it!!!! runs a little big, i'd go a size smaller.",1
I bought this blouse in a size 4 (my normal size) to pair with winter white slacks and gun metal pumps. it was a hit. i felt beautiful and professional. and received many compliments at work as well as at an after work gathering the quality is surprisingly sturdy given the lace work. the collar and cuffs really set the design off. this top is much more impressive in person.,1
"This skirt is gianormous! i usually take an xl or l, so i ordered both. the waistband on the xl was so huge, i didn't even try it on. i feared it would not stay up! so i tried the large, and it was big as well. i think i would have needed a medium. but as it is, it is not the cute a-line that appears in the picture. (i wonder how they even got it to look like that !?!?!) it is huge, hip-y, and bunchy. yuck.",0
"Bought the aqua because sizes were sold out. the bright color will be a welcome change this winter among all my neutrals. it's lovely, soft, well-fitting, and i only hope we have a few days in the south so i can wear it. well worth the price. would be a lovely wardrobe addition for any age, changed by what it's worn with...shoes, accessories,",1
"I recently ordered this and am so glad i did. i absolutely love it! my hips and butt are not tiny, so i was very nervous that this would be a giant pouf on my lower half, but it lays perfectly flat and has a very gentle a-line, contrary to other comments. i am 5'4"" and 130' but the xs fits perfectly and keeps me looking trim. the waist sits just barely below my natural waist. very happy with this purchase; would buy more if there were additional colors - who doesn't love an elastic-waisted skirt",1
Very small! so disappointed! they did not even have a size for me to exchange a day later when they arrived!,0
"I ordered this online, and when i opened the package, i was impressed with the quality of the material and stitching for this top. it is much nicer than a basic t-shirt.

when i tried this on, the band of stitching that was supposed to go beneath my chest was sitting on top of my cleavage! also, the overall length is listed as 27"" long, but i think that is the back of the shirt. the front of the shirt is very short on me (i'm 5'10""), hitting well above my hip bones.

if only this was much, m",0
"I purchased this in the light red, and love it!!! this top is so incredibly soft and ridiculously comfortable.  definitely worth buying.  the material is high quality and can easily shift from season to season.  wear alone with shorts and wedges for summer or put it over a long sleeve top,  or even a holding horses jean shirt with a pair of black leggings and boots for fall.  
absolutely love the softness and the consistency of the fabric.",1
These shorts are very flattering. will def. purchase another pair.,1

also, since the material is thin, the ivory is too shear for my liking.",0
"These shorts are comfortable and are just the right length. i have the blue and it isn't as bright as shown in the pictures, but it's a great color nonetheless that coordinates well with many wardrobe items. when i tried on my usual 25, i found the waist fit a bit snug so i bought the 26 for a comfortable fit. i should've stayed with my usual size though, because after wearing for an entire day, the shorts loosened up quite a bit and developed a saggy look to them. i'm so disappointed with this",1
This dress is so beautiful in person. i actually am currently wearing it with jeans and i get so many compliments on it. this picture on the website does not really do it justice. very flowy beautiful top/dress.,1
"This is another ""i've been looking"" for me - a funnel-neck sweatshirt to feign athleticism with. i love it. the material is incredibly soft and warm. the fit is a little snug around a larger bust, and the lines would probably be more flattering on a more... well, modelesque... frame. but i'm thoroughly attached. size up if you're looking for movement.",1
I ordered it online so i wasn't sure how thick the sweater coat would be and when i received it i was pleasantly surprised at the thickness and high quality. definitely worth the price!,1
"This top does run large. i'm 5'8 142 lbs and usually a medium. i bought a small and probably could have gone xs. that said, i love this top. its soft and comfy and swingy. i bought the light red and its pretty true to the online color.",1
"Love the length, cut, & placement of pockets. the stretch has positive & negative consequences, though. minuses: easily wrinkled, grow 2 sizes within the day. pluses: comfy, bendy, they're designed to be more of an active short, so the wrinkles & give are quite fine (they only stretch in unnoticeable areas). if we're to repurchase, i'd size down--but i love the bright color  & comfort so much i'm keeping these as is. (i'm a 6-8, should have purchased the 27's.)",1
Legs are too wide. the fabric is rough to the touch.,0
Love these shorts - got 2 pairs on sale just because it's hard to find shorts that fit nicely and are comfy with a great length.,1
"I love this skirt. the material is soft and beautiful. i love wearing it with black tights and boots. the skirt is quite a bit longer than how it appears on the model, however (unless the model is 10 ft tall!). i am 5'2"" and if i place the skirt under my ribs, it reaches right above my knee. it works though and doesn't look bad. i would still recommend you buy this!",1
"This suit was high quality, and a cute design. however, it is clearly made for a lean body type.",0
This is a great quality product with unique design,1
"I was very excited about ordering this top as i'm tall girl (6 ft) and i like my back well covered. i liked both style and design of the top on photo but when the package arrived i was very disappointed with the material. this top is incredibly thin and see through. though fabric is nice and soft, it feels more like a pajama top. all curves & bumps immediately stand out and it doesn't look flattering. i ordered 2 colors grey and black size large and returned both, although they were true to size",0
"This is definitely my go to top for work, weekends or night out with the husband. i've worn it with skinny jeans, black tights and skirts. it goes with just about anything. easy to accessorize with a simple long chain necklace or a statement piece. i think the gray combo was a bit more flattering than the green combo.",1
Cute tunic.  fits on the fitted side but i love it with a vest layered over. nice material.,1
"This long sleeved tee is soft and beautiful. the swing design is so pretty and flattering. the seams along the front and back are a lovely addition. i also appreciate the higher neckline, which is increasingly hard to find in these kind of tees. would love it in more colors. i bought the black. i tried the white as well, but it was too transparent for this particular style and the tank top underneath gave it a sporty appearance. not horrible, but not what i wanted, so the white went back.",1
"The suit is lovely, but it is very long in the torso and gaps at the leg. i was told that it runs small and to size up to a 10. i did, but i do not think the smaller one would have done better. the bust is fake and it turns out when untied. worst of all it emphasizes the tummy. all in all not a good look for me. i am not heavy but i do need tummy support. normally i wear an 8 and in garnet hill a 6. sorry but it went back. i really wanted to like it.",0
"Love this shirt. i have it in black.  i have a larger chest, but i don't feel like the seams hit me wrong.  this is super cute and swingy.  i however think the price is way too high for a think cotton tee.",1
"I'm 5.1 and always bought 27p. they didn't have petite anymore, so i bought 27r, knowing that it'll hit my ankle instead of being cropped. it's very cute as an ankle-length with some flare. my only issue is that the 27r was very tight around the crotch and upper thigh. it's a very tight fit just right there!... and not enough of stretch to be comfortable when sitting. i wonder if it will stretch out a bit more from wear? i then ordered a 28r to see if that fits better, and it fits a tad loose ev",1
"This chambray is super soft! it has such a great feel and texture. i love the detail and design on the front. it adds just the right amount of interest without making the top feel busy and still very neutral in color so you can dress it many different ways. i'm not sure how this fits in comparison to other holding horses shirts/tops, but i had to size up one from my typical retailer size because of the my (which isn't large!). so excited to get a lot of use out of this!",1
"This is the most intricate, delicate, beautiful dress i have seen in a long time! the pale blue, coppery brown, and dark purple tones are so complimentary of fair skin, dark hair, and light eyes. unfortunately my normal size was far too snug, especially on my hips, and this is now sold out. the fabric has no give, so i would say with any curves, size up if you can find this beauty. i'm heartbroken to be returning it!",1
"Based on other customer reviews, i ordered these trousers expecting a lightweight cropped pant that would be appropriate for spring and especially summer. however, the fabric is much heavier than what i'd usually wear in the summer . the cut of the trousers were superb though - i like a low-rise or hipster cut which these are.

they are fitted and not oversized like many of the other retailer items i buy, so if you are an xs these will be xs (or runs small for retailer clothing) if you like your clo",0
"I bought this tunic over christmastime at full price. i absolutely adore it! in my opinion, it isn't too thick or too thin. i got my usual size large and i think it fits perfectly! there are side slits, so it's perfect with skinny jeans or leggings. it's flattering because of the vertical stripes in the fabric. also with the grey color, there is a difference in the two fabrics that are used in the construction, so this adds some additional visual appeal. i haven't had any problems with snagging",1
Not a pretty blouse - it's quite utilitarian in design - and it runs enormous.,0
"It's thin knit with a unique and pretty neckline, but unfortunately it's scratchy will not last. i just received it and it looks like it would fall apart after a few wears. it's a nice shade of offwhite at least. for me it's a no that will get sent back straight away.",0
"I was so excited to order this top - it looked like it was made of more sturdy, soft cotton, but sadly after receiving it today i found that to not be true. it's incredibly sheer - you'd have to wear a cami underneath, which defeated the point for me. the pleating in the front hides your bra, but you can see it from all other angles (i tried it on with an unlined nude lace bra, which can easily hide under sheer clothing). i was hoping to be able to wear it on its own without a cami and for it to",0
"This is a lovely jacket. it is easily paired with different bottoms and tops, and is such a fun take on the standard blazer with the beautiful ruffle pocket-detail. they are not actual pockets though, which i thought would have been an easy thing to incorporate. my chief issue with the fit is that it is a tad boxy. i am a standard xs/xxs and this runs just a tad big and a bit wide. but unbuttoned it falls seamlessly. if you use the clasp, it actually looks bigger. regardless, i love it and was o",1
"I really like this blouse. it's hard to find a short sleeved button down that the sleeves don't stick out and look weird. this one does not have this problem. it is a bit sheer, but i don't mind wearing a cami with it. it is flowy... but not boxy/baggie. has a very nice, flattering drape. i'm 5'3"", 110lbs., 32c, petite frame. the 00 regular fits great. i'm often a petite (especially in pants and long sleeved tops)... but went with the regular size here bc i wanted the longer length.",1
"I bought this suit based on the great reviews. i was so bummed when i tried it on. the top fit so well but the bottom kept bunching up. my torso is on the longer side so maybe that's why the bottoms keep coming up. every time i pulled the shorts down, the top would come down too, and vice versa. i am 5'5 and 120lbs and bought a 2 which is my normal size. i did like that the top had a bit of padding but that's the extent of what i liked about it. i will be returning it.",0
"When i read all these positive reviews i did not hesitated, as i wanted good basics which will be good investment in me as looking good is always investment. well, i love blue color as i am blonde wih blue eyes and this color makes my eyes brighter and matches almost everything but..the design of the shirt is made oversize fit basically the shirt should not be dressed as fitted it's more relaxed fit so if you wear medium go head and order medium even if the small fits unless you want to look lik",0
The weight and drape of this shirt is wonderful. it is very comfortable while still being flattering. you could wear it with jeans and sneakers or heels. fits true to size and the navy color is very deep.,1
Runs large. very boxy. white fabric on lower portion of the shirt extremely thin. it did not look as good as in in picture. very disappointing!,0
"I love this dress so much - comfortable, flattering and really pretty. i wish i could buy this dress in every color!",1
"I am 5'3"", 28/38 and got the sp. had no issues whatsoever, and love the colors.",1
"I love this dress. like another reviewer said, it's the perfect teacher dress. i wore it on the first day of school. it's comfortable and flattering and super cute. i received lots of compliments.",1
"This is an adorably gorgeous swing dress. the fabric is soft and flowy, and everything a swing dress should be. i was concerned that it would be too short, but it's the perfect length-fun while still being classy. a nice, chunky, eccentric bib necklace and nude sandal wedges would complete this outfit beautifully. highly recommend!",1
"I love the fabric and pattern of this dress so much that i decided to keep it (got it on mega sale), but i would have never paid full price or anything close. the armholes are enormous, showing bra and all. i am not particularly large chested (34c), and the buttons are stretched to gaping on me, even with the huge armholes. i have a cute red sweater coat that i will wear over it all fall, but i could not recommend it because of the poor cut design.

pros: great pattern, fabric, pockets, true to",0
"I am a 36dd, 10/12 in tops and 12/14 in bottoms.

i tried both the navy/red pattern and the green polka dot. color and patterns on both are gorgeous. the fabric is very comfortable and a nice fit on the bottom half. size large fit perfectly in the waist however i had gapping across the bust. size xlarge fit ok in the front of the bust, but was loose in the back, gapping at the neck, and the waist was very loose. cute and comfy but only recommended for smaller busted gals.",0
The cut of the top portion of the dress is off. i tried on the s in-store & it bunched up in the breast area. i ordered a sp hoping the petite would fix the problem - nope - still bunched up. for reference i am a 34b. i would have kept the dress and given 5 stars if it wasn't for said flaw.,0
"I had been searching for an almost 50s style dress and i saw this one and instantly loved it. i wind up sending back so many things i get through retailer but this dress was everything i hoped it would be. i got the green one with the white dots. very comfortable, it just out a little with the hips because of the cut which is very 50s styling--it makes the waist look more narrow...",1
"I was expecting an ivory/white cardigan with some lace along the sides with a more slim fit. i am 138 lbs, 36b and normally wear a s or m so i ordered a m. the sweater is at least 1 or 2 sizes too large in my opinion and not at all a slim fit but more of boxy fit.

the lace edges need to be trimmed up due to raw edges and strings hanging from them. also the color is difficult to detect online but i was surprised to see that it is ivory with gray stripes. not unpleasant but not as pictured. as",0
"This is a very fetching little dress but the details of the fit, as described by other reviewers, is slightly off. i am 34d 5'5 and 140 lbs. the top fits perfectly but has an odd gap at the button placket. the fabric is nice enough but not exactly as i expected. one must have a very flat stomach as the top of the dress is not forgiving at all. the dress just wasn't me, i guess, so this one is going home to retailer...",0
"This top is quite boxy and i was very disappointed with the color, it looked as if i'd washed it in filthy water. it's a very dingy white, needless to say it went back.",0
"I love finding cute tops on sale that have great potential, but just need a little altering. i bought this one in my usual size medium and took it in 2 inches on both sides. it's still a looser fit, but much cuter. i didn't want to size down fearing it would be too tight in the shoulders and underarms. it's also a softer cotton fabric (similar to brushed cotton) rather than the crisp cotton most white button down shirts are made of.",1
"I really love the pattern and the look on the model, and i thought i would love it. i ordered online, so i did not try on in store. when i tried it on, it has way too much fabric around the waist and skirt. it is thick fabric as well, and has a lining, and the waist has extra fabric for the design, and it has pockets, so it all adds up to be way too bulky. it is not flattering at all and made me look 10 pounds heavier. i am returning this dress. sad, because it looks so lovely on the model. i am",0
"This tunic looks awesome in the picture. however, it is made of an uncomfortable sweater-like material not left of centers normal skin cotton. i was disappointed once i saw this in person. not a great material for summer.",0
"Like a previous reviewer, i love white blouses -- nothing better. also love polka dots, so i grabbed this at my retailer store the minute i saw it without even trying it on. quality is good; nice material. maybe a little heavy for summer. but it really didn't work on me. i normally wear a small in tops, however with a 34d chest (5'5"" 122 lbs) i do sometimes get a bit of gapping with blouses at the chest. this does not gap but it just hangs on me. if it was a true peplum and fitted at the waist i t",0
This is my favorite top! i'm a 36d and usually wear a medium or large. i love this paired with skinny jeans or my level 99 blue shorts.,1
"Love this top so much. it's very unique and one of those tops that's ""effortless"" to wear. i was expecting it to be boxy because of what other reviewers had written, but i find it to be flattering and comfortable. i'm glad i ordered the small because i do think the medium (my usual size) would have been too big.",1
"I really liked this top but when i tried it on it was big and too boxy. i considered ordering it in petite but the sales person said that the cut would be the same, boxy but shorter so i decided to pass.",0
"What a beautiful dress! after reading all the other reviews i ordered a size small petite. way too big. the dress sagged down so the waist was at my hips. there was a good 4 inches that i could've taken in. in addition the arm holes showed my entire side of my bra. even if i sized down to an xsp my bra would be visible. such a pity because i loved the blue motif.

no issues with the zipper as others have mentioned

for reference i'm 5'2"" 107 lbs average proportions.",0
"Wanted to love this- i did love the color and thought the style would work for anyone. but i tried it on and immediately took it off with a definite ""not keeping this."" the side zipper- a complaint by many, really made it uncomfortable. also, the detail under the bust would not lay flat and just looked odd. loved the material and definitely the green print. but i knew i would never wear it. just looked blah.",0
"I was so excited for another fun white shirt. this was fits the bill! its cute, it does run alittle boxy maybe a hair large. it is also not white, white, has a touch of ivory. still, is a great top with skinny jeans. received a compliment yesterday while getting coffee, the lady was going online to get one for herself!",1
I'm usually a small but the skirt of the dress was a bit loose and added love handles to my figure when i wear it. a smaller size would work better. it's cute and i love it but the material is form fitting and do a larger size isn't flattering. an xsmall for me,1
"Fun , flirty, feminine!! love this blouse with jeans or with a skirt or leggings! i bought both blues i liked the first and after wearing it i ordered the navy with dots along with santuary black legging pants... just love !!!highly recommend. easy to wear.",1
"I really wanted to love this romper and couldn't wait to try it on.   it's super cute and love the material but once on the top portion is way too baggy even after cinching the waist.   if i pulled the waist all the way down it looks smoother and nice,  but if it sits at my natural waist,  the back balloons out and it's unflattering.  it's too bad,  i love the print and ease of this design.",0
"Ahhh, i should have listened to previous reviews. indeed, this top runs very large. style wise, it is ok. i would say you could do much better at retailer.",0
"I found this dress to be perfect for the winter season. its warm, sleek, and classy. this dress is made in the usa so it is worth the price. i love the opening on the back and find it be flattering. it can be worn with tights for the winter and easily worn without in the summer. a wise investment for my closet!",1
"I love this romper so much! i'm a tall girl (5'9), so often times its hard for me to find a romper that isn't too short. the length on this is perfect. this romper is an adorable design and the fit is great. the material is a great quality, and its really comfortable! i'm 5'9 34b bra, i usually range between an xs and s, i went with the s on this one and it fits great! i definitely recommend this if you're thinking about it.",1
"I love love love this top. i love it so much i bought it in two different colors so i can wear it more often. i think it's feminine, chic, and classic. i've worn it several times and i each time i've had more than one person comment on it. i normally wear a small but they only had it in an extra small and i actually like how it fits which is why i think it runs a little large. the only place that it is a bit small is the cuffs at the end of the sleeves. i usually just unbutton those anyway so no",1
"I just got this top and can't wait to wear it for spring/summer! it is a lovely lightweight material and hangs loosely and comfortably. it definitely runs quite large so i would at the very least consider ordering on the small side of what you normally wear if not sizing down one completely. this is coming from someone who usually likes tops on the roomier side, so trust me on this! overall, i highly recommend this top if you're looking for a muted but unique, comfy top for the warmer months ahe",1
"I love this sweater coat. i just put on a pair of leggings and boots and i'm good to go. it's warm and flattering and comfortable and i can wear it anywhere, it works at the office, out to eat, shopping or even just hanging around.

fit: some of the other comments mention the small waist. this is a fitted sweater, not a roomy piece for layering over other pieces. i like the fit because i get the warmth of a big sweater without the bulk. the fit is similar to dresses that i have purchased at anth",1
I'd been wanting the blouse for quite a while but hesitated based on reading reviews. when it went on sale i thought i'd try but it was like a tent on me. the fabric was pretty but just hung without any resemblance to photo. too bad because the color was gorgeous & could have been a favorite of looked like photo.,0
"This blouse is a beautiful color and i love the dot design and texture. however, it is a much baggier fit than i expected based on the photo, and it looks a little bit like a maternity shirt on me. i usually wear a size 8 or 10 and i bought a size medium.",0
"I have been needing a rain coat and saw this one on sale, so decided to try it on. i do wish it was more ""fitted"", but it is pretty cute. the embroidered detail is nice. too bad the xs petite is sold out. i have no idea if it will hold to the rain though...",1
This sweater coat is very bulky and has an odd and unflattering shape when on.,0
"I'm 5'7"", 130 lbs. i ordered a medium-regular. the dress fell three inches above my knees. this model is taller than i am, and it falls to her knees....doesn't make sense. i think retailer sends petites in place of regular.",0
"Although i am small (size xs on top, 27 waist) this dress is not flattering if have any fat on your body....i would not recommend it.",0
"I'm usually a petite, but bought in regular xs. perhaps a petite would have worked better, but this was way too low cut in front and back. i did not like the way it hung on me at all. i'm 5;2"" and 105 lbs, but regular xs normally fits better than this did. i could barely keep the shoulders from slipping off. sorry, it's a return for me.",0
"While this is gorgeous in person, if you have a larger bust the v-neck will look really weird. because its so deep, it gets skewed(i'm a d cup). if only the v were 1 or 2 inches higher! unfortunately it's going back.",1
"Bought it on sale and i am keeping it. it is well made an the material seems to be of good quality. however, i believe this would be more flattering on someone less curvy - less hips, smaller bust - as it makes me look slightly pregnant. still, i am keeping it to use on those days i just don't feel like dressing up for work. i bought a large (i'm a 36-38c), but i think i could've gotten away with a medium.",1
This dress looks so elegant and perfect for transition from work to night. it looks great on the model but it looked terrible on my. it's a lovely material but the middle added girth to my stomach area which i did not care for.,0
This top is perfect! very comfortable and flattering for any body type.,1
"I was disappointed when the dress came in the mail. it was much shorter on my than on the model in the picture. (i am 5'5"") the detail of the dress and fabric shown in the picture is not as prominent in person which was also disappointing. the dress is just average. i didn't not return the dress...it looks much better on my younger sister (who is the same height) so i gave it to her. i guess it's just not the right dress for me.",1
I tried this in the store and i liked it. the color is very pretty and the fabric is soft and drapey and feels like good quality. i like the little subtle dots. i ultimately did not buy it because the tie at the throat is not my style and because i just don't need this kind of piece enough in my wardrobe at the moment. but it is a very nice top and i would recommend it if you like the color and style.,1
After reading the previous reviews i thought sizing down would be a great idea. as soon as i pulled it out of the bag i knew that the xs/s was still wayyy too big. for reference i am 5'3 and a 34ddd and usually wear an 8 but this thing was enormous. it was shapeless and boxy but done so horribly it looked like i was pregnant. it has an adjustable draw string at the bottom which helps to make you look like a balloon. such a disappointment. the design was lovely and it looked very high quality and,0
"This looks great on the model but when it arrived, i couldn't believe it was the same jacket. it looks a bit like a really loose garbage bag on me and no amount of adjusting drawstrings is going to fix it. i really wanted to like it, but even the xs/s was too baggy. also a bit worried based on other reviews that it isn't actually a rain jacket and wont keep you dry.",0
I never write reviews,0
"I've got the post-baby bulge and this dress makes me the hottest i've looked in a long time! fitted, but skimming where i don't want to be accentuated - it's a rare dress that can pull this off! the cleavage is there, so i think it's more of a night dress, but i'd wear it with a sweater during the day. very comfortable.",1
"Saw this on line and decided to ""splurge"" for the holidays. arrived today and is going right back. runs very small especially in the waist. trim is a cheap ribbed fabric with a zipper. fabric is not elegant looking as in the picture, appears cheap and very itchy. sooooo disappointed.",0
"This dress was ok - i thought the fabric was soft, but not my favorite. it's a pull on dress that would be easy to dress up or down. but, i have bigger hips and this dress was really not flattering on my - would be better on a different body type.",0
"I love the fabric however the overall fit did not work for me. 
i think the arms are much smaller than the overall shirt.",0
I recently bought this top in both the black and blue motifs and love it! i'm currently 7 months pregnant and this top provides great coverage for the bump. i agree with another reviewer that noted that it is a little tight in the bust as i had to go up a size for that reason.,1
I was excited about this - - such a lovely look online. but on me...it was just meh. i'm a little heavy right now so that could be playing into it...but i will say i loved the top part of the dress. very flattering and subtly sexy. but the bottom..it just hangs like a rag. it needs either more material for a swishier effect...or it needs to be a different material. or maybe knit just doesn't work on me in the form of a dress! the knit is nice but i kind of also feel like it is chintzy...i can't,0

i could barely get the top on. it looked like i was missing 1/2 of the top. i doubled checked the size and it was a large.

"I hate buying dresses because i rarely find one that fits well. i'm very petite on top (xsmall) and small/med on bottom, 5'8"". usually dresses are tight on my hips & thighs and loose up top. this fairly lightweight yet warm dress is such a winner! form-fitting yet stretchy and forgiving in all the right places. the x-small and small both fit pretty well but i decided to go with the x-small on this one. i think this will be a staple winter/fall dress. loved the fit so much i bought it in the peac",1
"It's a cute topper. it fits nicely through the shoulders and arms, and because of the a-line, through the bottom. but the chest is 3 sizes too small and i don't have a big chest. the fabric is very scratchy, and mine arrived unbuttoned and unzipped, and i suspect it had been worn.

This dress is comfortable and a great go to dress to wear to work and then after for drinks with friends.,1
"I don't mind loose-fitting clothing, but to say that this product runs large is an understatement. no amount of pulling, tying, pinching could help me get this jacket to fall the way it does on the model in the photo. the arm holes are a foot in diameter for artistic purposes, and the jacket itself is meant to flow far away from the body, i guess. if you try to taper it in with the strings, then end result resembles a rounded beach ball. very disappointed, especially since the design on the fabr",0
I was pleasantly surprised to find this piece in stock at my local store. it's a very comfortable top with plenty of room. the only criticism i have regarding it is that it's a bit maternity-esque. bought it in an xs.,1

"First off, the moment i put on, i got tons of compliments from complete strangers. it truly is a unique and pretty. i am 5'3 and originally wanted the med petite for length. they were sold out so i got the xs in the regular size. that worked out good. it is a bit snug around the shoulders but not enough to go up a size. overall, xs was a good alternative to medium petite.",1
"I'm returning this jacket. i tried it on after it was delivered, and was happy with the weight, cut, and color, although it's more dusty mauve than it looks in the picture. however, the stitching and the zipper are of such poor quality that i doubt  it will last very long. i actually can't get the zipper to zip at all. it's very rough and lightweight, and i'm afraid if i keep trying to force it i'll just end up breaking it. sorry to say yet another retailer item turns out to be poor quality.   thi",0
"I'm so happy i purchased this cardigan!! every time i've worn it i've actually gotten compliments, from both women and men:) i was slightly undecided at first due to it's quite pricey, but i think the quality is amazing and the pattern will actually last a long time as a keeper, not just a quick trend!! i'm so happy i snagged it before it ran out!!\ i have quite muscular upper arms, and the medium fits me well. the sleeves do have some give in them, and even though i'm also broad across my shoul",1
"This was a winner retailer!!!!! bought it with my birthday discount. a bit pricey, but when i wore it (over and over again) i can see why. the material is so soft, flows beautifully and is just the right length on me. i am petite (5'3"") slender at 115 and i wear it with wedge heels, just like the model. i did iron it when i took it out of the package but have not had to iron it again.

i have received many compliments on this dress. bought the washed denim look.

thank you!!!!",1
"I got this in peach, and am not ashamed to say that i wore it almost every day in the past week - over a tee, over a dress, over a tunic...it looks good with everything! my normal size s is on the looser side compared to my other retailer bombers, but i like it for layering purposes. so soft and comfy...i have a feeling i'm going to need a backup of this one!",1
"The pattern is actually knitted into the fabric instead of just printed on like i've sometimes found; the embroidery mostly serves as a highlighting feature instead of a focus. the inside of the cardigan is another layer of fabric, sort of like a double knit? but with its own, simple striped pattern. the collar looks like it might be itchy, but it only is until it gets stretched out a bit and arranged properly.",1
"I'm 60+, in relatively decent shape, 135 lbs, and size 6 is perfect. i went for the regular rather than petite sizing, which came well below my knees, and although i would usually have a sheath dress like this hemmed up to that slim part right at the bottom of the knee, the slim silhouette shape served to lengthen the profile as a longer dress, so i left it about 3"" below the knee. the stretch allows it to hug the body, and with the right undergarments, it is super comfortable and attractive. go",1
"This sweater is so lovely.. i like the fact that it's not super heavy, so you can be comfortable with a layer under it. the embroidery is beautiful. i usually get petite sizes when available, but the petite m was sold out when i purchased. i went with regular medium and am actually glad. it's not overwhelming or too long (i'm 5'2"").. in my opinion. if you're on the fence, go for it. totally worth it..",1
"And this one has a heavenly feel to it. i know it's not 100% cashmere, but it's soft and cozy. i love the understated colors and plan to wear it with a neutral/creme sweater. perfect to take from fall into winter.",1
"Just purchased this sweater in store as a christmas present for my self and i'm in love! i feel the fit besides the shoulders which are somewhat narrow, is perfect. i usually wear a petite medium in everything but had to go with the regular small because they didn't have petites in the store. i tried on the regular medium and it was just slightly too big everywhere. overall i am so pleased with this purchase. so happy i popped into retailer today and saw it!",1
"When i first saw this in the retailer catalog, i thought it was beautiful. i am a sucker for floral prints, and unique color combinations, both of which this top has. i'm 5'3"", 120 lbs and a small bust at 32b, i usually wear a size 2 but it was a little loose all around so i'd say it runs big. they had the size 2 at a low sale price in my local store so i bought it without hesitation. it's a little loose but very flattering and very good quality, i definitely recommend it if your shape is s",1
I so badly wanted this dress to work for me. the material and color is so beautiful. this had a 'sack like' fit and the side pockets accentuated my hips giving me a broader look than i would like.,0
"I ordered an xs regular and it barely skims the floor when i'm wearing wedges or heels - perfect! it's form fitting but not clingy, and i think it's a pretty, comfortable dress. glad i made the purchase!",1
I bought this dress to wear to a funeral. i usually wear a medium but when i tried it on it was way too big so i exchanged it for a small which fit perfectly! the side slits make the dress a bit sexy and the styling is boxy but very comfortable especially with the pockets! the fabric lies beautifully on the body. i would recommend this dress.,1
"This jacket is just too small for me anyway and i am no way big. i am tall and athletic and this thing looked like it had shrunk in the wash. there are so many better fitting other types out there, this went back",0
"1. i'm 5'5"" tall, 140 lbs and 38 (36d) - 32- 40. i'm normally a size 10 in most brands, and in maeve in the past. this dress was too tight across my waist and hips in a size 12, so it runs very slim.

2. this dress is very long waisted, so the top bunched up funny.

3. the horizontal bar in the back is in the wrong place, and will not hide your bra strap.

4. there are bra strap keep loops in the shoulders, but this is an off the shoulder top.

5. the underarms bunched funny.

6. the dress has h",0
"This skirt fits me like a glove, you must get the matching top and orange jacket that makes the whole outfit high
fashion fun chic. i am 5' 8"" and 145 full figured and imlove this out fit. very cozy too.",1
The dress is well made with a great material. it is extremely long and unless you are tall it would overpower many petite women. i returned it.,0
"Birthday gift from my husband, and i have it hanging up where i can see it, the design is like a huge beautiful tapestry. although it looks heavy, the cotton has a nice feel to it. hand-embroidered here and there. i usually wear size s/m and the med. is very comfortable. gorgeous!",1
"I love the color and cut of the pants. they are more a dark indigo twill than a jean, to be sure. a fit issue is how the front pockets pop out because of the excessive stretchiness of the fabric. i wear them and love them, but stitched the front pockets closed to avoid the unflattering pop-out pockets.",1
"Wow... i'm in love!!! when i first saw this i put it in my cart... when i went back to purchase it, it was sold out in my size... i was so bummed. i kept checking back and saw it was restocked so i quickly ordered it... thank heavens!!! when i first took it out of the box i thought it might be too ""grandma-y"" of a design... but i was wrong. it's just gorgeous! can totally be dressed up or down. so flattering. love love love it!!!",1
"Woke up this morning to an email from retailer showcasing this gorgeous jacket. i knew i had to have it. trying it on in the store, it did not disappoint! hei hei is a really wonderful brand, and me being a more plus sized gal, their sizing is always wonderful. i normally do an xl in most retailer jackets and tops,..but i was able to do a l well. the arms have plenty of room and the body of the jacket has a room as well (like your typical bomber would). the fabric is soft and the blush color",1
"Soft, comfortable and well made. great with sleeves rolled or down for cooler weather. interesting color- close to picture, maybe a little more orange. goes well with blues and grays.",1
"I usually wear a medium, and this jacket was no exception. the jacket is a shorter style as pictured. it is still flattering, even though it is a little boxy. i got the grey, which is a dark gray/slight greige color. if you like edgier over boho, this is a cute transitional jacket.",1
Love the tegan tunic version of this dress. i assumed since it looked identical except for the length that the sizing was the same but i was wrong. this runs so big! i got a s in the tegan but the s in this dress looked like an oversized potato sack on. i highly recommend ordering at least 2 sizes down unless you want to look tent-y.,0
"These jeans have definitely made me an ag convert. the fit is perfection and at 5'3"", it is so to buy jeans and simply wear them (without the typical extra 4-6"" of length).",1
"I bought this jacket in the gray and couldn't be happier with it. it is loose fitting but not oversized. it will look great over a dress with boots, or with jeans. very versatile piece.",1
"I don't own any peach outerwear because i didn't think it would complement my skintone. this cozy bomber proved me wrong. wonderful quilting pattern and a vintage dye job that's eye catching. great for layering and the color goes with my autumn and spring wardrobe. this is not a fitted style, it's relaxed and a bit poufy at the sleeves and waist, just like a regular bomber jacket. i chose medium petite and it fits just right. i'm a 36d, 135#, 38-28-35.",1
"Ordered it in small regular and xtra small petite. what was surprising was that the xtra small petite fit better (meaning more room) across the chest. i'm normally a medium or medium petite, but this runs large. if you're unsure of a size, get both and return the one that doesn't fit as well. it's much better in person and looks very rich in colors and quality. the only complaint i have is there were some loose yarn pieces just dangling off the edges. i trimmed up with scissors and they didn't e",1
"I'm happy the other reviewers made this dress work because it looked terrible on me. i'm 5,9"" and 128 lbs and it made me look like i had gained 25 lbs. as others have said, the pockets make the dress even worse-it's very hard to get them to lay flat. the material is lovely, soft and i liked the gray color, but this dress made me feel like i was wearing something from an asylum.",0
"Great sweater to brighten those gloomy winter days. this is a beautiful sweater, soft, colorful. perfect.",1
Love the jacket! so versatile! would probably order up a size if you like a loose fit.,1
"Loved this from the minute i saw it in an email. i got the blue grey in a medium. i'm 5'4"", 140. it's a little roomy but will be nice over sweaters too. i love the cropped length. really well made.",1
"Gorgeous color and fit, but fabric is not great. i ordered this to wear with leggings and booties. i returned as i could tell it would get baggy in the elbows and rear end. just not a good fabric. bummer!!!!",0
This is beautiful on. it flatters the figure nicely. the material is a rougher cotton which seems oppressive for summer even though thin. it is very low cut but it looks wonderful.,1
"Absolutely stunning top! love! what a great buy on sale! i wear a medium/large and purchased the size 12...fits perfect! beware that the bottom has somewhat of a flair! the material is light so i would say this top is something to be worn transitioning between seasons, late summer to fall!",1
"I'm thinking that this might be a hit for the petites out there, but it didn't quite work on my long torso. the seam across the bust fell a little too high making the shirt ride up and the sleeve ended at a weird spot (not quite 3/4 sleeves, and also not long sleeves...but there is a band that makes it feel weird). the v-neck in the front is low, but offered full coverage on my 34a bust, but i can see it being pretty revealing on someone better endowed. fabric and color is nice, and it's a prett",1
"I love the ethnic colors & the creative woven design of this garment. that's what attracted me in the first place. however, some of the metallic threads had snagged & i thought the loose weave & acrylic yarns would lead to more snags & it would eventually stretch out of shape. also, it's very big. too bad it doesn't come smaller. in the online picture, it must have been gathered & clipped behind the model because it really doesn't fit close like that & the long armholes are not visible online as",0
"Bought this in navy - going to buy another one in a different color!  it fits my curves beautifully!  does not look ""boxy"" like other tunic sweaters.  i also disagree with other reviews, i cannot see through it.",1
"This sweater is super flattering. love the cowl neck and longer length. it is not boxy or shapeless, but manages to show off your figure without clinging anywhere. i did not find any of the colors to be see through as some other reviewers had noted.  i purchased the navy and think i'll go back for the brown as well!  size down if between sizes.  i am 5'7"" and busty, and the medium fit great.",1
"I really had high hopes for this sweater however, unfortunately it is not as nice as i expected it to be. i own a few angel of the north sweaters and i really don't feel like this particular sweater meets their usual standard. first of all the yarn feels very cheap and is not very soft. secondly, the actual knit also appears to be very cheap. i ordered the white sweater in my usual size medium and while it fits, i really can't see how they were able to get the neck of the sweater to go off the m",1
"This top looked positively vulgar on!!!! i am a 34d, and it was way too low cut...my boobs were spilling out!!! in addition, the fabric reminded me of a cheese cloth.....it just looked and felt cheap. unfortunately, this top will be going back.",0
"I ordered a large and despite wearing a large in many other items from antrhopologie, this item was too small, especailly across the bust. it was very well-made and the color green is beautiful, but unfortunately, i will not be able to wear it. so disappointed.",0
I usually love a cowl neck sweater but not this one. you can't wear it off the shoulders and it's weirdly sheer too. the only pro is that it doesn't include wool or fur.,0
"I have been admiring this piece for awhile and finally decided to purchase it, and i am so happy i did! the yellow is the perfect pop of color for fall/winter, but it isn't overwhelming or overpowering. fit is oversized (as is in any poncho style sweater) but it doesn't feel boxy or unflattering. if in between sizes, definitely go down. i like things oversized and i went with the xs/s and it fits great. this will be a go to piece for many years to come!",1
"I really loved the look of this dress online and couldn't wait to try it on. based on my measurements i ordered a petite medium, following the petite size chart. the dress was the perfect length for my 5'5 frame, but it was just way too loose and not flattering on my figure. i'm 36c-32-37 and i looked like a sack of potatoes in the dress. the fabric and lining feel great though. i just wasn't the right fit for me.",0
"The sweater is nice but is very thin. it is see-through which does not make it a good fall/winter item for me. the design & structure of the sweater is nice & looks slimming on which is a bonus. i originally ordered my regular size (s) but had to upgrade to a large in order to get the neck to fall on my shoulder as shown in the picture. this wasn't a problem since the sweater is form fitting so getting the larger size did not make it look too big. overall, i did not keep the seater as i thought",0
"This cape/poncho item is totally amazing. from the moment it whispered over my head as it slipped past my hair, i knew i had to have it. this piece is magical. it feels like you're wearing a blanket (the warmth factor), but the length is so perfect that it doesn't overwhelm you, nor does it make you look like a tank. the colors are amazingly saturated and the quality is so worth the price. the model is wearing it with light brown, but i tried it on over black leggings in the store and it works w",1
I am so surprised this was not styled properly in the photo! if worn the way it should be worn it would have sold out before going on sale. yes it is open down each side but you need to slide a belt inside the back so the back is left full and bring the belt out into the front on sides cinching in the front...making this a dramaticly gorgeous piece! i love it and will wear it with my leather jeans to pencil skirt. i am a personal stylist and designer and if you are thinking about this piece jump,1
"I bought the white in my usual xs size, i don't agree with some of the other reviews that say it is thin, because it is not a sweater. it is a pullover in a kind of waffle weave fabric , not a sweater knit. very cute with a flattering fit. casual wear.",1
"No, but i'm not a small person. i'm 5'8, a size 6 on top, 8 on bottom. i don't love this on the model online, but i saw this on naomi's blog, love taza, and thought it looked amazing. i tried it on in my retailer, and while they only had a m/l, since i'm tall, i figured that'd be fine. oh. no. not fine. it's huge. like, it could almost cover a twin bed. it was a couple inches longer on me than on the model, and doesn't arc down in a drape nearly as well, so just looks, huuuge. i thought i was bein",0
"Perfect dress for the hot late summer/early autumn weeks! this beauty is flowy and rich in color. the tie back is adjustable which i love due to my weight fluctuations. because of the tie, length can be adjustable too! i'm short so the decision lies on what shoes i want to wear and how high i want my hem. this dress looks cute belted or with my cropped moto jacket thrown on top. all in all, i really like this dress and i see it staying in my closet for a long while if the horrid viscose construc",1
"I disagree with the other review. i purchased the xxsp in navy and i think the sweater fits true to what is shown on the retailer-model. the sweater knit is lighter weight, it is not heavy. it fits more tightly to the body, which i like. the material is soft to me and navy color has a gray-tone to it. i did not find it difficult to wear the sweater off of the shoulders at all. if you are looking for a heavier sweater this is not for you. if you do not want a body skimming sweater this is not for y",1
"This skirt is going to be perfect for the hot texas summers. super lightweight and floaty, and the pattern is so gorgeous. will go great with my favorite purple shoes!",1
"Ordered on line and thought these are a great quality as i pulled them out of the box. tried them on and found minimal elastic for the waist. within minutes of wearing, the waist fell down past my hips...glad i was at home. looks cute but will not stay up.",0
"I absolutely love slips, and i like the grey tone of this one-and that it is not super shiny. it adds to the versatility of the slip-which i wear many ways. i wear them as under layers for long cardigans, i wear them as a real traditional slip under other dresses, and i also have been known to wear them to bed. the fabric on this one is absolutely comfortable and lightweight. i like that the fabric is cut in a babydoll format and the straps are wider (an a different color) which adds just enough",1
"I ordered these pants in my usual size (xl) and was shocked when i received them. the waist was huge and there was nothing in the way of an elastic or tie to keep them up. i couldn't keep them on so, of course, back they go! too bad! the sweater quality is great.",0
What a classy special top. really dresses up a pair of black slacks. i actually think this is a perfect spring piece!,1
"I wanted to love these, they are cute and warm - but they have absolutely no elasticity. i'm so mad at myself for not reading the reviews because i ended up wasting money on shipping 2 pairs of leggings that i ultimately took right back to the store.",0
"Pretty detail, fits nicely. i feel it runs very tts. it's a lot, though. fuzzy and detailed. it definitely takes over the outfit. i wonder about shedding as well if you pair it with dark pants or jeans...? it would be gorgeous with simple winter white pants at a holiday event. still on the fence, i don't know if its for me.",1
I saw the colors and texture of this top and wanted to love it however when i put it on it just did not work. the cut was so strange. it runs very small in the shoulders and then flairs out so much at the waist. i even ordered up a size based on reviews. i ordered an 8 when i normally where a small (6) in things. the shoulders were still too small and it was way too big every where else.,0
"Good fit, quality, similar to the brand's other jeans.",1
"This sweater was just what i was looking for.  it is so soft & comfortable.  the design is unique and delicate, yet doesn't shed or itch.  the decorations are not as pure white as pictured, there are several different tones of ivories & creams.  i ordered the xs, which is my typical size in retailer sweaters, as i find that most run very large and this is no exception.  it is oversize, but not bulky.  however, the decorations do add some volume, so maybe not for all body types.",1
"I expected to love this, since i usually look good in this style of jacket. it's definitely comfortable and the fit was fine, but i really don't care for the wooden buttons and the overall look was just ""meh."" it's going back, unfortunately.",0
"Classic retailer piece that i am so happy to have in my wardrobe. high quality all wool felt jacket. unlined, stretchy comfortable knit. i wear mine as a knit blazer and love it. it is not merino soft, but soft enough to wear over a long sleeve tee. the neck does not itch. 

fits tts, i wear a l and that is my normal retailer size. i am tempted to get the cream as well!",1
"Love the shape of this top and often look to retailer for corset-style summer tops that are pretty. this top is made from a thick, stiff fabric that doesn't breathe. so my usual size xxs was too constricting. tried an xs also and it basically fit but i still wasn't a fan of the very heavy fabric in a summer top. it's almost like a neoprene. the colors are an odd choice and not my favorite either. i wanted to see in person and they just don't cut it for me. would love in different colors and softer",0
"I recommend with reservations. these leggings are 100% wool, soft, not itchy, light weight, lovely knitted pattern. they run large. i sized down to a small. the first time i wore them they were fine. but the second time the waist stretched out and was useless: they were falling down as i walked. such a shame because everything else about them is perfect for cold winter days. they even fit under my silk skirt and would make other lighter garments wearable in winter. so what to do? at the price th",1
"The photos don't do the top justice. the split back is very unique and adorable. i typically take a size 8 in tops, but ordered a 12 since a reviewer suggested it was narrow in the shoulders. the 12 shoulder fit perfectly, but the body is way too big -- i was swimming it in. i like it enough that i'm going to visit the tailor to take in the body. with the sale price, it is worth tailoring.",1
"I really liked the fit and feel of these pants except the bottom of the pant leg was more bell shaped than i wanted (bought white pilcro culottes last year and they weren't like this), but it wasn't a deal breaker. when i got home, i tried to pair the chocolate pants with something to wear in the summer, but it wasn't working for me. i think the color was just too dark and fall-feeling. they do run big, so i'd think about sizing down ... definitely worth giving them a try if you're okay with the",1
"#childsize. not sure where this went wrong but it's going back immediately. always wear a 0-2 in retailerpologist skirts, this size 0 runs at least two sizes too small. the material is beautiful, but if i got the size i needed i would be entirely swallowed by fabric. so disappointing.",0
"I loved the look of these pants in the pictures online and i loved the way that they fit. however when i got my pair, the flower placement was completely different. the whole front was black and there were just flowers running out of the crotch seams. i ordered another pair hoping they were just cut wrong, but those were even worse. they looked obscene.",0
"I carry my weight on my lower half, usually a large in bottoms. this one in a large was too big throughout especially since it doesn't have a waste band. returned.",0
Gorgeous!! get these while you can. tts. has a lot of stretch. these are so much fun and will sell out! so happy!,1

"I have quite a few pairs of retailer pants and jeans. my favorites are the cords i got last year, similar to these, so when i saw this fun pair, i had to have them. i ordered both the 32 and the 33 to try on.

they are even more beautiful in person than online. and they are so, so small. it wasn't like they were a tad snug--i couldn't even get the button across to meet the buttonhole. on the 33.

i've never had a problem fitting into retailer pants before. this was an extra-depressing first time",0
"I love this top. i got it thinking i'd wear it mostly with jeans but turns out i have worn it with a lot more. it pairs great with cut-off shorts, white jeans, denim jeans. i have worn it tucked in with high waisted jeans for a more polished look and also un-tucked for a more casual look. i get lots of compliments on this top when i wear it. i think it could be worn into fall with a jacket over it. very happy with it!",1
"A truly unwearable slip: scratchy fabric, bunchy skirt, teeny bodice. it feels like you are wearing wrapping paper--the foil kind.",0
"I tried these on in store and purchased them in the chocolate brown as the fit was perfect! i am 5' 8"" and weigh 145 pounds with an approximate 10"" difference between hips and waist. the size 27 fit perfectly. i was surprised that they did not wrinkle terribly as they are linen. they withstood wear during a very active day and still looked great by evening. they wash well and only needed a quick touch up with the iron. i liked them so well that i ordered a second pair in grey!",1
"So wanted great pair of sweater leggings...great for running errands and keeping the outfit simple. these are not that. these fit very poorly...i ordered the small, which is more like a large one in the waistline...there is nothing to hold these up and i could fit two of me in them. unfortunately, i thought all would be fine and i discarded the receipt and have worn them a few times~",0
"I am so sad i have to return these leggings. they're adorable--so much so that my fiancã© commented favorably on them--but as other reviewers have pointed out, there's no elastic or string in the waistband so you have to walk around holding them up with one hand or they'll fall down! why, sleeping on snow? whyyyyyyyyyyy? they're so great otherwise!",0
"This would have been a perfect jacket for a trip i'm taking, light weight and very stylish. however the jacket runs huge, the arms are long but it was the shoulders that were too big. i wear a size 8-10 mostly 10 in retailer clothes i ordered the large and the shoulder seam was about 2? past my natural shoulders. i won't return for a smaller size because the fabric being wool (i should have checked) its unbearably itchy esp around the neck, you could wear a long sleeve top and a scarf but then it",0

I know what you're thinking- the review below this says 'runs small.' not true. i am a size 4 fitted top and ordered a size small at first. it arrived and was really boxy and so big it wasn't flattering in any way. i ordered the xsmall because i really wanted this top to work. the fabric quality is amazing. so soft and strong! the xsmall is definitely a better fit but the cut is still a little boxy by nature. it's an excellent high quality chambray shirt if you're in the market!,1
I love this unique shirt!  the only thing is is is really wide like a babydoll top fit.  i tucked mine into skinny jeans,1
"I ordered the xx petite on this one, and unlike last year's version of a similar sweater, this one is a bit longer and looser. last year, i kept the xs p, but it was shorter too. the fit is loose, not snug or form-fitting, even as the smallest size available, it was loose but not large or unflattering. the length was also appropriate. love the colors, and pattern too. the material is soft, and the button detail in the back is fun. i am 30dd, 26.5 in waist, 115 lbs, for reference.",1
"Love the design with the buttons down the back but unfortunately this did not work for me. the colors were brighter than shown on the website which was my first disappointment, i prefer more muted colors. the second disappointment was the material. for me it was just too itchy. unfortunately, this one's going back.",0
Love everything about this sweater. i usually wear xs in most retailer tops but had to exchange for a s. hope this helps!,1
This shirt looks nothing like the fit in the pictures. it is short and very wide. i had read the previous reviews and thought i could take it in on the sides some but it is literally the shape of a trapezoid.,0
"I bought this shirt immediately because of the pattern, when it arrived i was super confused. it's not a tee shirt like it looks like in the photos. it's made with cotton fabric with a tiny bit of stretch. i ordered the xl because i have brought shoulders and 36e bras size and it fits like a 2x or larger. i would say order two sizes down. also it hangs like a maternity shirt. i might order it once it's on sale, which it definitely will be, but even then am not positive i would keep it.",0
"This blouse is a disappointment! it runs so large, it looks ridiculous. the cute is super wide and flared. they must have it pinned on the model. it is not flattering at all. i really thought this could be cute. not worth the money either! it's expensive and ill-fitting. for reference i am 5'3 and 123lbs and wear a 2 or 4.",0
"The top looks like an oversized shirt in the model photo but as you can see it's not at all in person. made with what feels like hospital scrubs-meets-crisp-poplin, this shirt is stiff and does not lay flat against the body. the cut is almost triangular or bell shaped causing it to jut out - think of a flared wide leg pant - but as a shirt. the sleeves have a similar cut as well. i, too, am a 34c and found it made me look much wider as your bust will cause the shirt to move away from you. it's s",0
"I thought the design of this dress was distinctive, and it did not let me down. there is no zip so if your chesty like i am it may be a little difficult to get on, but i wouldn't sizes up because then it would be too big and balloony. i'm 5'5' and i got the petite which hit me about 2 inches above my knee. material is like jeans and consequently not see-through at all. even though it is quite expensive, there is something special about the dress.",1
"Great top, for me it would be tuck in only as a little wide near waistline. i am 5'4 so can do it with top length, but not sure someone taller could. so depends on wardrobe needs what you plan on wearing it with. would probably look cute with skinny jeans, but i bought it for skirts. adorable detailing around neckline and sleeves. really love it, but more sheer than i expected. great with a nude bra, but probably would see other colors through it.",1
"Super soft and cute. the buttons add a nice touch. the color depicted online gave me pause, but when i saw it in the store it was more of a blue than that what you see in pic. great investment. beautiful sweater. 34c, 65"", 135 and the small is perfect.",1
"This is completely see-through and i think it would look awkward with a cami underneath because of the highly structured shape. fairly cute fit, but not as a layering piece.",0
"Sadly, this has to go back. i am 5'5"", 128 lbs and this shirt is super short on me. very short. and it's so wide it's almost a trapeze cut. the overall effect is 50s/60s style maternity shirt. which is disappointing because the fabric is beautiful, the detail is nice in person, even the sleeve cuffs are great. i am not very tall and i'm fairly thin on top so i can get away with a lot of styles, loose and tight. the combo of short and trapeze is just unflattering.",0
Loved this top! it's an a-line shape which is very flattering. thick enough for winter with a coat but light enough for spring still.,1
I'm normally a 12/14 and ordered my normal size 32 which fit perfect. i purchased both the red and beige. the quality fit and color are great. i'm 5'9 and the regular length was fine.,1
It broke my heart to return this shirt. the pattern is just the kind of quirky that i crave from retailer. the quality is really great but in the end this shirt was just way to big. i don't think the xs would have made enough of a difference. sad face.,0
"This is a beautiful sweater and a nice medium weight. however, it is an awkward length. i am tall and have a long torso so it's just not cut right for me and was not flattering.",0
"This sweater is super cute and i so wish it worked for me. i am but i must like sweaters a little longer than everyone else because this just hit me at the wrong place. if you're still trying to work off that last little bit of your baby bump, even 2 years removed, this hits right there and emphasizes your waist, at least on me and i'm 5'5"". it's so cute that i might have kept it to see if i could get it to work for me but it still has the ink tag on it so it has to be returned no matter what an",1
If i stopped eating for a couple of months or jumped into a time machine and set the dial for 1990 i would really enjoy this beautifully made delicate blouse. the problem area is evident looking at the photo --the tiny tight fitted gorgeous bodice. i will keep this piece becasue i love it so and the apocolypse is apparently imminent and i have hardly any food in the house.,1
"Just a warning. i am always a 6 or 8 and even the 8 was so tight in the waist i could barely out this on. if you don't have a super tiny upper waist, this won't fit well. too bad, because it's super cute, if a bit sheer.",0
"I tried this on in store after falling in love with it on the rack. the dress is beautifully designed and has elegant, subtle features. i am normally a 2-4 in retailer dresses, but the 0 was the closest fit on me. unfortunately, this dress fit very strangely. the waist on the dress was way above my actual waist, which was unusual given i have a very short torso. it also had a strange fold right around my belly button, which was very distracting. i'll put this all down to my extremely straight and",1
"This is such a great work wear piece for me. it's form flattering, well constructed, comfortable and truly elegant. this is probably my 5th or 6th dress from the moulinette soeurs line and i am consistently impressed with the quality and wearability of these clothes.

"I really wanted to like this dress. the color is perfect, the design and cut are cut (not always the case at retailer). however, the fabric quality was terrible - a shiny acrylic with cheap nylon lace. it looked like something from a discount store and had to go back.",0
"I cannot say how much i love this dress. i purchased it in mid-november and i'm wearing it for the 4th time this evening, which prompted me to write a review. it fits tts. the stomach area is slightly unforgiving, but due to the dark color, it's not at all a deal breaker. plus, it's a great dress to wear with opaque tights, which solve the tummy issues as well. what i love most about this dress is its ability to go from day to night/less formal to more formal. it looks great with edgy black ankl",1
"So, when i first found this dress it was already on sale and sold out in petites. for reference i am 5'2"" and currently weighing in at about 108, and my bust is a 32d. the store near my work has a petite shop (thank goodness) so i headed there after my day. they didn't have it in my size but they did have the regular sizing in a 0, which i promptly purchased.

the crossed part sits a little higher than my natural waist, but i think for someone with a slightly smaller chest it would hit spot on.",1
"Comfortable shorts. thinner fabric. pattern disguises underwear lines. love the exterior pockets, as i won't have to tuck them in when i zip up. as the previous reviewer said, the black and white pattern has blue accents. they're mid-rise and a longer length, which i appreciate.",1
"These shipped fast!!! the fit is good. these shorts have some stretch to them, which is nice. there is a green/blue color in the fine detail making them versatile with a few different colors of tops. true to size. the length is perfect for my taste. i am 5'7"".",1
"If i saw this online i would never have glanced at the picture twice. instead, i came across it at the store and immediately snatched it up to try on. the green is very spring-y and rich while the raised little dots give it a lovely texture overall. really adorable on and fits fine in the regular although i am usually petite.",1
"I thought this was so cute online, sweet and feminine, but when it arrived and i tried it on in my usual 12p i felt like i had just stepped back into freshman year of highschool - it is very early 90s - not the bohemian i was going for. it is also very high waisted, even for my little 5'1 frame. i truly felt like they pulled this out of someone's closet, dusted it off and said, ta da! as much as i love rachel and monica i have moved on from their clothing :)",0
I am in love with this top. i was a little nervous because i'm on the bustier side (34d/dd) but it works for me so i say give it a shot--you never know. i'm hoping for more tops like this in the fall line.,1
"I love vintage lace so i was very excited to try on this dress. unfortunately, it just didn't work for me. i'm a larger, busty lady (size 14) and i tried on the xl. it fit fine, but did absolutely nothing for my figure. it just kind of hung on me. even with the belt tie i still feel like it didn't accentuate my waist line. i think this is better for someone with a straighter figure.",0
"Very fun shirt. is see through beyond lace so need to wear black tank or black bra. very comfy, flirty and feminine. tts. flowy fit like on model.",1
What a flattering top! great with jeans or shorts. i'm a sz12 and l was perfect for me. love the colors - got lots of comments.,1
Finally saw this dress online. i have to say that it looks better in person. the model might be too tall for this dress. i am 5'4''. it's right to my ankle. the color is in a nice off white. the material is a good quality. the overall cut is nice. it's a kind of classic feeling.you could wear it for a long time without going out of style.,1
This top has nice quality lace but the layout is strange! it wouldn't stay under my boobs but kept creeping up and looked strange! not for girls with a chest!,0
"This is a gorgeous blouse. the quality is on point. i was so disappointed because i had to return it.
the blouse was just a few inches too tight across the bust.",1
"What a huge disappointment! i was really looking forward to wearing this top but it is very tight and awkward around the bust. if you have any semblance of a chest, this is not for you! i am a 38c and this was a no go. the quality of the top seems to be top notch but the fit was just no. it felt restrictive and it was hard to even move my arms and i have slender arms.",0
"Retailer has incredible service, and so they let me return this dress even after having worn it. however, this dress cannot be cleaned. i saw a stain on it after the first use, so i first tried hand washing it. however, the black part of the dress came off on the white part, making the stain worse. i then tried dry cleaning it (the care tag allows both) and that produced 3 or 4 new stains where the black rubbed off on the white. it's a beautiful, striking dress (that would be great maternit",0
"Get this while you can. it will not last to hit the sales. it is a beautiful top, with very unique colors and pattern-reminds me of key west. it has a slight tent shape at the bottom, which is not how it appears to be, but the cut is very nice and well done. i wouldn't size down, as the armholes are not huge, and then it would be too tight. i will have to cut them about 1/2"" to not bug me, and i'm typically a med, which is the size i got. i could take the sides in about 1"" on each side, which is",1
"I bought a petite medium and the length was right, but it fit like a potato sack. it was quite comfortable, and didn't look completely terrible from the front, but from the side, it was terribly unflattering. when i tried it on my boyfriend saw it and said it looked like i was wearing a nightie. i don't do form-fitting clothing, but this was the exact opposite and flared out every which way. it's got to go back.",0
"I have never written a review before, and i love retailer and shop here often. however, i am so unhappy with this shirt i wanted to share to save someone else money. it is such poor quality, it looks thick and flows in the photo, it is very thin and it itches so bad, i could hardly even stand to try it on when it came in the mail. i will deff be taking it back, and do not recommend it at all.",0
"The top falls nicely, great quality, the lace is beautiful. however, the sleeves are too wide and puffy. the top is voluminous and i wished it had more form fitting sleeves to balance this out. the top does not look flattering on me so i will be returning it.",0
"The fabric is very comfortable and soft.
love it - great fit.(tts)
would recommend",1
"Classic dress with a twist with split colors. very comfortable without looking like a bag on. can be dressed up or down. i am 5'7"" 118 and bought th extra small. perfect fit for me. not form fitting but still has shape and style.",1
"I fell in love with this dress from the moment i saw it on various mother's day weekend insta posts by retailer stores. i was worried that it would not be a great cut for me, as it's pretty straight up and down, and i wasn't sure the waist would hit at the right place, because i'm super high waisted and this didn't appear to be so. in truth, it isn't, and i'll be tying the ribbon (or wearing a slim belt) at a higher point than where was originally intended. however, what struck me was the ability",1
"This is a cute dress, not real form fitting and made of a thin but comfortable jersey material. little see thru and kind of sexy though if you have cute lingerie.",1
"I bought this top for my daughter. the colors are so vibrant and the design and feel of the top is flattering. this top can be worn with black pants for a night out with friends, or with jeans or shorts to hang out at the beach! my daughter loves it!",1
"I love this off the shoulder top. it is so flattering  and the  colors are gorgeous. i normally wear a small or medium in retailer tops, i am wearing an extra small in this one, and it fits great. i am only 5 1"" tall so the length hits me perfectly.",1
"I was not sure about ordering this dress, but i'm glad i did! i love the cut and all the details...very unique! i am usually a 10 and the medium fits me perfectly. love, love! if you're on the fence about ordering this dress, i say go for it. for reference, i'm 5' 6"" and the hem hits me mid-calf.",1
This dress looks very good on me! it's a cute way to appear dressy without the extra work to look the part.,1
"Unfortunately, i will need to exchange for a bigger size. i am 5""3"", 115 pounds. i normally wear a 2 or a 4. i ordered a 4 and they are a bit too tight. i am worried the 6 will be to big but love the pants enough to give that a try. excellent quality.",1
"Very flattering fit. a little billowy but i'm okay with that because it hides my stomach. have to wear a camisole underneath as you can see through the lacey parts. overall i love the shirt design, fabric and fit.",1
"I love this dress so much, very detailed and comfortable. looks great with the pilcro vest.",1
"I tied this on a whim, thinking it was a big 80s on the hanger, but it is so cute and hip, i fell instantly in love. the material is amazingly soft and generally doesn't wrinkle. i wore it for my thesis presentation and it went flawlessly! it has a very light light-grey window pane print on it that looks great with grey pixie pants, white pants, and the blue is light enough you could even pair it with black bottoms and jeans. a total catch, and the fun layover in the back is just an added pop of",1
Ditto to all of the reviews who state that this top is beautiful but runs small in the bust. i am a large or an xl so i ordered this in the xl. i'm a little broad and busty and it was too small/binding. this is a beautiful well made top for a certain body type.,0
"I had to return this blouse because it ended up been too small and super itchy. im kind of busty but medium usually works and this one was super tight across my chest. not comfortable at all and the fabric is kind of a sheer with the sparkly lines in silver.
wouldn't recommend it.",0
Not what i expected. they ran very small and the fabric seemed cheap for the price. returned.,0
The material is so thin and so itchy..like other reviewers stated..it itches so bad and feels like sandpaper..i thought it would be ok to wear a tank top underneath but sleeves are still itchy. otherwise the design is great and the long peplum hem is very pretty and would look great with skinny pants or leggings and boots,0
"I paired this beauty with the beacheress necklace and the result was stunning. the colorway in this top just makes my summer tan pop! i am 5'3""/36b/108 lbs and the xs fit perfectly. since it does run short there is no way that i would suggest anyone go with a petite unless they are under 5' and/or very short waisted! the fabric in the top drapes beautifully and i felt super feminine all evening...and got tons of compliments as well!",1
"I wish i could keep this dress based on the pretty orange print and style but the fabric and details make this a return, even on sale price :( agree with previous reviews: bodice too tight, neckline too high/chokes, fabric is rough, outer is poorly attached to liner so it poofs in weird areas. too bad...so sad!",0
"Way too much fabric; sticks out like jodhpurs but from the hip - eek! might be a great dress in rayon or a drapey fabric, but the extra fabric just piles up on itself... the outer layer also doesn't feel like it will breath. add the cotton lining, and i think it will feel miserable in the heat of the texas summer. returning.",0
This shirt is such a pretty color i was so excited to get it... however i felt like the fit was not flattering. it sort of just hung on me. didn't do much for me. i actually ended up returning it.,1
"The girls at the local retailer are big fans of coh, & i've been thinking maybe i shld try them out. i ordered these online in the size 29, as i am usually a 28/29 in skinnys. i am a little hard to please, or say hard to fit in skinny jeans. i like a snug good looking skinny but not so much if it's uncomfortable. paying full price it is expected for the look & fit to be perfect. even if on sale, i won't go it if i think something is not right for me. at 5'3"", 117#, slender legs, skinnys are either",1
"A very cute and comfy top that's lightweight and falls nicely... but, it does snag very easily. so far, i've worn this top once and found small snags in multiple areas. the snags might blend into the fabric texture if they did not create dark spots. the yarn/thread is a mixture of a celadon tone and black, which concentrates the black when snagged.",0
"I am of average height, but these pants are so long!! i considered altering them because i like the print, but i don't think it's worth the effort for workout attire so they're going back. shame!!",0
I bought these shorts last week in the cobalt blue color. they are super comfy and the color is beautiful however after wearing them for only a few hours i noticed a pull in the fabric that all the way down the front of the right leg. i'm extremely upset about this because they were relatively expensive for lounge shorts. i love the shorts otherwise.,0
"Not up to retailer standards! fabric quite thin(you could see nude-color bra through the white one) and thin fabric, wide bottom hung sloppy; no way i would feel ""well dressed"" in this top. i returned it.",0
"I purchased this top during the 20% off sale and i'm very pleased with it. i love how flowy it is without looking like a maternity top. for reference, i'm 5'4, 130# and purchased a small (my usual retailer size). if you have broad shoulders you may have to size up as i found the arms and shoulders to run a little small.",1
"I am not in love with this top and will be returning it. from the front it looks like a basic tee (which i expected) but the back ""x"" is too loose and slumps to the side so that it doesn't look like an ""x"" as the picture shows. so basically the focal point of the tee falls short.",0
"I tried on the xs in store (would need xxs i think, it is short enough to not need petite). anyway, the neck part was really bunching up on me (between neck and girls), it wasn't flattering. the rest of the tank is really pretty and flattering though, but the bunching was enough for me to leave it behind. the fabric is soft, and the color is nice warm neutral. i love the lace back with the subtle layer of satiny looking fabric. overall goo, perhaps i don't have the right shoulder shape fr this.",1
"The white is completely sheer. i am so tired of see through shirts!! even at the sale on top of sale prices, i wouldn't recommend this shirt. if the fabric weren't sheer it would be a very comfy shirt with a cute back. but it just looks silly with a tank top under it, the cotton just doesn't lay right.",0
"I tried on this top in the ivory color in the store, but i didn't need another ivory-colored top, so i passed it up. however, i kept thinking about the pretty details, especially trim on the sleeves, so when i saw it online in the red color, i ordered it. i was surprised when it arrived with how thin and sheer the fabric is (the soft flowy mini-pleated body of the shirt; the other sections are flat cotton, which is more sturdy). i hadn't noticed this when i tried on the ivory version! but i'm ke",1
"I ordered this dress online. the previous reviews were accurate that it runs small, particularly in the waist. i normally wear a 0 or 2, but i ordered the 4. it fit my waist and hips but was slightly loose at the top even though i am a 34c. i liked the look, but it had a hole where the seams had come apart between the black stripe across the chest and the main fabric. additionally, the black squares were pulled in several places with threads sticking out. i returned it immediately.",0
This dress looks amazing on. it fits your body like a glove and the zipper lies flat. the black out-lined neckline looks very sophisticated as does the pattern of the dress. my only issue is that the dress ran very small.,1
"I thought this top would be a little more form fitting than it is. there is so much extra fabric near the bottom it is almost like a swing style top. the fabric will most definitely snag, as it is not a linen or cotton top material but rather a silky type and also very thin - not very good quality. i got the smallest size possible and it was absolutely huge, everywhere but the neck.",0
I loved the style and shape of the dress . it does run small. i had to return it because some of the black dots pulled and looked like it might be more of a problem as i wore it,0
"These are lovely, dressy pants, but they act larger than they need to (even for the model above, see photos). i usually order size 8-10 in pants, and size 10 in these fit at the waist but felt bulky below, partly because of large pockets made of the same material. another detail to note: there is metallic thread running thru out the material, glinting more than the photos show. the golden vertical leaflets don't show as much, because of the overall shine. so i will return these lovelies, because",1

This suit is absolutely gorgeous but it really will only fit a very short waisted gal. it fit perfectly in the body and in the bust but just was not long enough for me to lift my arms up and my size c cup boobs to not pop out. i was very sad to return it :( i am a size 8 with c cup boobs and ordered it in a medium,0
"I loved the rich navy blue color with the accent pockets. the fabric was a nice weight, not too thin like lots of retailer tops. i liked the top from the front, however the back was way too long, especially with the looseness of the style. it would have been much better if it were not so much longer in the back and maybe a little more fitted. it might work on someone taller. i'm 5'3"" and 120 lbs. and i tried xs.",0
"I absolutely loved these pants the first several times i wore them. the fit is flattering, they are a perfect long length, and the colors are stunning. after several wears, it was time to wash them and i followed the directions provided to wash with cold water and line dry. i was initially horrified with the amount that these pants shrunk in fit and length and the colors ran together. after a lengthy ironing session, i was able to smooth out the material and restore much of the length and fit bu",0
"I agree with the other reviewer who stated this sweater is very ""80's""!! online it looks minorly fluffy with muted colors, but in person it's a bad overly-fuzzy christmas sweater with super bright 80's colors!! if you're going for kitschy / tacky / retro this may work for you, but if you are looking for the sweater in the photo you'll be disappointed... :( it looked to be true to size, but to be honest i hated it so much i didn't even try it on.",0
"I love these pants - the color is great, the style is comfortable and easy but can be dressed up. like other reviewers, i washed these according to the care instructions and they shrunk horribly. however - after some googling, i was able to find a fix. soak the pants for 5-10 minutes in warm water mixed with 3-4 tsp hair conditioner. gently wring them out and start to (gently) stretch the fabric as much as possible. hang on a drying rack and continue to gently stretch the fabric as the pants dry",1
Love these jeans.,1
"I really wanted to like this top. in fact, i have put it on to wear several times then opted for something else. so i'm thinking it has to go back. for one thing, the yoke part is sewn onto the bottom so the stripes are crooked...that bothers me. i may get it in the white instead because i do like the style. i just wish it were in a solid color. but try it - it might work for you!",0
"These pants fit tts and are ask pictured in length on me (5'5""). i can go between a 4 and a 6, and tried the 6 and they were fine. that said, the fabric completed turned me off. it is that sort of stretch fabric with a sheen to it. i did not find them to be the wonderful wardrobe basic i thought they'd be- the fabric is just too stiff, and the sheen made them feel cheap, unfortunately.",0
"Love this suit. i ordered up a size on the bottoms, and am so glad i did. the style fits true to size, is beautiful, and vibrant. i thought it looked like ribbing vertically, but it is just part of the design. it is not padded at all, but is thick enough to be seamless.",1
"Tried one at the store. love the look and feel of this pants. so soft and flowy! sizing runs large. for reference, i'm 5'4"" and 115 lbs. xxsp fits just right. highly recommended!",1
"I purchased these pants while on vacation because i thought they'd be the perfect addition to my comfy travel wardrobe. on my second wear, i happened to be on a long-haul flight when the entire side seam split about a food long on my upper, outer thigh. luckily i'd packed a back-up dress. the pants weren't tight at all, but the seams wren't strong enough to handle a little pressure from sitting i guess. poor construction. i would not recommend these.",0
"Within 2 washings the color faded to a not so black black, like a pair of pants that has been washed over a year's use. after 5 or so washes the hook and eye closure began to fall off. the pants fit well, albeit a bit short (i'm 5'9"") and they run small. i sized up to a 6, when i usually am between a 2 or 4. i let the hem out, sewed the hook and eye closure back on and redyed them, and now they are good to go, but for nearly $90 i don't expect to have to do this much work. these are not my first",0
"For some reason, the cream colored cords are sheer. the material is quite thin. you can see the pockets through them, as well as the seams. i have other ag cords and it seems the material they are using this go around is substandard. too bad.",0
I purchased these in large which is normally my size on bottom. they are a little roomy and the waist is so high on me that i am going to tack the waist down. they are ok. good quality but not the best pants in the world.,1
"I loved these when i first got them. they fit perfectly and are the softest and most comfortable pair of cords i've ever owned. plus ag is the only brand of jeans i buy. unfortunately, they stretch out horribly within one wearing. for such a pricey pair of cords, i'm extremely disappointed. i'm not sure if i should've sized down, but now i'm wishing i had, although i'm not sure that would make a difference.",0
"I loved these pants. the fit well and were flattering. unfortunately after three wears, they came apart at the seam. very disappointing and frustrating.",0
"These ran true to size, but the fabric is very stiff and unforgiving. i'm athletic and have lean legs, but these seemed to cling to and roll on every dimple on my thigh. and sitting down was uncomfortable at the knees because of the stiff fabric. i loved how they fit at the waist, but the legs just didn't work for me. sadly returning these.",0

"I like these pants a lot. got one pair in black
and one pair in holly. the green holly are just a perfect green, so nice for the season. they are very comfy and feel right all day without any sagging.
i highly recommend and would buy more if they weren't on the pricier side.
oh and great for causal but also dresses up nicely with some heels and a silk blouse",1
I had high hopes for this top but once again it is just a big boxy too much material top. i get the style but if it adds 10lbs to your middle area its not for me. it is a thin material so it does hang nice.,0
"Purchased these pants that i had quickly tried on. when i got home, i re-tried them and felt they were too snug and the material had an odd feel and did not lay right. i took them back and tried them in the next size. they fit much better but the material did not lay well on me. i think that they are a bit too stretchy and ended up not buying the larger ones either. i would definitely recommend trying these in a store rather then ordering online.",0
I'm 5 ft 7 125 lbs true size 4 and these pants made me look like i had boy parts. super disappointed!,0
"I purchased the grey cords on sale. they are super soft and stretchy- the do run large, so you may want to size down. otherwise, nice fabric and cut.",1
"Just bought this and am in love with it. it's a really nice weight - light for spring. the drape-y fit is very flattering. it's longer in the back than in the front and has a nice swing to it. can't wait to wear it!

i tried on the tee in the lighter color and didn't care for it much - i liked the contrast of the black and silver stripes.",1
"Love the cut on these cords as well as the fabric. it's a somewhat thin corduroy with a nice little stretch which makes them very comfortable and very flattering. they are true to size. i got the grey which is a pretty, light grey without the heavy blue undertone you often get in grey fabric.

great cords!",1
"I just bought these in store. so great looking. however, i bought the petites and they are still incredibly long. like 6 inches too long. so, i'll hem them, though based on the review that mentions shrinking, i might wash them first to see what happens. great for summer in the city.",1
"I own the essential slims and love them, so i figured i could order these in my normal size and they'd fit great. i was way off. they were uncomfortably tight in the calves (which is understandable - i'm a runner so my calves are disproportionately large) and uncomfortable in the waist. i decided to order one size bigger and pretty much had the same problem in the calves. the high waist was also still unflattering and uncomfortable. these might be great for hour glass shape with skinny calves. t",0
"These pants are a great addition to my work wardrobe. i needed to size up more so for my legs vs my waist, but nothing a little tailoring won't fix.",1
Cute fit but... split in the thigh after two weeks. and i'm not a big gal. poor quality.,0
"So sad becuase i like the design. i would not recomend the lack to anyone that does not live and work and shop in a completely immaculate environment. i wore this to work the day after purchasing and within three hours i honestly looked like i had slept in this sweater for three monthe straight. i had to take the sweater off and work in a t-shirt. 
the marigold color may be better than the black abut showing lint but something intrinsic to the fabric really attracts lint like nothing i have eve",0
"This print is beautiful and the design is unique and great for work. my only complaint is that it runs huge and the torso fit is extremely boxy. i'm normally in between a size xs and s at retailer, bought the xs in this shirt and it still almost too big.",1
"It is very comfortable and the fabric is amazing. it runs a little short on me because i have a long torso, but it works great with a tank underneath. love it!",1
I love these pants so much i had to write a review! purchased the carbon color recently in regular length - the length stated is pretty true and there was minimal shrinkage for me. size was also tts (typically wear size 2 and got 26). i've been wearing them often! they look great right out of the dryer and drape nicely. i've been purchasing the pilcro linen trousers for years but these are my favorites this season --- i also think the quality is much better. i will be getting them in more colors,1
"Run large and leg is very wide. even sizing down, they seemed too floppy.",0
"Ugh, i hate that this didn't work! the top shoulder/sleeve portion is so pretty and unique, but the fabric is overall this and cheap feeling, the length is too short for how flowy the shirt is (the sides go way up on me). the fabric feels like something that would fall apart after one wash. back it goes!",0
I got the black in an xs and it fits wells. its a bit warmer than i expected. i love the design of this sweater! perfect with leggings.,1
"This shirt is so cute alone with jeans or dressed up with nice jewelry, a scarf or cardi. its just the right weight, true to size, drapes nicely and its very flattering. i""m sorry i didn't order more when i had the chance. its already sold out in the colors and sizes i wanted. excellent quality as usual -- thanks again retailer!",1
"I went back and forth about buying this jumpsuit. very glad that i decided to make the purchase. i wore the jumpsuit to a holiday party and look forward to pairing it with a blazer for work. the material is very soft, yet durable. i wore with flats, but it would be cute with a colorful pair of heels.",1
"It takes perfection for me to pay this much for a pair of pants, and these delivered! i bought these pants love-at-first-sight in the carbon color. i have not washed them yet, so i can't comment on durability, but they fit like a dream. i carry extra weight in my thighs and rear, and these pants are very flattering and slimming, and don't pull and crease in the crotch area like so many other pants do on my body. my usual size fit perfectly, and the length is great on my 5'5"" frame. i can almost",1
"I ordered this shirt online without seeing it in person, and it is great! it is true to size (if not slightly loose fitting) and a thick cottony-material with a pretty design. could be nice for spring, summer, or even fall with a cardigan.",1

"I believe that this sweater is by moth and not knitted and knotted as noted in the description. for me, this tunic was just ok. i didn't think that the quality was great and it just didn't wow me, especially at this price point.",0
"The pics online for this dress are horrible in comparison how stunning this dress is in person.
just received it and far exceeded my wildest expectations!
it is elegant, classy, and an understated sexy!
the colors are rich and vibrant.......gorgeous shades of plum and blue....a unique color combination that is gorgeous!
the open mess dress with the solid under layer is a wow!
beautiful and flattering fit.
it is a 10 !!!!
i ordered my usual size and i would say it is true to size, but slig",1
I agree with the other reviewer the concept of this is fantastic. but sadly did not work for me. first of all it runs so small i normally wear a 6/8 and ordered a 10 and i still had a hard time closing over my 34ddd chest. but i am abnormal. anyways the peplum i wish was a little more subdued like in the photo. maybe its because im so curvy but it just didn't work for me. sadly its going back.,1
"I happened to see someone purchasing this top in the green at my local retailer store, and the sales associate told me they had just gotten then in and they were already almost gone. they only had one left, in size s. it fit, but was a bit too long for me so they ordered the sp for me. it's perfect! the color says turquoise, but it's actually more of an emerald green. it's a bright saturated color, much more beautiful than the online photo. i have green eyes and love the way it brings them out. it",1
"I loved the style of this shirt so much that i bought two of them. unfortunately after washing the turquoise one, it sprang several holes. the same thing happened to the second one after one wash! i purchased several of these shirts in the tank style over this past summer, and they have washed and worn great. i think the fabric quality and craftsmanship has gone way downhill at retailer lately. very disappointed.",0
"I thought this top was purely elegant. i'm 5'4"", and 135 lbs. i ordered a small and it fits perfectly. i thought the fabric was soft, but somewhat sheer on the top. it goes great with just about any pant.",1
Love this top! i get compliments on it every time i put it on! it dresses up a pair of jeans perfectly!,1
"I ordered this top in a 14, my usual size, and it fits fine, but it is way too short-waisted! it looks nothing like what the model is wearing. her top comes low on her waist, almost to her crotch area. mine was just about 2 inches below my belly button! it was almost as if they accidentally cut off the lower half of the top at the factory! very strange.",0
"I purchased this top in the purple. it is much prettier in person then in the picture. the color is rich and vibrant. i am usually a large or xl but only needed the large in this top. 
the combination of fabrics is what makes this top special and the sheer bell sleeve really sets it off. 
i felt that it flowed perfectly, not as full as some of the fall retailer tops. (which are too full for me.)
i am around 5'6"" and a little on the broad side, so perhaps on someone smaller it might be overbeari",1
"I wanted to love this top. i wanted to love it so badly i bought it twice. the design and beading are beautiful, but the sizing is off. as another person mentioned it does run short, but that was not the issue for me. i ordered my usual size in this brand and the arm holes were too tight. because i really love it, i decided to exchange it for a larger size. i did not try it on in the store because i never wear that size, and just assumed the arm holes would be larger. sadly they were not. still",0
"This top may be right for some, but it did not work for me. i've been looking for a nice black top and loved the flutter sleeves on this one. however, it didn't do much to flatter my body. i ordered the xl, but it was huge. i'm not sure a l would have solved my problems if it had been available. i found it looked boxy and and agree that the arm holes are too big. 

the quality is great and style so pretty, though. i wish it had worked for me!",0
"I really wanted to love this, but it was just too voluminous to be flattering. i am typically a size 10 or 12 in dresses and jumpsuits, and the medium was billowing around me. also,the elastic waist hit me low and bunched in an unflattering way. it had to go back.",0
"I was debating getting a large in this top but went for the medium, boy is it huge, the jersey fabric is quite thick which makes the sleeves bulky and uncomfortable, even the small would be giant! 
for reference i normally wear a size 8/10 my chest is 34 e and this was just so so huge, it hung so badly of my chest that it looked frumpy and made me look bigger than i am.
the colours are true and nice and vibrant... definitely size down with this one",0
"I bought a size small (5'6"" & 130lbs). it was baggy everywhere so i added a belt similar to the model and it did help some but the pockets stuck out too much. i ended up looking ""hippy"" with no butt. the material is nice and it is a nice quality. i just didn't have enough to fill it out anywhere and i felt if i got a xs it would have been too short in the crotch area.",1
This top is gorgeous and i exchanged it 3 times hoping it would work. i originally got the size a would normally wear (a 6).and the arm holes and top were extremely tight and the top was short so i sized up and still had the same problem. i then went all the way up to a size 14 in order to get the length of the shirt log enough but now it is quite large around my hips. i love the detailing of the shirt but unfortunately if you have any chest at all it will not fit,0
"I found both colors and jumped on this shirt. then i got it home and realized that it was pretty much useless. there is no way to put a sweater or jacket over it, it is too hot to wear in the summer, putting a tee under ruins the look.
i am very flat chested so it hung well, but there is lots of shirt. both went back in exchange for two wearable items.",0
"I love cotton fabric, so i was very excited to find this shirt in gorgeous fall colors. i have the dark red/burnt orange color, and it is pretty. but i have worn the thing once, and today when i put it on again, i found 2 holes on the front of the shirt. so disappointed.",0
"Absolutely beautiful top, worn once...hand washed and that's all she wrote..ruined!! the black trim bled all over the top!! i tried everything you could imagine to get this back to normal! do not recommend!! :(",0
"This is huge. i thought it would be oversize but with a bit of shape. there is no shape to this and is a lot of material. i ordered an xs and typically wear an xs or s in blouses, sometimes medium in sweaters.
it seamed like 2 sizes too big. the material is very soft and the collar is nice. there is a ribbon tie at the waist. the tie is wimpy and could be nicer. when tied, there is so much fabric the is gathers and looks like i have no waist.",0
"I have been looking for an off-white vest and thought this one would be perfect, except it is going back. i am 5'9"" 150 lbs. medium is my normal top size, but this medium was tight even though the design looks relaxed in the picture. no buttons, so no way to close it. unlined and the design and fabric look more casual than the photo. not worth the price.",0
"Love the fit of the jeans just wish there was a couple more inches at the bottom:) these jeans have a 23 inch inseam not 26, so they hit at a very odd place on my calf- return. for reference i'm 5'8,",0
"I tried on an xs and it was boxy/roomy in the torso and the pocket on the wrist/forearm area made my arm look too bulky when i rolled the sleeves up like the model pictured. i love the idea of a relaxed fit cropped leather jacket in a versatile taupe color but when i tried this one on in person, it took me back to my childhood. i used to help my dad wash his cars when i was a kid and he used a leather chamois (""shammy"" for short) that was awesome for soaking up water. and that's what it felt lik",0

"This knit shirt is too thin, as most knit shirts i find are. i got this in the white, and was excited to try it on due to the fitted cut and cap sleeves. the upper part was great but the waist was too large for me, and was actually too long. had to return, especially for the cost. i purchased the xxs , which normally fits me.",0
"The suit is beautiful, however the white it is slightly see-through on the bottom front. even though it is slight, to me that is inappropriate...so i returned it. regarding sizing, i ordered a medium, i usually wear a size 6 (135lbs) and my body is evenly proportioned throughout. the medium was not tight at all but the back bottom region seemed cut just slightly less than ""full coverage"". i feel that i would be in-between sizes small and medium but did not try a small due to the slightly transpa",0
"I was so excited when i saw this dress! i love this color, and the poplin sleeves. i was so sad when i tried it on though, the back poofed out in such a weird and unflattering way. i think it is because there is a pleat high up in the back, but then it seems like it gets narrow again around the hips. strange. also the material is kind of stiff and seems poor quality. i do love the way the top and the sleeves look on me though, so i am actually considering keeping it and just making it into a top",0
"This shirt is cute, nice cut, but i don't love it. best as a sleeping tank.",0
"Got the coral reef color in a size medium. for reference, i say i am 5' 4"" because its easier than explaining that i am really 5' 3 and 3/4"", 138-140 lbs., 36c bra. size-wise, i am all over the place. recently i lost weight and have been buying smalls and mediums and anywhere from an 8 to a 12 from retailer. i so wanted to love this suit and am still in love with the fabric and colors. everything in the medium fit except for the bra cups. i am not especially big but there was zero cup room.",0
"I would not wear this to bed - it's almost too pretty! i've been wearing this top under sweaters and shells as the weather is moving from winter to spring - i think it transitions the comfort of plaid into warmer weather perfectly! it dips a little low on me in the front (34b/c), so it's probably not for more professional settings. i like to wear it with a lacy bra-type top peeking out underneath.",1
Weird fit and the tie just add to the problems. i think i'd like this a lot more if it were just an open cardigan without the tie. the tie seems like an after thought. it's flimsy and it just makes anyone wearing this look like a house -- no matter there size. i ordered a medium black and it's already in the mail!,0
"This top really is lovely. i had high hopes of it looking smashing with black jeans. i wash everything before i wear it. though this garment says it needs to be dry cleaned, there was nothing so delicate about the fabric that it had to be dry cleaned. so i hand washed it with delicate soap. when the lighter colors came into contact with the black, the black immediately stained the light color. i tried putting some stain remover on the black stains, rinsed and hung it above my bath tub. it is cur",0
This rich color is so flattering!  i also love that it has pockets and can be worn to dressy events or can be worn in more casual settings.  the side stripes give it a young and interesting touch.  the elastic waste makes it comfortable so i know i will get lots of use out of this.  i knocked off one star because of the price.  i plan on paring this with tan sandals and a dark denim blazer to start off with.,1
"I want to love this shirt, i really do, but it's huge! the top is tent-like, which would be adorable with skinny jeans, however the length of the back dips so low, the top kind of reminds me of pajamas. the color is beautiful, more like a light grey heather, and the white piping is like a shimmery ribbon material. overall, the top is cute, but it dips too low in the back and the bow weighs down the back of the shirt, so it makes it hard to adjust it in the front. sadly, it's a return.",0
"This dress is so soft, flowy and comfortable! the material is very smooth and silky. i'm hoping it holds up well over time with washing. i am 5""5, 120lbs and i ordered a xs. the elastic waist is a tad tight but otherwise it fits perfectly - just as shown on the model in terms of length and how the top fits. i said it runs a large because normally i would order a s but i think if i did, it would be too long and the arm holes might be too big.",1
"This jacket is pretty cute in person. it is a nice thick gauzy material. the black is more like a dark washed gray color. while i do like the jacket, i feel like it is cut a little wide... maybe i should have ordered a size down. i usually wear a combination of 6s and 8s and am usually between a small and medium. i ordered this in a medium, but there was quite a bit of extra fabric at the sides and in the shoulder area. i'm returning the jacket for now, but might reorder in a small another time.",1
"Comfortable and soft material, cute design and nice longer length..however, i'm long waisted and this looked ridiculous on my me, elastic came up right under my bra and not at my waist. would be cute for someone shorter.",0

"The dress had great potential, but the top sagged and made the dress look unflattering on me. unfortunately, i had to return it. the length was great, and the back and sides of the dress were nicely tailored and flattering. perhaps this would fit someone else better - i have a 34b/34c bust, and it didn't work for me.",0
"I didn't give this dress a second look for the longest time. when the summer tag sale came about, i decided to pop in and see if i could find a versatile summer dress. i was in need of a piece i could easily dress up or down. the burnt orange color variation caught my eye first, though i also tried on the neutral and it is also fabulous. this dress is amazing on! i am an hourglass shape, 5'8, size 6/8, 34 d chest, and i tried on both the small and medium. the small fit much better on me, and i r",1

Lovely dress and looks great on me but with just my second time wearing this dress and reaching across my desk to pick something up i feel the elastic waistband snap. this dress is definitely my size and i have felt no tightness or discomfort in the midsection. i have bought cheaper clothes with better elastic waistbands and had them for years. now i will spend the rest of my day looking like i'm wearing an orange sack. i'm not pleased.,0
There are darts that are not shown in this picture that make the dress ill fitted. not sure why they are not in the picture and on the dress. i wish the pictures shown were more accurate.,0
"This skirt is absolutely beautiful in person! the metallic thread is a subtle, stunning addition to this elegant piece. like the last person mentioned, it is thick, but i think it makes it look full rather than like a bag. i think the extra fabric/weight adds a more classic/traditional look to it, making it look more like a wool skirt from the 50s, 60s, or 70s. if you're not a fan of that look, you probably won't like the way this falls. like the description says, this is a piece that would neve",1
"This fabric and quality of the skirt are superb- there is a pretty metallic thread detail in the fabric that isn't easy to see online. however, the skirt is quite puffy, which i suppose could be good for someone with a boyish figure looking to add curves. but for many of us the extra puff might not be welcome. one would want to wear it with a tight fitting top and emphasize a small waist in order to counterbalance the volume of the skirt. could be a nice buy for the right person, just be aware o",1
I really wanted to love it but it was way too maternity on me. i love flowy but the flow on this dress hit me in all the wrong places. but i must say i have a 34ddd bust and wear a medium regularly. well i sized down and ordered a small and it just didn't work. it just flowed right off my chest to what looked like a dress concealing a baby bump. overall its cute just not for me.,0
"Admittedly, i ignored this dress on a few trips to my local retailer and then it went on sale, practically begging me to give it attention. i tried it on and fell in love! so feminine, light, and comfortable. 
it has a sort of roman/boho goddess vibe due to the billowy top, especially in the lighter greige with some sea-hued accessories added but not so much it feels like cosplay or something. i have a full bust (dd) and didn't find this dress to be unflattering. after wearing it to a party, i ac",1
A lot of reviewers have been saying that this dress is simply too busy to be wearable and they're right! i love the cut and fit of this dress but don't love the style. the awesome stylist at my retailer told me to take off the belt and then try it on with a ribbon ( like the one on the charisma sheath) and it was so much more cute. it completely changed the look of the dress and made it look more classy. the belt looks very cheap in person and a little hoochie mamma if you wear it with the dress i,1

"I love the style of this coat and the way it fits on the model. in reality, the cut is more straight. i was hoping for some darting and a slimmer silhouette. cinching the belt makes the coat bunch unattractively. if i sized down, i think it would look better but i'm concerned that my shoulders will not fit. the fabric is 60% poly/40% wool and a bit itchy where it's not lined. the lining is a jersey poly blend. the belt has flimsy ugly string loops that cheapens look of the coat. other than the b",1
"The dark orange is a beautiful color. this is a very comfortable dress, lightweight, long enough so you can sit down in it without any concerns. unfortunately, it's dry clean only, and you may want a belt to cover the elastic waist. the top part is very loose, so this might work better for full-figured gals.",1
"I liked this dress so much in the store - but didn't have it in my size - so had it shipped (and yes, paid shipping costs...) but it just didn't work on my body. the top is sort of poofy for lack of a better word - it made me look kind of poofy all over and really - i am not poofy!

"I usually follow the boho look, and this dress appealed to me immediately and it was in the color i wanted black. so excited to receive this as i knew i could wear it both as a dress and a tunic but that was not to be.

"I couldn't wait to get this dress from the online order. the fabric looked so interesting to me - linen, appliquã©, pockets, raw neckline. the dress looks sort of straight up and down on the model but in my opinion it's like a little a line tent. the top runs very narrow and i could barely get it over my head. i'm going to return it and try for a medium, for reference i am 5'4""  135 and usually wear a six or a small.",0
I loved this dress. the details in the embroidery are gorgeous and reminds me of another holding horses dress i own. what didn't work out is its a swing design but the fabric is thick and doesn't swing well. it's white and makes one look a bit heavier because of the generous cut. this could work on a tall person but on my short frame it didn't work.,0

"I tried this dress on in a 6 and a 4 (a 4 is a little small for me but it looked so loose and flowy i thought sizing down would be a good idea). the 4 fit in the outer layer, however as the previous poster mentioned, the lining is super tight. i couldn't even pull the 4 lining down over my hips. the 6 was far too big in the shoulders and arms and still too tight in the lining. not sure what when wrong here but it's a shame because it's a really cute dress.",0
"I'm sure there's someone out there who will look good in this but it certainly wasn't me. admittedly, i'm a less than ideal body type at a curvy 5' tall. still for a taller person this shirt runs short, for a curvy person this does nothing to accentuate a waist, for a short person this pattern is very busy even if the colors are beautiful, for a busty person the gathers around the chest make for a very frumpy look, and even for a short and thin person this shirt runs too big to get a good fit. c",0
I was so excited to get this dress and could tell right away it was beautiful. the fabric and detail are perfect and seem great for summer. then i tried it on ....to say the bust area is tight and not proportioned correctly would be putting it very nicely. it was a total joke. this dress is for very small chested only.,0
"The dress immediately caught my eye in the store. upon trying it on, i discovered that the slip runs extremely small (and unnecessarily so considering the looseness of the shift). the skirt is a tad long--i'm 5'6"" and it hits mid-knee. it's a shame the slip was so tight--i loved the dress otherwise.",0
"These colors!!!  my cup of tea!  i love everything about this top, from the fit, to the raw edge of the neck trim. it does seem like it will wrinkle easily but i can manage that for its sheer beauty!",1
Very nice polka-dot pattern. i so think it is versatile and can go with a lot of different colors. i am worn it was different colors underneath and both a skirt and jeans. it is a timeless classic!!,1
"This is a cute, fun addition to my wardrobe, especially since i am a polka dot fan! it is alittle short for me and i think it runs just a bit small, particularly if you want to wear like the model with longer shirt under it. overall, it was worth the sale price and will look good with casual pants, jeans and with dressier black pants for work.",1
"Super cute dress online on the model. what you can't tell from the picture is the slip underneath is not true to size of the dress and the outside layer of the dress is more sheer than the picture shows so you can tell the slip underneath is very tight. it might be my body type. otherwise, it's super cute in person and i wish it would've fit better!",0
"I love this dress. so simple yet beautiful. very excited to wear this spring and summer, perfect for easter.",1
"I really like this dress but after looking at the photo, it doesn't look like this, well at least on me. granted, i am 36dd so that might be part of the reason, but this dress is definitely trapeze style. i love the look but am cringing at the thought that someone is going to think i am pregnant. because of this, a belt is a must. plus it is the only way to achieve the look in the photos because it is a lot fuller in real life. 

another nice touch to this dress is that versatility with the ru",1
"I assumed at the price point this would be a high quality t-shirt/sweater. unfortunately, it is made of cheap looking material that is 50% acrylic and see-through.",0
So comfortable-so versatile-so perfect,1
"I absolutely love these pants! they are super comfortable, lightweight, have big pockets, and are so cute. can wear them anywhere- i'm taking mine to india next week!",1
"First, this vest is made by elevenses. i love this menswear inspired vest. it's simple and structured, however, it's long on my 5'2 frame. the price is also a little steep, but it will add a nice touch to a simple outfit. i plan on taking this to a tailor to take an inch or two off the bottom.",1
"I've been desperate for a swim cover that covers my arms & back. this one fits nicely--just a pretty, feminine, happy summer top that still lets me be leggy. i can't see them in the photos, but the embroidery detail at the upper part of this top has little mirrors sewn among the dots. very fun! i'm 5'5"" and when i paired this with jean shorts, everything below the crotch was visible--so perhaps slightly shorter than it appears in the pics.",1
"I was excited to see these on sale in the honey color i wanted. unfortunately, they were really more of a yellow than the golden color in the photo. also, they were so baggy in the rear that i looked silly, which was surprising since i don't have a small behind. unfortunately all the smaller sizes were sold out. had to send them back.",1
"Unique vest: modern, chic. i especially like the color block one the collar part. i know it will become a staple in my working clothes, and i can also see it blend in to my weekend clothes. i don't think the back of this vest is of bad quality, like another reviewer said. overall it's a hight-quality piece.",1
"While the fabric, embroidery and sizing are dead on, i just couldn't deal with the shiny little mirrors that the designer embellished this shirt with. that detail is not apparent in the photographs and i felt lessened the versatility of this blouse. so, it must go back to retailer.",0
"This is a beautiful vest. i love the color-blocking, the modern and structured style, and its versatility.  i bought it with a defective item discount because there were some stains. i promptly took it to the dry cleaners and was informed that the black would bleed onto the white paneling if they did a full wash. they spot-cleaned it, and it did bleed. although the tag says to dry clean this baby, the black dye will bleed to the white fabric. i'll be taking it back into the store today for a ref",0
I normally wear a medium in about everything and i bet an xs would've maybe fit me in this top. it's so billowy and not fitted at all.,0
"I tried this on at the store in black. the lace on the back is gorgeous and the fabric is very soft, but i would disagree with the previous reviews - i don't think this is flattering on all body types. i've got an hourglass figure and the top absolutely robs you of a waist. it drapes straight down on the front, so if you have a larger chest, you end up looking like a football player.

i think for a narrow frame or a smaller chest, this would be very flattering.",1
I love this tee! i bought the teal in store. rich colors. little details are perfect. the loose got was very flattering on me. i'm not busty at all and it hung so well. wore it to brunch and the flight home later!,1
"This top is perfect for a weekend casual look. you will love this, it fits true to size.",1
"I am 5'6"" and the neckline barely covers my bra -- would have to wear a cami with it. the fabric is soft, and the colors are very pretty. but the neckline is too low for me for a casual top.",0
"Looks like a pregnancy top. a lot gathers in front and back. added 10 pounds to me. not flattering on, much longer than on the model. and the color is not white. it's white with a weird tan/ taupe stripe.
i returned it same day i received it, which was disappointing.",0
This is a nicely made and comfortable sweater that is fun to wear. i have worn it with jeans and a t shirt and have received compliments on it.,1
"It's a very light material, so you can wear it early spring or early fall when it's still fairly warm. such a cute jacket, has no zipper or buttons though, so definitely more for style/look than for a crazy rainy day use! love it!",1
This top is very cute...on other people. i ordered my normal size (xs) and just did not work out. it's very billowy on the bottom (too much for me) and the top portion did not lay right. the material is thin so you will need to wear a cami underneath it. perhaps if i got the petite xs that right have been a better fit...not sure. in the end the top went back.,1
"Sizing is just getting unreasonable, and nothing fits unless it's a crew neck nowadays. this v-neckline would have been perfect if pictured as on the model, but on my 5' 4"" 115 lb frame, the xxs petite neckline came down so low my bra was exposed along the eyelet trim. additionally, the shirt looked like it shrunk in length, and wouldn't have covered a belt on my pants. it also did not match the product description and measured 22"" from the hps to hem. i'm unsure of how when pattern grading an i",0
"Well, i wanted to love it and it was just too much. i think it is a bit wider and weirdly baggier than it should be. i also feel it should be fully lined. it was not. the exterior wool and pattern is very nice. maybe if it was lined, a smaller size would have worked better, but for the price, i needed more. i also would have liked some sort of option for tightening the waist a bit when zipped up. i realize this isn't in the picture, so no expectation, but upon trying it on and seeing its boxines",0
"I have been looking for a cute raincoat forever. they are usually ""just a raincoat"". when this raincoat arrived - i was happy to finally have something that was fun to wear. only issue is a little tightness across the shoulder area - hoping this will just slightly stretch over time. the rest of the raincoat fit perfect and i wouldn't go up a size because of the shoulder issue. i purchased a light pink tie belt to use with it so i can keep the front closed when it is raining. it looks really cute",1
"First, i love moth clothing and own many, many of their pieces. this is very cute and i purchased it to go with the jules tank. the other reviewers are spot on with the cute factor and that it runs a little larger than the cropped sweaters. the snails are very cute, buttons run all the way down...
caveat: it began to pill after only a having it on a few hours - and i wasn't doing anything to cause extra friction- just sitting and lounging mostly. i noticed pilling on the inside of the arms when",0
This top is just adorable! so comfy and cute. i love the cut and how it goes a little longer in the back. i will be wearing this a lot!,1
"I have been having the worst trouble lately finding cute, comfortable cotton undies...until i found these. these fit like a charm, are incredibly soft, and don't ride up at all. (sizing in spot on.) plus they have the adorable lace trim that makes one feel nice and girly. last summer there was a nyt article saying that comforable underwear was coming back in style -- yay!!",1
"This is adorable! light and breezy. i felt it fit true to size leaning on the smaller size of a true fit. i am normally an xs/s and went with the small, fitting as it does on the model. it's a lightweight 100% cotton. not a lot of give. the v has a tendency to pull and probably will need a securing stitch. which was obvious when it arrived from another store. :(. i think wearing it with a cami is a great option considering it is flowy on the bottom and it is a thin cotton. overall great summer t",1
"Runs extremely large. i got an xs and am 5'4"" 115lbs and this would have fit someone who typically wears a size 10-14 and is 5'6"" and above. very disappointed with the size. the quality of the fabric wasn't great either. i wanted it to work so bad but just didn't!",0
"I do love sheath dresses and this one is very adorable!
true to size and nice length.
the black and white is kind of a throwback to the 60s flower power era and really cute.
nice weight so feels substantial not the flimsy wrinkly type material; more like a crepe.
very nice!",1
"Wow this is huge! i'm all for the tent-look with the right style, but this was absurd. i could have fit two of me into the width, and with the peplum style, extra width doesn't flatter anyone. the fabric is also so thin that it doesn't hang nicely, it kind of floats around the body. if you want a wide top, then this is perfect, but if you wanted something that hangs nicely, look elsewhere. i purchased a petite s, my typical size.",0
"I liked this top so much that i purchased it in two colors: green and wine. the top and colors are exactly as pictured online, the material feels great, and they fit nicely. the fit was true to size.",1
"This top is cute and comfortable. i did order a size larger than i would normally wear. i usually wear a size small but i had to buy a medium (5'7"", 145lbs, 34b).",1
"I ordered this top online in two colors, and kept the berry color. i liked it while trying it on. when i wore it an entire day, the top just didn't look that good. it wasn't flattering, and it focused on the bad areas despite being loose fitting. it didn't seem very flattering. i wore it for one day and am not happy with my purchase. i wish i could send it back but i already wore it. the fit just isn't very flattering. it is loose but focuses on the curves not in a good way if you are curvy.",0
"I just got this in the mail the other day. i was really excited and then crushed. one, buttons go all the way down and not what is in the photo. it takes it from hip whimsy to granny old lady sweater and then the minute i put it on it started pilling. it looked old and i wore it about 6 hours. i also used the roller lint remover on it and it pulled off one of the eyes on the snail. it is soft and felt comfy but look raggy and therefore it is going back. too bad but not what i bought and then not",0
"I ordered this dress in the black p8. i am 5' 3-1/2"", 140lbs, 34dd. i am average length in the torso area.. when i tried it on i wasn't able to button the button at my chest and the belt came slightly above my natural waist line. the length of the dress hit above mid thigh. way to short for my comfort level. it almost looked like a babydoll dress or a tunic to wear over jeans! the material is good quality and has a nice slip lining underneath. another nice thing is that it has a hook and eye clo",1
"This is one of the best potential dresses i've seen from retailer, but it needs a do-over. i'm usually a 12 in this style of dress, but i sized up to a 16 (the largest size) and couldn't even button the top. even if i had been able to do so, i would have worn it as a tunic. i am 5'5'' and the largest size would have been a racy mini skirt at best on me if worn as a dress. this dress is fit for only the tiniest and most small-breasted of people. that said, if the company were to try again ne",0
I love this top.the only thing negative is how thin and cheap the material feels.,1
"I really wanted to love this dress, but i think the proportions are very weird. i'm 5'7"" and usually go for an eight in unstructured dresses and a 10 in more structured dresses.
it runs small throughout, and is too short for me to feel comfortable wearing to work. the front is nicely detailed, but the back looks weirdly forgotten and could use more detailing. i tried on three different sizes (8,10,and 12) and they all pulled weirdly at the chest. there's a little slip that goes with the dress, w",0
"A successful first date sweater. the cut is flowy so don't expect snug. the quality is average for retailer sweaters, i guess nothing will ever be pill-free? the detailing at the bust reveals a little of what lies beneath, which in my case was just a bra but in more conservative environs might have to be a camisole.",1
This dress looked really nice on the hanger but when i put it on it was shorter than expected. i am 5'9 and it hit way above the knees. too short to be a work dress which was what i was hoping. might work better on someone shorter.,0
"This was such an adorable print that even though it was a bit pricey i decided to splurge! alas, the fit just wasn't good. it didn't look good on me and bunched up in all the wrong places. sadly, i had to return it. i've bought swimsuits from seafolly before and recommend the brand due to the high quality, unfortunately this particular style just didn't look that good on me.",0
"Dress is darling and well made. however, it runs very large. i tried to size down but then it became a little short in xsp. would be great for taller slim women. the style is so cute. the online picture does not do it justice.",1
"The model makes this dress look amazing, but it didn't translate that way on me. the print is really beautiful, i loved that, but the waist is huge and the skirt part is a-line and full, not streamlined like it looks on the model. if it was more like that this dress would be a hit. but, sadly, it's a miss. this is something your mom would love on you, but few others.",0
"This dress is a potato sack! from the picture i thought it was going to be a cute drop waist dress but the tailoring is so weird!! and it's huge on me, so maybe it would be better if i sized down but again based on the tailoring i think not. also the fabric is strange, not at all what i expected. i'm so sad :( i was really excited about this dress.",0
"I think the description and image might be slightly misleading and is giving this dress a bad name...it's not a drop waist dress as indicated in the description. it's a swingy a line silhouette- more fitted in the bodice and swingy as it its bells at the hem- which i find flattering. another discrepancy is that the brand is hd in paris, not glamorous. however i happened to find an online return at my local store and liked the print so i tried it on and fell in love with the 60s retro vibe and pr",1
"I've been stalking this suit online for months and i saw it in store yesterday. i never knew what size to order because of the australian sizing. i went with my pants size (8) and it looks great. i carry my weight in my butt and thighs and the boy legs are flattering! i found the size up (10) was loose in the bust for me. go for it, it's the cutest suit ever.",1
"I had the seafolly garden suit last year (same cut) and loved it. i decided the light blue color didn't look great on me so i decided to get this one. i found that the garden suit was cut smaller than this umbrella print one. right now i'm a 10 m and got the 12 in this, just like last time. i probably could've gotten the 10 but i'll keep the 12 for comfort. note: the leg holes are not tight and do not make upper thighs/butt squish out like you might imagine. try this suit!",1
"I wore this dress yesterday and was complemented wherever i went and asked where i purchased the dress. i love the linen and the back of the dress is so flattering. i ordered a medium and could have gone with a small, which i usually never wear, so i would order a size smaller.",1
"I love everything about this dress. it is comfortable, classic, good quality and fits really well. there are two layers to the material so nothing is see through.the styling on the back is to die for. there is a subtle gold line that runs through the blue and white stripes. the first day i wore this i received 5 compliments while shopping in a single store!

it is a bit loose in the middle, but i paired it with a skinny belt and it was the perfect fix. i can usually wear petite or regular. i p",1
I've gotten many compliments with this delightful dress. colors ar light and just right for a summer day. so comfortable and has a nice inner lining. very light and comfortable.,1
"I just purchased these joggers on-line during the sale and bought them in my usual size small and they fit me tts. i'm 5""4"" and just bought the regular and the length on me is perfect. these aren't super thick or anything so i think they'll do just fine during the spring and summer months when i just need a pair of pants to put on really quick or just to lounge around in. i find these quite comfortable and like that they have pockets too.",1
Pretty white pants with nice design at the bottom of the legs. had to have them hemmed a little.,1
"I did not have the issue that a previous reviewer did, there were ruffles on my shirt. the one thing i didn't know was how wide the top ran. i ordered my usual size 8 and it fit with no problems. i'm a 36b. the only thing is that in the model shot, the shirt is tucked into the pants and you don't get to see the full volume of it. even the model shot of the shirt from the back doesn't show the wide sleeves and body of the shirt. its not a big problem, since the shirt can be tucked but i will have",1
"I absolutely love everything about this top! i got compliments the first time i wore it. i do not find the fabric to be sheer at all, but perfectly lightweight for the heat of summer. the neckline and sleeves seem tailor-fitted for my body. i don't often think much about sleeves but these sleeves are the perfect length/shape to be incredibly flattering. they're in a sweet spot somewhere in between a cap sleeve and regular-length. the neckline is equally perfect and hugs my curves beautifully wit",1
"I hated to send this dress back, but my busty and curvy figure looked bigger and rounder in this dress. sent it back. it is meant for taller and more slender women.",0
I am 5 '5 and 119 pounds with an athletic cury body type. the dress wore bulky and ran large at size 2.,0
"I love this tee. i am long waisted and so many tops right now that are on the shorter side look silly on me so i was happy to find this. i'm 5' 5"" 118, 34b and bought and xs. it fits perfectly. the asymmetry is darling and the stripes are perfect for spring. it is a nice weight and i felt totally worth the money. it looks great so far after three washes and hang dries.",1
"This dress is nice colors and well made but it's just not the style for me. it almost fits frumpy. i'm not sure that a belt would even make it look good. also being 5'8, it is shorter than i'd wear. i like at least touching top of the foot for a maxi.",0
I just wore these and they were comfortable and didn't stretch our or become baggy throughout the day. i have three kids and am constantly moving. they're a nice in between weight and held up nicely. i have some from j.crew that stretch out and become baggy in the knees and backside and these didn't do that. i usually wear an 8/10 and i purchased a medium and they fit well. i would say that run a little big though.,1

"Gorgeous skirt. received so many compliments. the colors are perfect to match with many tops/jackets/sweaters....as well as different shoes/boots, bringing out the colors. i unfortunately ordered a large thinking it ran small and the large is too big in the waist so i will try to have it tailored. i like my skirts fuller in the hip area. i hope retailer offers more of this type of item. just adore it! for size i am a 8/10 in bottoms but since the skirt looked slim with out lining i ordered a large",1

"I have never had a purchase go wrong at retailer, which is why i am was not hesitant to spend this much money on the blazer. however, the quality is very poor - it feels like it might fall apart after one clean. also, the buttons where not sewn on properly. i wear an xs and the size was a good fit, but the overall quality was not worth the price (or even close to it).",0

"These pants are so adorable and fit perfectly (long enough even on my 5'10 frame) but i was forced to return because the white color is completely see through, even with nude panties. you can still clearly see them. so disappointed.",0
I ordered this pants in white and black. i read the reviews and weren't that bad. i am 5'6 and 125 lbs. i got them in size small. they are way too big. the small size seems to be xl and they are way too long for someone who is maybe 5'8 or 5'9. i have to returned them. quality is ok looking on my opinion.,0
"Loved the fit and colors, but the fabric is very thin and see-thru. i tried a nude cami underneath and the cami was completely visible. it did not look appropriate for anything that i wanted to wear the top to.",0
This dress has all the hallmarks of a classic. the fit of the bodice is form enhancing but modest and the flare is very feminine and swingy. i love the soft denim fabric though it smelled funny out of the package and i had to air it out. i am 140# 36dd and bought the size 8.,1
This shirt was a little shorter than i hoped but definitely too boxy if i had ordered up in size. i ordered xs based on reviews i usually wear a s. it looks great with higher rise jeans or dress pants.,1
"Was excited to receive this dress, as it had some great reviews. however, of the love was coming from the 5'5""+ set. as a petite, this didn't work well for me, and the fabric flattened me out in the bust in an awkward way. returned.",0
"I ordered this shirt in both white and coral. i absolutely love the design and coral color. the white was a bit see through, so i returned it. it would be cute with a cami under, but i just wanted something that did not require an extra layer. overall, it is a flattering fit and i love the detail on the back.",1
"Yes, $48 may feel like a lot to pay for a tshirt, but this is one is worth it -- i can wear this with *everything*! i bought this in grey, and the quality and style are just right to pair with a high waisted skirt or black skinny pants to wear out at night, or wear with regular jeans and a cardigan during the day. one of the best retailer purchases i've made in a while!",1
"For starters, the back pictured on the website is not true to the actual back of the shirt. the small traps are not there and it isn't gathered in the exact same way. the big bow is adjustable and overall i really loved the fit of the top, but the difference in design is not something i would expect from retailer. my shirt also got a hole in it along the seam in the back after washing once. although i liked the look of the top, the quality is not what i'm used to from retailer.",0

"This tee was meant to be loose and swishy, but as it runs large, sizing down means the sides come up really high, as they curve a good 3-4"" higher up. so your waistband is exposed, and it just doesn't look nice:( returned an xs and small.",0
I bought the mauve color and it's very pretty. i felt as though sizing up was a better choice. i'm usually an xs or a small and i went with the small. i liked the length of the small better. the shoulders add a cute look to it.,1

"Agreed that the pictures do not do this top justice. it's got shiny threads woven in the fabric and gives off an iridescent, colorful sheen. it can be dressed up or down, worn with a number of various styles - jeans, dress pants, skirts. the back adn arms are a tweed sweater knit, the front is an unforgiving acetate - dry clean only - hand wash will ruin this piece! i normally wear a small, but it was tight in the chest (34c) so i went with a medium and it worked fine.) no stretch in the acetate",1

"The colors and textures on this top are fun. however, the boxy shape isn't very flattering and poofs out a bit around the belly. maybe it would look a bit more feminine on someone with a curvier chest. i would size up if between sizes because the top part around the arms is not very roomy. i tried it on at the store but decided to pass because the xs was a little tight around the arms but the s billowed around the belly too much. still a cute piece if it works for you fit-wise.",1
"I ordered this in the blue, it's a beautiful shade of blue. love the lace up detail in the back, but the size small was just short and very wide. i understand it is a swing top, but this was not flattering on me. i'm short waisted, 34-d, 5'3, 125 lbs.  i'm sure it would be cute on a very thin person.",1

"I normally wear an xl, but could only find this instore in size large. the blouse fits nicely, but i think it would come down a bit lower and also be a longer blouse if i would have purchased it in my usual size. the blouse itself has a nice drape to it. the black 'railroad tracks' look very pretty in person, and add a nice detail. the only complaint i have with this blouse is the sleeves. the enormous bell sleeve feels like a costume. but for a nominal fee i had the sleeves shortened to a ruffl",1
"Really fantastic shirt. ordered multiple colors and will keep them all. the gray especially looks a bit boring online, but is gorgeous in real life. it has different shades mixed together and is really pretty. neckline is interesting. wish the front was a tad shorter, (i'm 5'4) but don't think petite will work. really, really great shirt.",1
"Like the idea of this shirt so much. but the neckline was still way too low- the top of my bra was visible. wishing the under layer really covered as no way i'm going to another layer to an already layered shirt. might just be my body type, so might work for someone else, but sending back.",0
I loved this t-shirt when i first tried it on: a good cut--not too drapey or fitted. but then i washed it (laid flat to dry) and it shrunk so much that it's unwearable now. so disappointing.,0
"I bought this shirt in 3 colors. soft, comfortable fabric, as other reviewers have mentioned, and nice detailed sleeve. i am gravely disappointed in the fabric quality since after wearing this one time with a necklace (as shown in the picture) it developed tiny pulls. i should mention that it was a very plain necklace, nothing sharp, pointy etc. i will most likely return all 3 shirts.",0
One wash wonder...i'm a s to m and went with a m but could have gone with a s with ease. after washing it was way shorter. it shrunk more than a whole size in cold water! i assumed everything came preshrunk but sadly disappointed. great for one wear.,0
Great sweater for any occasion. may be dressed up and/or worn with jeans. very versatile. love that it is short sleeves. size is true to fit.,1
I don't know why i never reviewed this beauty. i love the colors and pleats and contrasting embroidery. i'm busty,1
Love this top...bought in 2 colors...white and the orange. fun change to regular t-shirts....sized down because its flowy.,1
"This is a beautiful sweater with vibrant colors. it is versatile and can be worn throughout the year, it runs true to size and has become one of my favorite sweaters.",1
"I really like this skirt but unfortunately there is no lining, so it's a bit see through under the light. also there is no hook at the top of the zipper to secure the skirt. i just think that with this kind of price, the skirt should come at least with the lining. otherwise, it's beautiful skirt, flowy and very feminine.",1
"I washed and dried this in my dryer after one wear and it shrunk to the size of a toddler shirt. i dried it on medium. i can not really wear it unless i want to show off my belly. i loved the color (lilac). fit, and style when i received it and immediately put it on. so sad about the shrinkage. for a $58 shirt i expected a bit more. retailer should suggest air drying the shirt. so bummed and disappointed!!!! i would not recommend this shirt unless you can remember to air dry it every time.",0
I ordered this top despite the other reviews and i'm very glad i did. it is adorable. well made and very flattering. i am usually a size xs or 00 but based on the reviews sized up to a 0. fits perfectly. not snug at all. highly recommend!,1
"I love this dress! it is amazingly comfortable and flattering (i would think to many body types). i have a more athletic, petite body build and this dress gives me great curves. i have already received so many compliments while wearing it out! the best part is, i can wear it to work (i'm a teacher), and then wear it out by easily dressing it up.",1
The back of the shirt has a tag stitched in with red thread that goes through to the outside of the shirt. it is very visible and looks terrible - especially since the back is the focal point of the shirt. do not recommend,0
The shirt is very soft but it felt very large and unflattering. the back felt bulky and looked awkward. definitely returning.,0
"I wanted to love this dress... and i did until i turned around. the back seam didn't hang right. it pulled towards the knotted side, across my behind. i tried on two different xs that they has in store and both had the same issue. one of the dresses hung much looser, i had to recheck the tag because i didn't believe it was the same size! disappointing because it really is pretty and showcases curves nicely.",1
"I was bummed about this top. detail on back is pretty, even so, not worth it. i'm usually an xs i'm  120 lbs and it fit true to size. guess i had higher expectations. i'm feel consistently let down with what the pictures convey and the actual item when it arrives in person...",0
"I brought this shirt for a vacation, it fitted well and was flattering. totally a comfortable wear, however, after 1 wash on delicate & hang dry small holes appeared near the bottom. i am hoping i can return it. not worth the money.",0
"I just need to write a review on this sweater because it's the best!!! i currently own the cream/blue stripe sweater and have recieved many compliments. what i was most happy about it was the fact that i have washed it several times and the sweater looks like new and has held it's shape. i have ordered the gold one as well and it's still on backorder, waiting for it to arrive :) don't procrastinate, it's worth the price.",1
"I ordered a regular size s and it was way too boxy for my body type and shorter than the stated length. i don't know if the length stated is from a size m, but the small was definitely shorter (in the front at least).  if you're petite with curves like me, it's not a flattering cut.",0
"I usually love tops like this, i bought this is the store because if was so soft. got it home and was so disappointed because it is not very flattering at all.would be a great house top though because it is soft enough to sleep in.",0
"I'm 5'4"" 120# , 34d. this dress did nothing for me. the seem on the side with the knot doesn't look right. it's almost on the side but not really. there's a seem down the center of the butt from the waist. it looks weird from the back because it's such a fine striped print. not flattering at all. the dress is comfortable due to the stretchy knit and it has a stretchy knit lining. hit me just a bit lower than on the model.",0
This dress is made very well and can be dressed up or down! it can be worn with open toe wedges in spring and summer and cute booties in the fall.,1
"I was so disappointed when i received this top. the color is some washed-out faded version of the picture shown and the cut is much fuller than it looks in the picture. the back is cute but not worth the awful, drab actual color.",0
"The sweater is very very warm. it looks okay, not the best but not bad. i had high expectations so was disappointed to see no closure, i don't wear sweaters and jackets without closures. i like having the option of closing buttons if it gets any colder. so i am sending it back.",1
"This is a beautiful sweater. the photo doesn't do it justice. the model is wearing too large a size. i wear a l in moth and definitely looked better in the medium. the price is too high but the 25% savings thanksgiving weekend helps to blunt the pain. the lining is soft but was wrinkled on all the sweaters. the coloring is very flattering and, with care, this should be able to be worn for years. it can be used as a dressy coat sweater or fabulous over casual clothes. i wasn' particularly impress",1
It does run large. i got it on sale and it is a great sweater / coat for $200.00. i would not have paid the full price of 450.00 but i do love it. every time i wear it someone complements me.,1
"Love this jumpsuit, i was rather apprehensive as i didn't think it would look as good on me as on the model but i am totally smitten with it. very flattering, especially if you have some bumps and rolls. i ordered in a medium (5.7 and 145 lbs and it fits perfectly. definitely recommend to order down. 
as i'm wearing it to yoga i wear a sports bra underneath, that also helps with the very deep and open back to cover up a bit more. highly recommend, the top hits in all the right spots to make one",1
"I just received this today by mail, i am going to keep it as the reddish color is really pretty, it is very lightweight and will travel well for my summer vacations. however my first observation is the same as was noted in a previous review - not quite sure how to keep this dress in place - as soon as you move your arms around the dress goes out of place - and it slips back onto your shoulders . hopefully it will work out, will try a couple more times before i make a final decision i think.",1
Like the crossover design of this sweater. the v-neck is not low cut and can be worn without cami. sweater is thin but not find it to be see through although i always were tank tops under my shirts. did not find it to be itchy.,1
"I loved the fit and vibrant color of this dress. it's loose and flows but doesn't look like a potato sack. i wore it once and got a ton of compliments. that said, i hand washed it, as the tag states, then let it line dry, and it shrunk to half its size! i re-checked the tag and noticed that under the hand wash instructions it then states ""dry clean recommended."" boo. so disappointed that i spend over $100 for a dress i wore once.",0
"Ok. so this coat is amazing! it's high quality, soft, great pattern. the knit lining helps to make this more of a light weight coat than a sweater type coat. it's been warmer this season so i've worn it as a coat and received many compliments. it might not be warm enough for january in new england but i bought a size up so i could wear it over a sweater and still use it as a coat. this was purchased on sale w 25% off sale code, so for me, that was a steal. so happy it went on sale! give it a try",1
"I'm usually a small (5'5"", 116 lbs, long torso), but the x-small fit well. the black does look see-through in the pictures, but i figured i could wear a cami with it. it is see-through in person if you are up close, mainly in the back and arms since the front has extra fabric in places. however, it is rather short, possibly because it is an x-small, and i'll need a short cami to fit under it or will have to have a cami hanging out of the bottom, which drapes nicely and a cami may mar that effect",0
"Beautiful dress...appropriate for sunday, and special occasions. grab a 'honey slip' to compensate for the sheerness, and you're set! one star off for static cling. otherwise, no regrets with this purchase.",1
Runs a tad big but not enough to say it runs large if that makes sense - but just beautiful!,1
Yes! this dress is so lovely. i wear a size 6. a size 6 in this was perfect. under slip over a delicate overlay. heading to italy and this will be so perfect. drape is so flattering. colors are feminine. cut is lovely. effortlessly elegant and reads much more expensive. don't hesitate. a special one.,1
"I'm surprised to be unhappy with this... reading all the rave reviews. but, i had a different experience with it. the cut is funky... and seemed much more tapered on me than on the model in the picture. i think if you're very slim, this may work well, but for any curves or hips... not so flattering... imo. i think it's a pretty jacket... but not for me... it's going back. and ps... i paid $448 for it and see it's on sale for about 1/2 that just a week later. the discounted price may be a good de",1
"When i received this dress in the mail, i was thrilled. i loved the color and the style, although a bit too much material but comfortable. when i went to show my husband the dress, his first comment was very sexy. i can see your underwear and your skin!!! i don't understand why no one mentioned this in any of the comments on this dress. when i went into the light i saw that the dress was see through and i sadly had to return it.",0
"This dress is so beautiful. i am 50 5'8"" and smaller on top larger on bottom. size 6 is perfect! was worried that it would hit me in all the wrong places. happy to say it does not. wore it for the first time yesterday and no lie i received no less than 15 compliments from strangers. just walked up to tell me how great the dress was. colors are so soft and beautiful. would buy in other colors if they had it. i can see myself wearing it to a casual dinner, to a wedding our just to feel special on",1
Like my title suggests this is lovely and perfect for summer. the lining however is not silk it's rayon and sat weird on me. it offered no coverage on my top and actually is quite useless (i do have a large bust). i have a free people slip that will work and because of that will i'm keeping the dress. the outer shell is silk and really lovely and the colours are true to the picture.,1
"The print, colors and fabric of this sweater are lovely. the design is quirky to say the least. i ordered a small, as i usually do. i am 5'2"" and weigh 120lbs. this sweater somewhat gathers or balloons out at the hip area and is so huge that it looked like i was wearing a giant table cloth or stadium blanket. it looked like i had a pillow stuffed in my backside because of how the sweater gathers up at the waist. it's not flattering at all.",0
I really like the color and flow of this dress. the dress itself fit well however the slip was extremely tight through the bust. i have a large bust at 34d however most dresses are still wearable especially flowy dresses. unfortunately i had to return this one because of the slip.,0
I ordered this in hopes of wearing as a tunic with leggings for my rehearsal dinner. it is much shorter than expected and wouldn't have looked right with leggings. it also was more gray than ivory and in the short time i had it on was shedding lint like crazy. beautiful in photos but didn't work for me.,0
"Very cute shorts. sadly, after one wash they became a lint magnet so had to be returned. disappointing quality.",0
"I was very excited to get this dress in the mail. i wasn't sure about the sizing because there weren't any reviews written yet. i got the m which fit across my chest area and fit fine, but there was just so much fabric below the bust. i love that it's different, but i think you'd have to be a stick figure for this shape to work for you. it does not flatter your body at all.",0
"I really like this shirt. it runs somewhat big but i love the oversized effect as seen on the model. i normally wear a m in shirts and the s was spot on. the only quality issue is with the buttons..they are a bit flimsy when you unbutton them. other than that, this is a great shirt and the price with the promo is just right.",1
"Buttons were broken off when i opened the package, stretchy at waist, not good quality for the price.",0
A pretty blouse but the polyester fabric makes it incredibly warm and uncomfortable on after a while. had to return it.,0
Well made gorgeous skirt that can be worn with heels and lace top or tee shirt and big jewelry. true to size. i am a 2/4 and the extra small was great. poofs out a bit but not like you're a fairy. i would say the blue (which i ordered) is more of a seafoam / mint green which is also lovely and spring time.,1
I love wide-leg pants and i'm so glad they're back. i bought this pair in the navy and cream colors as soon as i saw them online. i bought my usual size 28 in retailer and they fit just fine. the navy color is more like a dark blue but still perfect for spring/summer. comfortable material and overall good quality. i just wish they came in more colors.,1
"These pants are so comfortable and i love the color, but they did not work for me.",1
"This is the best dress. i received it last week and have already worn it three times. perfect fit. casual and so easy but the length and front details make it so fun. thicker than many other ""tshirt"" dresses... but light enough that i wasn't overly hot on super warm days. def recommend!!!!",1
"If i hadn't seen the description online, i would never have known these pants were navy! 
i bought them today and tried them on with a black tunic which looked fantastic. the style is very similar to cartonnier slim pant but the fabric is lighter weight and stretchier.
since i'm heavy around the stomach, i will wear the pant with a long tunic top (to avoid the drumstick look) which is a shame since the pockets are so cute. the colors in the pants mean that you can match and contrast with a wid",1
"This looks exactly as shown in the photo. you can tell that it's a really thin, lightweight knit that's almost transparent.  i ordered a large and it fits the way it does on the model. am returning because i have a large 34 g bust and this top really emphasized my chest. it also grabs a bit under the arms. the color looks just like it does in the photos. it hangs nicely and isn't oversized, which i liked. the texture and ribbing on the sleeves, hem and pocket take this a step up from the ordinar",1
It's just ok. very thin and feel like it might say and stretch. color is very nice but much thinner and sheer we than what i wanted.,0
"I just love all pilcro pants. they are great for any occasion, any type of weather. i am 5'5"" 125 lb. and i wear a 27 in all pilcro pants and they fit perfectly. only bummer is that i have to iron them, but they iron easily. length of these pants is just a tad long, but i can wear wedges with them and that solves the problem.",1
"This top is super cute and colorful. admittedly, i have not used it just as a pajama top because i think the world deserves to see this piece of art. super comfy and i recommend this for everyone in most shapes and sizes!",1
"Great color but frumpy fit. if you have any bust, it looks a bit like maternity",0
"These are very cute and i bought both colors. they are accurately pictured. however, right out of the bag they had an especially strong chemical-type odor. must be the dye. i have been airing them outside in the sun trying to decide if i will keep them. they seem to be ""calming down"" a bit but it's been two days!! they are not jersey but are a non-stretchy type fabric with a slight sheen. dress up or down. i'm a 00 or 24 and the xs fit well.",1
Made my wedding outfit perfect!,1
Dress just did not fit will around the hips.  also the string belt was defective - basically about to come off.  looks like someone may have wore it and returned it.  was not flattering at all.,0
"These pants are a heavier twill than the pilcro chinos i bought from retailer earlier this year. these weightier wide leg trousers have a perfect drape. my size is between a petite 26 and a petite 27. the size petite 26 fit me well so i judge them to be a 1/2 size large. 
if i had written the review before washing them i would have given an overall rating of 5 stars. after washing once in cold water detergent and regular wash, the color lost a lot of blue. the color went from a wonderful fresh/sp",1
"This is such a beautiful top, so flattering, soft and comfortable.  it is great as a layering piece.  the colors are vibrant.  the blue is a gorgeous blue, a deep cobalt blue.  i got one in every color.",1
"I own this in the dark blue and adore it. i read reviews later as i was pondering buying the white (why is it so hard to find a white shirt anymore that isn't see-through?!). one of the first reviewers raved that it wasn't see-through. i ordered it and ... nope, it's totally see-through. i tried it on and immediately saw the entire outline of my nude bra, and worse still - my belly button. back it went. i got the green instead. bummer about the white - fabric's different than the others.",1
Beautiful dress that is very flattering! wearing it to my bridal shower.  more appropriate for spring or summer!,1
"This is a very appealing and flattering tee! the details really make this quite lovely: the back pleat makes the fit fabulous and motion ideal, the stitching at the neckline is attractive and artistically pleasing, the proportions are balanced, nothing too full or tight. although the tee is 100% cotton, the pocket is 100% polyester, quite silky and a nice accent. i bought the ""white"", which is more of an ivory and gorgeous, with complementary deeper ivory stitching. my usual medium fits great (s",1
Very orange. the slits in the back are larger than pictured and not at the cutest part of anyone's anatomy... shorter in front and i have a short torso. the fabric is nice and lightweight.,0
"I actually had no problem with the neck hole of this shirt, even with the xs size. however, i had a huge issue with the bottom eyelet section. it's so tight! it stretches across my thighs and looks so funny, as the top part is still loose. i tried moving up to a size small and still had this problem. maybe just not for girls with thighs ... very strange fit.",0
"I loved this dress after seeing it online.it is a pullover dress, and is easy to get on. my major problem with the dress is that the waist is extremely high (about 3 inches over my natural waist), and i usually have no problem with the placement of the waist in dresses. i'm going to keep the dress because i like everything else about it: the fit is flattering and the dress will be seasonless here in california. i""ll search for a wide belt to cover the waistline, or perhaps skip a belt altogether",1
"This is a very nice top, but it is very loose and swingy indeed. i sized down one size, and it still is very relaxes. the material is soft, the colors are nice.",1
"I bought the calia tunic in blk/wht and in red motif. i love the black and white one. the cut is flattering and stylish. comfortable. you can dress it up or down. all good. 
the red motif is cut differently. the neckline is very low. the shape is different from the black and white one. i am not sure why but i returned it.
neither shirt is as long as the one pictured on the model. i would recommend the black and white one though.",1
I love this top and the relaxed fit. can be dressed up or down. i bought the bird print and liked it so much i purchased the umbrella print. now i'm contemplating getting the mixed dot! easy to just throw on with anything and the mix of colors keeps it versatile too!,1
"I'm in love with this top! i usually wear a s/m or 6, and the size 6 fits perfectly. the cut is very flattering and i love that the sleeves can be worn rolled up and buttoned or down (and when they're down they hit right at the wrist, not too long or short). it's lightweight and comfy, but looks really pulled together. i can see myself wearing this both with ripped boyfriend jeans and sneakers and with dress pants and a blazer. a great transitional piece.

i only wish this came in solid white (o",1
"The fit was fine, but the fabric (the beige option) was bland. it washed me out. granted, i'm fair skinned, but it reminded me of sour milk. it's getting returned.",0
"I bought these for next year. ordered both 27 & 28 and kept the 27, which i would say is a pretty true 6.",1
The design of these is adorable with the lace up ties however they are a dingy looking off white color. they are also pretty see through. returned.,0
This shirt is very comfortable and i received a lot of compliments when i wore it. i bought the neutral print and everyone wants to get close to see what it is . i would buy another if it came in this type of pattern.,1
I got two of the shirt am totally in love with them. i didn't get the one in black only because i have too many things in black. the shirts look awesome with leggings or skinny jeans. i'm very happy with this purchase!!!,1
"They fit snug and accentuate all the right curves. they could be shorter. the lace up sides are interesting, but i might sacrifice the lace ups for making them shorter. actually they are cuter on in person than in this photo.",1
"I saw a sales associate (sa) wearing it at my local retailer and totally loved it. this t-shirt runs very large, so it depends on how one wants to wear it. the sa wore it oversized and tied to the side, super cute. i tried on a regular small and it was still 2 sizes too big and too long on me. i ordered the xs petite and it fits perfectly, not too fitted and not too loose (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). my mother was a great embroider and the ""giddy up"" embroidery work at the neckline and the",1
I bought this in size xl in the moss color. it fits true to size. it's very comfortable--the fabric is soft. i love the draping of this top. i'm a pear-shape and this type of cut is my favorite. the moss color looks black online but is really a dark forest green. i'd love to see this top made in other colors.,1
"I loved this shirt and attempted to buy it - however the armhole is so small i couldn't barely get the shirt off and almost had to call someone into the dressing room to pull it off of me. i'm usually a 6 and i tried on the 6 and 8, and both shirts had the same problem. it wasn't exactly the sleeve that was too tight, but the arm hole that was not big enough. it pulled across the top of my chest and was not roomy enough to slip in and out of. which was odd because the rest of shirt was fine. i d",0
"I have a pair of mih jeans that are the only jeans i own that i absolutely love. everything about them. this jumper looked versatile, useful and fun, so i splurged during the 25% off dress sale.

my experience with mih is that the sizing runs true, or european, and thus small. i ordered this in a medium and it is gargantuan as well as virtually shapeless. it looked horrible from every angle: front, back and sides. i cannot imagine it having more fit even in a smaller size.

the fabric is nice, p",0
"I was really intrigued by this swimsuit when i saw it online but i wasn't sure how it would look on me but the reviews convinced me i should get it and figured if i didn't like it i could just return it. i love this suit, the color is beautiful and the high neckline is off-set by the open back. for anyone who has a large chest, which i do (32g), this is one of the most secure/supportive swimsuit i have ever tried on. do not hesitate to buy this suit, though i would go a size up if you have a lar",1
This was surprisingly more complimentary and easier to wear than i though it would be. i love vix bathing suits and the quality is exceptional!,1
"Despite other reviewers comments on size - i really wanted this one to work so i ordered it. i'm typically a size xs and d chest and instead i ordered a small. the body of the sit for well but the cups of the suit i'd said for more for a b.

"This dress is even prettier in person. i'm 5'5"" and usually a 4 in fit and flare dresses and got this in a 4. fits like a glove and hits right above my knee. the hook and eye closure does get caught on the delicate lace, so be careful of that. otherwise, this dress is perfect for summer weddings!",1
"These were perfect in the legs, nice and stretchy, but problematic in the waist. i'm generally a 31/size 12, but i had to squeeze to get them to close.
they've already gone back. if you have a tinier waist they'd probably be fine.",0
"Loved the design and quality of this suit but the cups seemed huge. i weight 135lbs 5'6"" and wear a 34c. i bought a large in this suit because other reviews said it ran small (normally i wear a size medium) i did like how it fit everywhere expect the chest. i'm wondering if the medium will still be too large in the chest and hoping the rest would still fit okay. not sure i want to go through the hassle to exchange and it not fit again! it's so cute otherwise and would be perfect if you have a la",0
"This suit is better than i expected. i'm a large d cup and with this type of top style, i typically size up. i'm a 4 bottom but would normally would order a large top because this type of top runs small...not here. i ordered the large and, much to my suprise, it's too big. i'm sending back. i may order a small and medium just to be safe, but the cups are definitely not cut too small here. the bodice is very flattering with the black and white contrast. so pretty!",1
"Disappointed :-(
this top has a boxy shape and looked like a mini moo moo on me. i have a similar shape as the model and it looked nothing like that on me. bummer! i liked the quality and weight (not too heavy nor too light) but shape is unflattering. it's going back.",0
"I went to the store specifically to try this dress on, because i was captivated by the photos online but worried about the fit. it was just as pretty or even prettier in real life, but unfortunately i couldn't fill out the top. there was gaping even when i went down to a size 0, even though i mostly wear a 4 and sometimes a 2 in retailer dresses. (the 0 fit me everywhere else, which is why i'm saying this dress runs small.) would it have worked with a padded bra, or for someone with more cup size?",1
"I chose this dress to try to flatter an hourglass figure, but was disappointed. the fabric is a beautiful soft, fine silk, but unforgiving. the cut is not truly a wrap, and, with a fixed thin elastic waistband, was too short waisted for me. while the model looks elongated, the thin line under my bust created two poofy sections... not flattering at all. while i was drawn to the shape for my body type, it may be better suited to another. happy hunting!",0
"Very pretty dress, the blue is a little lighter than navy but is still really nice. the embroidered flowers are lovely as well. the a-line cut is very flattering on. i can't wait to wear this dress this spring!",1
Great quality and works in many ways! highly recommend.,1
Love this dress so beautiful embroidery is lovely....well worth the price!!!,1
"I loved almost everything about this skirt. thick and lined and love the buttons. comfortable. the only problem was that the two sides flared out at the bottom, presumably from the buttons. i was torn, but in the end it just looked too silly and it was sent back.",0
"This is the first time that i have tried mother jeans, and i am a fan. these jeans fit tts, and the high waist is flattering and stays put. i personally am a big fan of the distressing - it's just enough, but not too much - and it's lined on the inside so it won't get worse. i know some people won't like that, but i did. also, they hit right below my ankle (i'm 5'5"") instead of being a few inches too long -- a major bonus. thus, they look great rolled or not. but perhaps most importantly, these",1
"I am curvy and this top, while stylish and i love the pockets, just didn't do it for me. it made my shoulders look wider than they are, which is a big no no. it would probably look better on someone with smaller shoulders or slimmer. the wool was also a tad itchy - not too itchy, just a bit. in general i don't wear wool without cashmere, i also don't wear non-italian wool because it is a bit rough and my skin reacts to it. so i stick to wool cashmere blend or loro piana soft wool. this sweater s",0
"I took a chance on this top because i loved the color and print. it is mostly as pictured, but because i have a larger chest, the peplum didn't hit me in the right place. it would probably work fine for someone thinner with a smaller chest. i was surprised that it was also somewhat sheer, which was disappointing considering the price. i returned it.",0
"I ordered this online, and took it back the day i got it. i could not fit the neck hole over my head, therefore i couldn't even see how it truly fit. i had high hopes for this dress.",0
"This dress is black and white as pictured (as opposed to actually being cream), and it fits true to size. i've found that this particular brand runs tight in the shoulders for me, but that isn't the case here. the cut is very flattering, and it's great that this has functional pockets.

i was excited that the skirt is fully lined, but the top is ridiculously sheer. even with a nude bra, this dress needs a camisole underneath it. it's so flattering, but i'm not sure if i'll keep it.",1
Runs a little small in the shoulders/bust,1
"I really wanted to love this dress. i thought i might be able to dress it up for a wedding i'm attending, but it was kind of a serious no go. first off, i ordered a petite size, but it was still longer than on the model--i'm 5'5', so not even technically petite, but i thought it might be a better length for me that way. it was not a great length, and the pleats and pockets (which would be great in theory) make the skirt fully (and pouffier at the waist) than i would have liked. i love the way th",0
"I tried this dress on in an xs petite. the dress runs slightly bigger, it sort of looked like a tent on me, whereas other xs p dresses at retailer fit tts. the other thing is that the dress just doesn't look like an almost $200 dress. the band that runs across the bust goes under the arms too. it isn't sewn in though, and it was folding down under the arms, making it look like its ripping off. the collar too seemed to pull down right in the center, as if the material was too heavy to stand it's we",0
"I love jumpsuits - except for this one. the fabric is blah. it's between plastic and the material that they make flags out of. the print is adorable and the buttons up the front are super cute. the tie thing that's just hanging there?  it's a tie thing that just hangs there. it doesn't  look good hanging, and it doesn't look good tied.  this jumpsuit had so much potential. i'm definitely disappointed.  for sizing reference, i am 5'5"", 135, 34c and a small was perfect.",0
"I ordered this tee despite the price. the fabric is very thin and the quality was poor. nice concept for a tee, but failed in quality and value. it was returned.",0
I love this dress. it is beautiful and the quality is superb.. i too found it tight in the neck area. i had to untie it as other reviewers have mentioned. nice casual dress.. very comfortable and perfect for vacation this summer.,1
"Dress is wonderfully made. the fabric is soft and the print is beautiful.wonderful detail,especially the ties.  nice lining...not see thru at all.
mid calf length looks good with heels or flats.
lovely dress for a sunny day or an evening out!!",1
"I thought it was the perfect dress by the picture but it ended up looking like a grandma muumuu. the color is nice, the neck is cute, but the form unflattering. i'm trying to decide if i want to taylor it or take it back.",0
"I was so excited that retailer finally had some bermuda shorts for those of us that are 1) older and don't want to show off that much leg anymore, and 2) are ""curvy on the bottom"" and really cannot wear the shorter shorts. i ordered these immediately in the navy. i usually wear a 31 in pilcro jeans, and like the other reviewer observed as well, i was floating in these - not only in the waist but everywhere. the legs are big - but it's supposed to be a boyfriend cut so i get that, but they just are",0
"I bought these for a trip to the caribbean. i sweat a lot. if you have ever been humiliated by having a ring of sweat around your crotch area, then i do not recommend these shorts in the moss color. this color and fabric do not camouflage sweat. i will spare you the photos.",0
"Joggers are my new style this spring/summer i think. i love the simplicity of this style. the cut is perfect, very true to size. i like the longer length - perfect to wear with kitten heels, flats, or slip on canvas. this color especially is really versatile and make them my go to pants once a week for a perfectly put together outfit.",1
"Wanted to love this.. love rompers, but the opening between your chest was oddly designed, it was gapping and certainly couldn't bend over without showing lots.. fabric seemed heavy for the summer. all in all it was too full, made me feel frumpy..",0
I saw this sweater at the store and instantly love it. it run large. i am 5'8 and 120 pounds and usually a size s in most retailer tops. i had to go with xxs on this one so def size down.,1
"Great, easy to wear addition to the wardrobe. i wore it all day today and no pilling! plus the pockets are really convenient...they are a good depth for car keys or a small wallet. i'm pretty busty (32ddd) and have a curvy body...with that said, the small fit well. i prefer wearing it with the zippers opened because my behind and hips look odd with the sweater fully zipped...(for ref 36 inch hips). give this one a shot...it's a nice surprise.",1
"I was so excited to try these, it's hard to find cute bermuda shorts. the legs were so wide. my husband asked if i was wearing his shorts. they don't look that wide in the picture. i am 5'4"" and 130 lbs i bought my regular size 28 but the waist was huge i could have sized down one or two sizes. unrolled they came to my knee.",0
"I grabbed this dress to try on in my usual size, because i needed to see what the hype was about this style of dress, and it left me puzzled.  the print was pretty, but no amount of tailoring could save it for me.  it was wearing me.  maybe it could wear three of me.  i feel like this is a way for clothing manufacturers to cut corners, by making a garment without details (no installing more time consuming zippers, buttons or snaps, and making something that fits a wide range of sizes because it",0
"The minute i put this on i knew it was wrong. firstly, the neck was quite tight and i had to untie the side tie. secondly, as i stood looking in the mirror, the dress simply read ""nightgown"". it was frumpy and too long on me. so back it went.",0
"This tunic is so stylish and pretty. the fit is close but not clingy (5'4, 116 lbs., size xs) and the rear coverage is just right to wear with skinny jeans or leggings. the fit is flattering whether the zippers are up or down, without riding up around the waist. the cowled collar falls around the neck evenly without the bulky look that similar styles can sometimes lend. the moss color is pretty, the fabric is soft and warm yet still fairly lightweight. if the pockets are properly tucked and layi",1
"While overall it's a pretty top, there were a few surprises. the biggest one not listed is that the bottom has a thin elastic band! without it, the top would be wide, longer and flow. in the picture to get it to the length shown, the elastic is pulled up toward the waist. which could work for some, as you can adjust the length into a tucked in look. it could be cut off, and sewn, making a normal flowy top. i am a normal size 6 and the shoulders are off, and the sleeve length is long with elastic",1
"Yikes. there is a whole lot of skirt here. i am 5""4, weigh around 120 lb, and usually wear anywhere between a four and six in retailer clothing, depending on the designer. this skirt balloons out from the waist. on the website it seems to flow more naturally from the waist. i think that the flowers are cute but the material is cheap looking. the skirt is very long- hitting way below mid-calf. there is also tons of material - creating a parachute effect. definitely returning.",0
"I love love love this print and had to have it when retailer had their 25% off sale. i think regular price is way too much for this dress as the dress isn't even silk or a better material. but once i got this i was so disappointed, i ordered my usual size and it was just a balloon/tent on me. i felt like i was wearing a maternity dress. plus the ruffle at the top which i thought was a sweet feature felt really awkward and like it was grazing my neck and chin in an annoying way. i don't even want t",0
"I thought the dress was ok, but was surprised by the cut away triangles of material right under bra band on the sides of dress. i will send back, also a bit too high waisted for me. other than that, the dress is as it appears.",0
"Love this dress. i think i scored the deal of the year with this one. found it in my local retailer store. it had been in my ""save for later"" forever but i couldn't bring myself to pay full price... then it sold out in my size online. i was in my local store browsing the new items on sale with the additional 40% off, and there it was 1, and only 1. and my size.... i picked it up, noticed the cut outs that are not very apparent in the online photos, but it back, picked it back up, put it back.....",1
"At 5'4"", i guess i am just too short to pull this dress off! the colors are so pretty for summer, but there is just too much fabric... i felt like i was wearing a giant doily! however, there is not a doubt in my mind that taller girls would look fabulous in this!",0
"When i received this top, i thought it was even prettier than the online picture. the colors and beading are more vibrant in person. it is a full cut and does have an elastic band at the bottom but i liked the way it looked on. i ordered my usual size m and it fit me the same as it did the model in the picture. it is pretty shear. if you wear it to work or during the daytime, it will need a cami. however, in evening lighting, i don't find it to be that see through and i feel comfortable wearing",1
"When i saw this online, i wondered why this dress cost so much. i have been keeping my eye on it for some time. loved what i saw, the design and colors and details at the neckline and waist along with pockets but was skeptical. i was waiting for a sale to take a dive and here are my thoughts when i got it:
___________
pros:
- the colors you see online are exactly the same in person.
- the jeweled neckline is lovely. it's one thing that drew me to it. this dress had a very sophisticated appeal wh",0
"I'm 119 and small frame, but took a chance and ordered the m. so glad...the fit was perfect. the robe is soft and beautiful!",1
"This is beautiful and fits perfect. it's even prettier in person, and extremely comfortable and high quality. i'm 5'3"" and it hits right above the knee. the straps are adjustable and fits true to size. i bought an xs and it fits perfect. must buy for a sweet little night gown!",1
"Haven't decided if i'm going to keep this dress yet. it arrived torn at the seams, but was able to use two sided tape to fix and straps were sewn on twisted. in my opinion it is not worth full price. i would say it runs tts. i'm between and 4 and a 6 and the size sp fit perfect, however, the petite size runs pretty long. it says 47 inches from shoulder but i need to wear it with 5 inch heels. mine may have been a wrong size marked issue.
dress looks exactly as in the picture.",1
"These are the perfect higher waisted skinny jeans. high enough that there is no muffin top, but not so high they look like mom jeans. typical ag super soft fabric. they are like wearing sweat pants. so worth the extra money for the ag jeans. love the length too.",1
"This top came down to my hip bones, but i am short-waisted. the shirt definitely fits shorter than in the photo. the measurements listed for ""regular"" seem to be a bit shorter than the 26"" l measurement i got when i measured it. i think the quality is nice, and though it could likely easily snag if you're not one who is used to wearing delicate clothing, i didn't find this top to be flimsy at all. for reference i purchased a l and the fit is more form-fitting on me than it is on the model, but n",1
"I love this top! it flows nicely and fits perfectly. i'm 5' 4 1/2"", 125 lbs. and ordered the small. i love the little bit of sparkle in the blouse, too.",1
"This is a very beautiful dress, with the detail of the inside lining, with a very beautiful fabric as well, creating a double layer effect, it creates a great flow. i am not sure i would use it with the belt (which is beautiful, a part of it is crochet), but if i don't, the dress would be too long. i am a size xl and 5'6"", so if you are shorter than that, i would try it before buying it. since it's getting cold here in colorado, i'll have to wait for next year to really experience going out with",1
"This is a gorgeous flowy top. i paired it with a pair of army green pants and have received a ton of compliments. you can dress this top up for a night out or for work, or style it for a fun evening out. you will be very pleased with this top.",1
"This is a very lovely looking sweater. unfortunately, it runs incredibly small. i'm only 5'3"" and the size small hit me above my mid-rise jeans. it doesn't fit at all how it's shown on the model. it's also a very delicate fabric. seems like it would snag easily. i was really hoping it would work as i used my birthday discount to purchase it, but i'm sending it back.",0
"I loved the look of this blouse online. i really wanted a cute eyelet top for summer. the blouse looked great out of the package but the fit was not good. i am a 00p and 32 b bra size, this top was too tight across my chest but billowed out in the back. its as if the armholes were too far forward. it is fairly short but i am short waisted. i really wanted this top to work but i had to return it. if i went up one size the back of the blouse would have been ridiculously large and the top was too e",0

I love that the dress slip got a different pattern. very easy fun for summer but you can also layer it in fall,1

This maxi dress is exactly what i had in mind! the fabric is very comfortable. the print is very nice. perfect find!,1
"I most often fit into a size medium. based on prior reviews, i ordered this dress in a small and it fits perfectly. it drapes nicely. the fabric is soft and flows well. the under layer has a nice little stretch to it. the dress looks good with and without the belt. my favorite and most-slimming look is to just tie cinch and tie it in the back, such that it does not wrap around the front at all. the dress is so comfortable and the neckline is very flattering. no bra needed for my small bust.",1
"Beautiful in pictures and i loved it before i tried it on. as the other reviews state, it is short and wide. i like the top so much, i am going to try to add some gathering across the back to offer some shape. otherwise it is an unflattering shapeless box :(",0
These pants lived up to expectations. the fabric is very soft and did not wrinkle in the dryer. i am normally not a big fan of cropped styles but love that these have the gathered leg and can be styled dressier or casual. i thought the cargo pockets might stick out too much but they lay nicely. i feel i will get a lot of use from these and the best part is they are not constrictive and they are super comfy.,1
"In my opinion, for this amount of money, the dress needs to be something really different. and this one isn't. it has several structural issues and it seems to have a split personality (summery material, dark color, flirty and fun...but overly conservative up top.)

initially, the top portion is extremely sheer. you're saved (a bit) by the extra fabric at the front, but it still seemed odd that the top isn't lined - particularly for a dress meant for winter.

there's too much going on up top. th",0
"This dress has a beautiful purple paisley print and reminds me of classic retailer from years ago. i wanted to love the dress but it runs extremely large. i usually wear a 00p or xxsp and got this in an xxsp but was still way too big. while the intent is to be flowy, i was overwhelmed by the bagginess and it changes the style from flowy to bag-like. while the belt helps cinch the waist, i had too much bunching in the waist area making it unattractive. very disappointed as its such a pretty",0
"This dress is absolutely lovely, from the neckline to the fabric. really feels like a well made dress. i will say that it ran larger than i thought though, so keep that in mind. it is more of a shift dress than the pictures suggest. still gorgeous though!",1

These jeans are very comfortable. i really like the high waist. just what i was looking for!,1
"I just got this in the mail and was so excited to try this cute top.....but it's completely see-through! unlike the photo shows, the lining is not included. quite a disappointment top is well made though no give in the fabric.",0
These are cute and light weight however the fit is off. i ordered my normal size large (i'm a 12/14.). the waist was large but fit ok. they were really tight across the theighs. the crop length is fine with my 5'9 height. if i hadn't got such a good sale of probably return them. they will be good lounge pants.,1
"Call my corny but this dress inspires me to run barefoot through the lavender fields in provence.  the flowy layers and dreamy prints are mesmerizing.  fit is ideal for my body type as long as you size down.  i had no weird sagging, bagging or poofiness.  and i love the macrame belt!  i tied it offset to the side but the dress looks good unbelted too.  i purchased the small petite.

"I really wanted to love this coat. it is well made and unique. i usually buy the petite versions but they were sold out.
however i went ahead and purchased a regular size because i wanted a second winter coat.
sadly, it looked more like a cocoon coat on me. it stuck out at the back. probably because it was not a petite. it pulled across my chest, like shoulders were too short. for reference, i am 5 feet, 109lbs, and a 32d.

"I should have paid closer attention to the other reviews. i could barely get this blouse over my head! after getting it on, the armholes too are very small. the blouse other than that is pretty and very girlie. i love the pleating and dolman sleeves but i was strangled around my neck. i tried the small but think a medium wouldn't have been much better. it needs a button opening on neck and sleeves. i would have to put this on before makeup or doing my hair.

"Fit is ""breezy"" which is what i expected. a little on the loose side but comfortable and still cute. the slip that accompanies the dress is of decent quality as well.  the back of the dress is not that much longer than the front, as in the picture, but i still liked the dress enough to keep it.",1
"I decided to take advantage of the free shipping despite seeing no reviews yet. i received the dress today and it is exactly as pictured, only about 3 inches shorter. i am usually between an xs and s but chose the xs because of late, everything i seem to order is huge. this was an exception and i could have ordered the s. color was as pictured, a nice green. fabric was a gauzy cotton. the dress was just ""alright"". nothing special to warrant the price tag. it felt like a little girl's dress on me",0
"The orange version is very nice, bright but not tacky. the fit is super flattering, and i love the crisscrossed hem. the top part is also flattering on the shoulders (halter), but need a strapless bra. the 0 fit me well, no need for petite on that one, might be too short for me.

"This top is very pretty, but it fits funny. it's boxy and doesn't hang well. i feel like you could almost wear it as a 2nd-trimester-pregnancy-blouse. i tried the small & the small petite. they both fit the same (too big and too boxy), but the petite was shorter. i am 5'2"", 125lbs, 34b. i preferred the regular length, but if you like your tops to end at your waistband, then the petite would fit too. i still really like the top, so i may try it in a smaller size when it goes on sale.",0
"I wanted to love this top. but, it looks like an ambitious 12 year old made it with rumpled fabric and lace found in her grandmothers attic. re: hopeful, but not good. the quality is not good and it hangs strangely on. sadly it is going back.",0
"Like other reviewers, i tried on a medium and a large as i usually take either size in retailer dresses. the large was huge on me - i had an extra 6 inches or so on each side. the next medium that i tried on could barely fit over my head! i looked at the tag to see if i had picked up an extra small but it stated medium. got another medium and it fit perfectly. however, the cami underneath one medium was again teeny tiny. the other medium was ok. you may have to try on a few dresses to get the righ",1
"I am a true size small and i ordered this dress and it was way big. it's meant to be a relaxed fit, but it sagged under the arm-holes because the bust was way too big. some folks are saying it ran small and they are essentially the same measurements as me, so it makes me think there is possibly some variation in each size. i got on here to reorder in a smaller size, but now am not sure what to do as i need a dress with in the next three days!",0
"I don't love this dress but i really like it a lot, hence the four stars. i opted for the light blue. the embroidery is a rich, vibrant blue and quite beautifully done. i am 5' 6"" and 125 lbs. and the xs fits perfectly. it's intended to be a looser cut but it isn't at all frumpy and it hangs nicely. and it has pockets! all around a good summer staple.",1
I found the fit of this dress odd. i typically wear a 6 or 8 in dresses. the 6 fit across the chest but the armholes were large so wearing a bra would be a challenge. i am a 34c so i need some type of support. i also thought the fabric was a bit flimsy for the price. i am a huge retailer fan and usually leave glowing reviews but sadly i left this one in the store.,0
"I love this dress. however, it's not what i expected based off the pictures. 

the modeled photo indicates that it's a shirtdress with a drop waist. no. it's a smock dress with more of an a-line silhouette that begins at the shoulders. the waistline is more of a detail, like the button placket, than a structural quality. it's very youthful and whimsical. 

that said, it is quite beautiful. the fabric does not wrinkle easily, as another reviewer guessed. my daughter wrinkled it sitting on my",1
"Beautiful summery dress with bright fun print. i think this was well worth the sale price i paid. it lays nicely and is flattering. i went down a size from my normal 8 to a 6. however as other reviewers have said, the arm holes/halter top is too blousy and no matter how tight i tied it or type of bra i wore, you can see bra on the sides. i'm going to get this tailored and then it will be perfect. can't wait to wear this on my vacation!",1
"Well, i just love this dress. great material. beautiful coloring! perfect length! true to size.
i love the pleated neckline! i feel like an old hollywood beauty in this dress. great one retailer!",1
"But, it just doesn't measure up. first, the slip/lining comes unattached if pulled slightly and it is very difficult to actually get it on - either stepping into it or pulling it over your head. and, once on, the top was a big snug and there was too much material at the bottom which made it look really bulky. unfortunately, i am finding this to be the case with so many of the items i buy from retailer lately. the material is really cute, but the dress isn't worth the price / effort.",0

"I wish i had read more of the reviews....but thought i would give it a try. the shirt doesn't seem as long as on the model but the armpits are sewn to hit mid shirt. this would be ok if it was the length pictured, but since it isn't it makes you look very boxy. i don't know if i ordered a size too big or if it is just the way the shirt was made. wanted to love for fall.....unfortunately, i am taking back.",0
"Beautiful fabric and beautifully made, but the pockets ruin it... and i love pockets. you cannot see from the photos, but they protrude from the sides a few inches beyond the skirt, and look strange and unflattering, especially from the back. they are unfortunately placed right below the hips, and the effect is like those french bicycle baskets, ""panniers."" if they were smaller and in the front, the dress would work. i am usually a size 4 and both the 2 and the 4 fit me well ? not too snug or to",0
"I saw this dress online and really wanted to love it... unfortunately it wasn't at all as expected in person.

as the previous reviewer mentioned it is extremely itchy material, which was already pilling on many of the dresses displayed in the store. the neck was extremely tight; a problem i've never encountered with any retailer dress. additionally it seems to have a kangaroo pocket located right underneath the bust line, which protruded in an unflattering way. the pocket is not at all not",0

"I saw this dress on sale online and it was available at my local retailer. i tried it on and went with the xs, i'm 5'4 130lbs, 34c and it fit great with some room. tts the material is fabulous and it comes with a matching green slip which is great.",1
"Beautiful color, great quality! on sale too. a must have!",1
I was so excited to get this dress...i even paid expedited shipping! i read the reviews and thought that i ordered properly but i sadly disappointed. it was just too big. i'm a size 6-8 petite and the size 8 was overwhelming. the side of the dress were down to my stomach and i just can't wear the dress. not sure what to do but buyers be careful. pretty color and design but not well-designed.,0
"Loved the dress. loved the pattern and the cut. unfortunately it did not work for me. it is cut too low under the arm pits and therefore, showed too much breast. it is not made to wear a bra with either so that is not a solution. sticky boobs will not work either because it is the ""side breast"" that shows. i hated to have to send back but.....still looking for something similar and great!",0
"I ordered this dress, expecting a cool lightweight summer dress. i believe it says cotton in the description.however the material is a very heavy cotton-linen blend.would have much preferred a better quality fabric.the color is a nice green and is well made.it runs large, except in the bust which fit well.",0
I didn't notice this online but it caught my eye in the store. the colors are bright and beautiful. i wear a 10/12 or m/l. i tried the 12 but the bust was too big (i wear a 36c). i ordered the size 10 and it fits perfect. i'm so glad i saw it in the store. i think it makes much more of an impact in person than online.,1
"Ok, the material is great, light & airy. the thing they don't show you is the waist line is tucked in the photo, that's why you cant see the bi level hem line. the hem line is fantastic. the waist is the problem, the whole dress just hangs huge from bust down. the material is so light i would caution against darting the dress. i created a button loop cinch under the outside corer of the pockets, on the seem of the waist. this worked for me.",1
It seems this coat could have been manufactured under a smaller spec size because the size large looses shape and where it hits on the waistline is unflattering. quality is high however,0
I loved this dress when i saw it mostly for its emerald color. i am tan with brown hair and features so green is a good color for me. the quality is very high with detailed embroidery and thick fabric. the dress comes with a slip which fits well but i don't think you'd have to wear based on the opaqueness of the fabric. the dress fits true to size but the cut is gracious through the hips. this is a relaxed fitting. drop waist dress.,1
"I ordered xs petite. which they are sold out of. but in case you are a different size i wanted to write a review. i'm 5 feet tall and 120 lbs. i am 34  d so busty. the petite did not overwhelm me. the pockets do open. you're supposed to cut the little threads out. ask a dry cleaner or an retailer stylist for help. i like that there is a little ""stiffness"" to the cape. it has holes for your arms. not a poncho. your lucky if they have your size!",1
"Perfect denim top! the fabric/material is great and of good quality. there is a structure to the top, but it really makes the looks. the quality is amazing and the top can be styled in so many ways. for the quality, a definite must buy!",1
I love how feminine and interesting this top is. what i especially like is that you can layer different colored camis underneath to get a completely different look. the weight of the material makes it appropriate for all seasons. it is very well made and is something you can wear to work and also wear if you are going out afterward.,1
So much right but then....too short.,0
"This top is adorable in style and fit. which is why it breaks my heart that i can't recommend it. the embroidery snags so easily, when i wore it, i ended up with several tears in the threads, leaving the pattern a bit of a mess. it snagged on my rings, my watch and my purse. i returned it because of this. it's really too bad, and i wish the design were printed on instead of sewn, simply because it would last a lot longer.",0
"This shirt is gorgeous at first glance. the quality is there and it has a beautiful design...from the front, that is. but it is huge and billowy with back pleats. i cannot imagine this being flattering on anyone. it just adds so much volume to the top. i am thin and petite so maybe that was the issue, but i just can't see adding so much volume. this was a total miss for me. such a shame. would have been great without all the extra volume in back.",0
"Normally i like to purchase from the store so i can try things on first, but this top wasn't available locally. i guessed on a medium. i'm 5'5"" and very curvy and the medium fits just like the picture on the model. just a hint of a sleeve and nice and drapey-loose over the body. the embroidery is just beautiful. the only reason i'm not giving 5 stars for quality is that i had to sew two buttons onto the back, my top came without them.",1
This skirt is so cute. the fix print is really nice. it's a great piece to add to the fall wardrobe.,1
Such great detail great beautiful in red and white.,1
"This top is so cute and so comfy. i love the details, especially in the back. this embodies what i love about retailer clothing- the little unique touches that you find anywhere else. very pleased.",1
"I initially saw this top a few months ago, and fell in love. it ended up selling out in stores, so i ordered it online, where it was back-ordered by a couple of months. i received it this past week, and was sadly disappointed. the design is pretty, but overall the quality is sorely lacking. i wonder if maybe the first batch was good, but when they realized they were so popular, and had more made, the newer batches weren't as good? not sure. the one i got had inconsistent red embroidery, and ther",0
Hate i have to return it - way too long-almost more mid thigh/almost dress length.,0
"This is a beautiful top, the pattern reminds me very much of mola designs stitched in panama. i love the contrast of the red stitching against the white background. i'm not as crazy about the buttons on the back sides- not sure what that detail adds to the piece. it is a boxy shape, so be aware it's not going to hug the figure. the cotton is soft and medium weight. overall, it's a stand-out!",1
It's a cute top. i agree with the other poster that the neck in the front feels a little restrictive.,1
"Absolutely love this top! i've been on the lookout for a cute cotton top, something that'd be ideal for summertime. this beautiful piece doesn't disappoint. the color pairing - white cotton base and lovely red thread embroidery - looks stunning. not the mention the unique back detailing makes it a must-have. highly recommend.",1
"This has lovely embroidery of good quality, and it is nicely lined in the embroidered section too. it is a very loose swingy shape, so size down.",1
"I love this dress. it's beautiful and flattering. not to mention that it is also comfortable with a bit of stretch. i couldn't see it in the picture, but the black parts on the shoulders in front and on the back is sheer, so you have to be careful with underwear choice. i have an apple shape and yet this was flattering and the perfect length. i am short and apple-shaped and it was a great choice.",1
"I agree the light colored portion of dress is not vanilla; it is more beige color. i liked the dress a lot, it had a flattering fit on me, extremely comfortable and then i noticed the black mesh portion at top of dress. it did not lay flat at the outer sides between the mesh and floral fabrics like the picture. it poked out on both sides at least 1"" which suddenly made the dress look cheap and ill fitting. i can guess either the mesh pattern piece was not cut correctly or it was not sewn correct",1
"Cute skirt and print, but high waisted. also was more snug so think it runs a tad small. i wanted to tuck in a shirt like shown in picture, but it looks goofy because the waist is so high. also there is no flexibility there so size up if you want to wear it lower. the model's arms are covering her waist so hard to tell what proportion looks like on her. i'm 5'4 so might work better on a taller person. sending back.",1
"Based on previous reviews, i sized up to size 4 - i typically wear xs or s. while the length was okay, the body was way too wide! the neck was almost like a mock neck & higher than i expected which made it very uncomfortable for me! overall, i didn't find it flattering or anything special.",1
The embroidery on this was beautiful but didn't hang well on my athletic/small chested upper body.,0
"Gorgeous color, flowy fabric, unique design - this top is a winner. i don't even mind that i'll have to wear a strapless bra with it! a little bit on the larger size, but not too big in my opinion.",1
"Love this! saw online, didn't place the order and when i came back it was gone. retailer restocked so i got it second time around. ordered the red option. this shirt is beautiful! sometimes the online photos don't do the piece justice, but this time, it's even better in person. the embroidered detail is gorgeous, the fabric is light weight, and the back of the shirt has button down panels that are almost linen-like in look and feel. the fit is just as pictured imo. bringing this on vacation with m",1
"I recently bought this blouse, the soft fabric drapes nicely and the stitching is wonderful. love it!",1
"I am normally an xs or s in tanks, so ordered the size 6. looks pretty much on me as in the pic. love that it's a cotton denim but it doesn't have any stretch. love the look & the fabric, but the neck area feels slightly restrictive in the front & i think it wld creep up & pull on me when wearing. fabric is slightly stiff & the flared bottom just sticks out. armholes do cover the bra & length hits at the top of the hips on me. going to return the 6, but will try the 8 if the local store has it.",1
"The back of this top is very unique and the embroidery looked like it would hold up.
it does have a boxy shape, but it really works with this piece. i found it to run true to size compared to other pieces i have from retailer. for some reference, i'm 5'5"" and weigh 148lbs.",1
"These pants are amazingly soft and comfortable. they can be worn with cute flats and a dressier top/accessories to work or with a simple tee or tank with tennies for running errands or lounging around. these are great for multiple seasons. i'm 5'2 so they are a little long but the ruched ankle makes that look by ""by design"".",1
Really nice green blend of colors. fun style but not especially figure flattering as it is a very wide peplum. i still love it and goes with many outfits and as a fall jacket. is a bit itchy. need to wear sleeved top or dress underneath.,1
"I ordered the black 2 months ago, it was on back order, and i jsut received it finally. the fabric is super soft, itried on both xxs and xs and could keeo either one. the ""v"" in front where it crosses is low, so most people do need a cami underneath, but you could probably do without for ultra sexy look (not my style, but could be done). i plan on wearing this with skirts, deresses and slacks... i saw a commet on the lighter color, not sure, but love this one in black for sure@",1
I love this dress! it is equally pretty in person too. sometimes i will order things and when i get them the colors are totally different than what i anticipated. not with this dress. i love it and will get a lot of use out of it over the spring/summer.,1
"Sometimes i order things online that i can hardly wait to arrive, and then once they do, i wonder if i made a mistake when ordering it. this is one of those times, and it was not my mistake. the shirt i received is not like this one. it is an xs, but it is quite large falling inches below where this one hits on the model. everyone i have shown the shirt to says that it is a denim blue color, not grey at all. it is a pretty color, but not what i thought i was ordering. i hate it when this happens",0
"I wanted to love this top, but when i received the picture on the website is a dark charcoal almost black and the ""grey"" that you order is much, much lighter grey. in addition, this shirt is super boxy... thus why the model probably is pinning her elbows to her side to bring the top in. going back disappointed.",0
"This dress is so pretty; can be worn casually or with heels to dress up! i get so many compliments on it, and it's so comfortable, it's like wearing pajamas! i highly reccomend it.",1
"And the bottom looks like a tutu. first, i have high tolerance for scratchy fabric but this one i could feel it even through long sleeves. there is no way i could wear something that makes my skin itch so badly. second, the peplum part is huge and looks like an exaggerated skirt. finally, the color on the ""green one"" is darker than in the picture and it does have more of a green than blue tint. back it goes.",0
Cute but too thick and rough,0
"Given the price, i was pretty disappointed by the quality of the fabric. the dress falls nicely and fits well, but the fabric is cheap... i have another maxi dress that i bought for like 20 bucks at store on the boardwalk and it has the same fit and fabric. 
 
i expect a lot more from a dress with this price. i'd recommend only buying on super-sale.",0
"I can't get enough of this dress! this dress is everything. from the flattering fit, to the colors and pattern, to the design, and to the quality.. this dress really has it all. this is worth every penny and in my opinion, a great price for a versatile, high quality dress. the material is that super comfy, stretchy material which is perfect for everyday! it is a no brainer and easy to throw on. i'm so happy it comes in petite as the xsp length fits me perfect! it hits at the perfect length for a",1
"I probably should have gone with petite. this dress was just awful on. the waist was nowhere near where it was supposed to be. it hits me about thigh level. it's very unforgiving, clingy, and shows every bump. i found the material tolerable but if worn for long periods of time, i have a suspicion that it would begin to irritate my skin and be scratchy. it's going back.",0
"If you are going for a ridiculously high priced ugly sweater contest, this is the one for you. i normally like clothing with some character and juxtaposition, but this one did not do it for me. i cannot imagine the collar fitting right or flattering anyone, and the mixed layers end up making it look cheap rather than trendy.",0
"I love this sweater so much and wanted it to be my new favorite, but unfortunately it was a bit short for my longer torso. when i raised my arms up, it bunched up all wrong because it's a very thick sweater.",0
"I also returned this dress after waiting weeks to received it.  i had high hopes for this dress as i really loved it online but what a disappointment when i got it.  the fabric is made of cheap poly that's shiny, thin, and clingy.  it shows every lump and bump you have.  the zipper at the back won't lay flat and keeps bunching up creating an ugly bump.  the sewing and hemline is uneven.  there wasn't a lot of thought put in in the print placement where the seams was sewn together in the midline",0
"The top is indeed a bit boxier than i was expecting, as the other reviewer found. it still looks good tucked in if you're concerned about it. the fact that it's sustainably produced in ghana was a big part of my desire to keep it too. really great to see designers producing clothing responsibly! i wish that how a garment is manufactured is highlighted more on this site because it definitely contributes to my purchases.",1
"I really wanted to like this because the color is beautiful and the knit is obviously good quality. but the shape is impossible to work with. it doesn't just run big, it just hangs there. really disappointing. it'll have to go back.",0
"I love eva franco 
this is a very poor version ! bias seams are puckery... zipper is bubbled 
felt great looked like fun but too much if a mess to be fixed.",0
"I love this top so much online. i received it yesterday in the mail and unfortunately i am very disappointed.  there is nothing wrong with the quality but i do think it looks more appealing online. also, this top is probably not for anyone with a large chest. it looks nice and drapey on the model. when i put it on it just makes me look fat and the top (thanks to my 38dds) looks more like a swing top. i'm sure it's a lovely top on very thin people with a smaller chest.",0
"Do not buy this dress for full price. the design looks great but after receiving the dress, the material is made of extremely cheap slinky-ish polyester that you would find at a f21 store. the stitching is horrific and created an uneven ""hump"" on the back seam. just absolutely poor poor quality.",0
"I'm going on a cruise to the bahamas and when i saw this dress, i had to have it! i love it! it's soft to the touch and super fun to twirl around in! the seams are a bit awkward and that's due to the bottom part's shape. i have a slender navy blue belt that i pair it with to hide the waist seam and to accent my waist more. a navy blue sash/scarf/ribbon around the waist can do the trick too!",1
"I tried this sweater on in the store. i love the design and was hoping it would look as good on me as it does on the model. first off i should point out that the navy color in the featured photo looks much lighter than the sweater does in person. some of the photos accurately represent how dark the blue is (it almost looks black) but the featured photo shows it more like a medium navy. secondly, anyone looking to purchase should know it is very warm. if you are buying to wear mostly indoors you",0
"Picked this up in the store today, but didn't try it on first. it is even more gorgeous in person than the photo, but sadly this did not work for me when i got it home to try on. there is wonderful detailing, but somehow the bulky knit fit was just not flattering on. i think it is the thick knit and slightly shorter length. the knit was bulking up in all the wrong places and visually added about 10l bs to my frame. such a shame---really wanted to keep this beautiful sweater but it just did not l",0
I found this as a return in the store. i tried the xxs. i was so excited because it looked really cute on the hanger. it was so huge- looked like i was wearing an xl.,0
Fits well and appropriate for work or going out! love the pop of red in the beads! could easily be worn with a jacket well into fall! i typically wear a 6 and a small fit perfectly. not too short- but hits above the knee! this will get lots of wear!,1
"Really like the style/aesthetics of the top. it is very unique, and works with a variety of pants. the only downsides are that it flares out a bit more than it appears on the model, and it arrived somewhat wrinkled. i am 5' 6"" 125 pounds and i got a size 4. looking forward to wearing this a lot in the fall.",1
"This was the first suit i've ever ordered online and the first one piece i've tried since i was a very young girl, so i was a little skeptical going into this. i'm 5'9"", ~145 lbs, 34b, with a pear shape and short torso. i was pleasantly surprised by the overall fit--the length was right, the bottoms fit really well (i was nervous about the boy short/hip hugger design), and the suit was just very comfortable and cute. however, something about the cups just didn't work with my chest; my breasts di",1
"I don't usually go for swing style dresses as i am petite, but this one was totally cute. i like the color a lot, wasn't sure it would work as i am rather pale, but it is nice. the xs p was returned at my store, why i tried it on... winner. 115 lbs, 26.5 in waist, 30dd chest. i can see myself wearing this in summer, spring or fall (with boots).",1
"This swimsuit is super cute and retro. the ruching on the stomach is very flattering and the shaping on the padded cups makes for a very nice hourglass 1950s-inspired look. great for us ladies without a lot up top. i felt very marilyn monroe in this suit! i love the back coverage, too -- your butt doesn't hang out of the suit and the boyshort style offers a good amount of coverage without being dowdy.

i was worried about sizing when i first ordered it. based on what everyone said, i went with a",1
"I ordered in blue. so excited at arrival; it looked gorgeous...then i tried it on! i'm 5', 106#, 34d and my upper arms are a little muscular. i normally order 2p (sometimes 0p)...and never a problem. this top was sooo tight under the arms and at the upper arms...if i tried any movement would have probably ripped out the seams! maybe i just received a product that was mis-sized, or defective. all i can say, if you have skinny arms, you'll love it.",0
"Very cute dress, just way too big. i ordered it online, wish i would have gone a size smaller.",1
I love love this top.  it is so pretty!  i am stopped by strangers complimenting me on it. it is so flattering.  i wear a cami under it and find it perfect!  it hits at the perfect length below the waist on my jeans.  it's easy to throw on and go.  casual but dressy.  the sleeves do bell out so you may need to watch them when you eat.  i've accidentally caught them on my plate.  the shirts washes well.,1
"I'm 5' 5"", 150 lbs, 32dd, normally a 28p or 29p in pants. i ordered an 8 and probably should have gone with a 10. it was super unflattering?the print was overwhelming for my pale skin, it made my thin waist look larger than it really was, and rode up the inside of my thighs. i have a similar bathing suit from modcloth that's 1/3 of the price and 20x as flattering. if you have thick legs, this may not be the suit for you. i returned it--so fast.",0
"First off, this runs very large. i'm normally an 8 and sized down to the 6 but probably could have done a 4. it looked like a tent on me. the top part is lovely, i just think the bottom is way to large and not flattering. this one is definitely going back especially with all the white dress options they have out now.",0
"I got this top in white/rust and it is darling. the lining keeps it from being too see through. the bell sleeves add style without getting in the way thanks to the shorter length. i get many compliments each time i wear it. i am 5'1"", 103 lbs and take xs- fit was true to size.",1
I love the color and style of this dress. and i wanted to love it too? sadly the fabric is truly inferior to the retailer brand and definitely not worth the price of the dress. checked it out in store and so glad i did as it would have been returned for sure.,0
"The color and fit is amazing on this dress. i am 5""7 and went with the small and the length wasn't too short either.",1
"I saw this dress in the store, there are actually two different colors for this dress: one is blue/purple/silver, the other one is orange/tan/gold. both of them look very nice in person, especially with the shimmery thread. i tried on the blue/purple/silver one and i found it runs large. for reference, i am 5'2"", 34b, 120 lbs, usually wearing a size s or sp in retailer dresses, i found size xs fits me better in this design. the material of this dress drapes nicely, but it is kind of itchy,",1
Beautiful dress that is easy to just throw on and go. i bought both colors. though it is loose it is still flattering. it has a good length and movement. i'm normally a m/l or 10/12. i took a medium as it is pretty loose fit.,1
"I am a huge fan of tracy reese because her dresses are works of art, great quality, and super wearable for both work and play, and this is no exception. i purchased this dress in regular xs (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips) and it falls right above my knees. for the office or more conservative setting, i add a belt and a sweater. otherwise, i wear it alone for a carefree look. i chose the regular size because the dress is voluminous and it gets about an inch shorter when i belt it, and it looks",1
"I wanted to love this dress because the color is so amazing, but the arm holes are huge! i am petite and tried this on and it just sadly didn't work.",0
The dress runs large so if you go down a size you will be fine. looks awesome on. love it. would definitely recommend,1
"Great top. i bought it for my daughter and it is well made and the fabric is very nice. she is 5'4"" and it reaches just the top of her jeans.",1
"Love this top! however, i'm biased bc i love hd, such originality in their clothing, even in something as simple as a black tank top. also comes with the bra strap snaps, but i find my straps still show in the back, need to wear a strapless or criss cross. please note that the sides sort of rise up to meet the laces. so the more you tighten the laces, the more it comes up (hard to explain!). if you are at all even a little sensitive about a muffin top, again with low rise, it would show! still l",1
I love these shorts. i don't understand why they aren't sold out yet! they are buttery soft and fit great. i usually wear a size 26 and these are true to size. they are my go to run around shorts but because they are a dark wash so i feel like i can wear them out with a cute top to dinner even. love!!,1
"I love the material on these shorts. unfortunately, that's all i love. the fit is awkward and i'm an easy fit. they're boxy in the body / legs and a bit tight in the waist, causing me to not be sure whether to place the elastic waist higher or lower and neither one works well. sadly, couldn't keep these just for the pretty fabric.",0
"I am 5'0"" tall and i have decent legs. these shorts are pretty short! i am sending them back for a small to see if they'll give a little more coverage. i should mention that they are absolutely darling and i bought the top that is shown with them. it's going to be a great little summer outfit. the quality of this brand is always very good.",1
I love the pilcro serif legging jeans but these were a big disappointment. if you have any thigh at all don't bother.,0
This one didn't work for me. ordered this and the riverdeck tee as similar vein. riverdeck was cute and flattering cut. this one was boxy on me and didn't work. a bit too wide so sending back.,0
"I love this jacket. i'm 6' tall, 160lbs, 30"" waist and a 34d. i normally go for an 8/medium and i bought a medium. i love it! slightly cropped, barely snug fit but i can still snap it closed. totally warm enough for california fall/winter. i like that the sleeves don't have sherpa in them... make it easier to layer! i bought the ""silver"" corduroy and it's less white than the photos, but it still fits the bill perfectly. love that it's machine washable, too. it also has pockets!",1
"I was very excited to find this jumper in a store to try on. the small was huge (im 5'8, 130lbs), the xs was better but perhaps a bit short in the upper body, making it feel tight/stretched against my shoulders. i love the print and style, and would have bought it if it was $100 less. however, at the current price, it needs to fit perfectly, which sadly it did not.",0
"This is a pretty jump suit, true to size, looked flattering on me, lovely soft tencel like fabric and pretty design fabric. however, the sides are cut too deep and it's impossible to wear a strapless bra or any kind of bra without the bra showing. i tried without one and that definitely doesn't work, so back it went to the store.",1
Great bra. fits well. works under tighter t-shirts. just be aware that the straps do clearly read calvin klein. more mauve than pink.,1
"I can't say enough about this sweater! it light, delicate, soft, vintage chic........i could go on and on! buy it already!!!",1
"The skirt is comfortable and as pictured. it also ran tts. i'm 5'5"" tall and weigh 140 lbs. i had the medium and didn't need to size up to a large. when you put the skirt on a normal body, it looks like you are wearing an easter egg... and not in a good way.",0
"Like one of the previous reviewers, when my jacket arrived, it was not in the great dark wash pictured online. it was in a basic, medium denim wash. i like the wash pictured online; i did not like the wash the jacket came in. additionally, know that it is just huge. i ordered my usual size (medium) and understood that the jacket was meant to be roomy and swingy, but there is no way that one size down would be enough to compensate for how swimmingly large it was. i never tried an xs, but it was s",0
"I was very happy to receive this as a birthday gift. i usually wear an xs or s in clothes i buy from retailer. i was given this in a s, but it wasn't even close to meeting in the front, so i returned it for a m. it doesn't button anyway, but i didn't want it to look like it wouldn't meet at all. i tried on a size s sweater in this brand while i was in the store, and it fit perfectly, so this one is just running small. overall, i love the lace detail on the front and the softness of the sweater.",1
"If you like a slightly heavier, non/clingy basic tee, this is it. i wore the long sleeved version all fall and winter, rotating colors, and i've been wearing these with shorts and leggings since i got them. the colors are great, fabric is quality, and the ribbon detail in the back gives these a little flare.",1
"When i ordered this dress, i thought to myself ""hmm, it seems a little close to showing some side boob, but maybe that's just the angle of the photo."" flash forward to me trying it on in my home - ""yep, that's some side boob."" it is very low cut under the arms. if you're super slim, this might be a good look, but on a curvy gal with some boobs, it was obscene. also, i'm a solid 12 in most retailer brands, so i ordered a l and an xl just in case. the xl wouldn't even zip up. returning.",0
"This dress makes me so sad...the textured stretchy fabric, color, length, and overall swingy fit are spot on. as another reviewer noted though, the armholes and neck totally ruin the dress. the neck is tiny, which i could have gotten over once it was on, but the arm holes were just awful - too big all around (too tall of a cut plus too wide of a cut). basically, you could see my bra plus from the front there was unflattering exposure near the armholes. it could have been so good, but alas, but t",0
"There is simply a ton of fabric on this tee. i am a size 8 on top, with a fairly thin upper body but still an 8. at retailer i often order small for swingy tees, medium for more slim-cut. this tee in the small was huge. the shoulders fit well, but the body was so big and was a weirdly long length. just odd, especially for $78...",0
Loved this tee but embroidery started to unravel even before being washed. i paid full price for this top and wasn't disappointed but needed to return due to the embroidery problem. this tee is a mustard color.,1
"I have this tee in every single color and love it. this shirt is so soft, airy, and comfortable, and the ribbon embellishment on the back dresses it up a little. i love wearing leggings or skinny jeans with it and accessorizing with an infinity scarf. i normally wear a size small, but i sized up to a medium this time. there is very little difference in the two sizes, but i liked the modest increase in length. i'm glad that i did this, because the tees shrunk ever so slightly after being in the d",1
"This top is so pretty in the photos, but it just did not work out for me. it is more of a pale pink color than off-white like in the photo and it just hung on me weird. i felt like it was true to size, but made me feel very boxy. i can say it was very well made, so maybe i'm just not the right body type for it. for reference, i'm 5'5"" and 135lbs. the small fit perfectly, but was a bit too wide at the bottom for my taste. i was willing to spend the money if it would have been perfect, but i'll sa",0
"I would give this top a 4.5. it is a very pretty top, i love the embroidery, but runs a little short for my taste. it still meets past the top of my pants, but barely. this is why i didn't give this top a 5. i am 5'9"" so i think for a petite person the length would be perfect.",1
I saw this online and went to the store to try it on. so glad i did! it did not work on me at all! it is so wide - just did not look right. it was also not flattering at the neckline either. i thought it was beautiful until i had it on! too bad - wanted to love it!,0
"These are amazing quality. i agree, size up to not have such a sheer effect. i would not wear them as just leggings without a long shirt covering the butt.

they are warm. i wore them under some ski stuff. kept me warm.

i also washed them on handwash cycle. seemed to be ok.",1
"I love this top. of course i love most things that are denim, or look like denim. this is a fun twist on a denim shirt, the flutter sleeves and side panels make it different and eye catching. i have gotten so many compliments on it when i wear it! pairing this top with white or black pants or a skirt allows me to wear denim to work and still look professional.",1
"The dress is beautiful in pictures, but all the reviews are dead on...it was full of snags when it arrived! 8 snags to be exact. and the fabric was heavier than i expected. sadly, had to return.",0
"This vest looked so cute online but it's a disaster. the quilting is so bulky that the drawstring doesn't work properly and it just hangs. itlooks like something out of a costume closet that could be used for a peasant farmhand or a zombie movie. seriously, it's bad.",0
"I love the look and feel of the material, but it was way too short - i don't even have a long torso! sadly, it's going back to the store.",0
"The shape was not as nice on model, seemed like a lot of extra material.",0
This top is very wide and shorter than in appears in the picture. it also has a strong chemical smell. i've had a couple pieces with that smell in the past and the smell never washed out.,0
"It is an expensive panty, but so worth the money! it is so unique and flattering!",1
"I wanted to love this top. the neckline made it look strange on me. if i untied it, it looked sloppy. so, it went back. i love the print though.",0
I feel like a pessimist but then again nothings perfect. the only thing wrong with this stunning sweater is no button or snap so it just bags open. love it tho,1
"This sweater is beautiful! it fits/drapes nicely, is a gorgeous color, feels soft, and is comfortable to wear. i'm generally a s or m in this brand and opted for the medium. the sleeves are pretty long--i have to role them up a bit or they cover half my hand, but that's all right--they look fine rolled. i highly recommend!",1
"I would have loved this top if it were the length pictured on the model, but it was a cropped length on me :(",0
"I'm one of those people who is juuuust right between being regular and petite sized, so i have a hard time with some longer tunic styles. this tee is pretty fitted though the shoulders and bust, which makes the rest of the top kind of skim over the body. i like that, especially for those days where i feel a little bloated or like i want to hide out a bit. 

the fabric is very comfortable and not sheer. the little stripe down the back is a cute detail and it's in a slightly contrasting fabric w",1
The color and quality of these jeans is great. they were too large in my normal size. more of a boyfriend fit so size down.,1
"Sadly, this dress was trashed after wearing it for an hour. it snagged on everything -- my watch, my purse, my necklace. i had to go home, change, and return the dress later. impractical fabric ruined an otherwise lovely dress.",0
Can't wait to wear this out for the holidays! very comfortable and versatile - looks great with the vegan leather moto pilcro pants or any black skinny jeans for a more dressed up look -- i was originally going to pair with dark gray pilcro but the black moto with black heels looked really great in the store dressing room. beading is gorgeous and well done. velvet trim makes it luxe in my opinion. love that you don't need to pile on anything else to look polished -- top speaks volumes in and of,1
Too wide! the design is cute but the wideness of the overall piece and arms made me lose my shape. you can't see your figure underneath at all. i don't like pieces like that. this went back.,0
"Size 8 always, 36c and i have broad shoulders...i found this true to size. the colors pop more and there is a cleavage alert, just letting you girls know. this is very figure flattering, especially with my body frame, it accentuates the right spots.",1
"I thought that this dress would be perfect for my 60th birthday, however i was disappointed when i received it. it is extremely heavy from the beading and i just did not find it pretty in person. it did nothing for me. also, it runs small and was tight.",0
The shirt is great except for the arms!! the band around the arms are tight and it makes the arm holes gape weirdly unless you are standing with your arms straight down by your side.,0
"Like another reviewer said this was too baggy up top. the bottom length was good but arm holes were big and top was just too large. i'm 5'5"" 110 lbs and got xs. returned.",0
"Beautiful - ordered a s, i wear a 2 in most retailer items. hand washed in cold water, shrunk inches, yes inches! love maeve clothing, this shirt is gorgeous. before hand washing in the sink, it was large and flowy. now it barely fits.",0
The fabric of this vest is identical to a old white dish cloth! the cut of this vest is also bad! will be sent back!,0
"I love this jump suit.. sorta. looks great on but the dye rubs off on your skin. i washed it and its still happening. when you put your hand in your pockets, they come out blue, knees are blue, thighs, etc. i looked dirty by the end of the day. wish i could return it. fit and look great... not great after wear.",0
"The cut is too long and shapeless. if it was cropped, i would have kept it. the beads are delicate as another reviewer has said but i was prepared for that. too bad the fit just wasn't flattering. it's going back.",0
"This was a near miss for me. i love the concept of the asymmetrical shoulder cutouts and the contrast of the beadwork to the simple gray crewneck, however, with some of the beads bulging out about 1/4 inch from the shirt, i have to say it almost bordered on gawdy christmas sweater status... but still cool. i actually thought this piece felt fairly sturdy and well-made, but the thing that got me and led me to return it was that even in an xs it was indeed cut wide. if it were a little shorter it",0
"Customers beware, there is no lining on this dress. i love the pattern however it would be a nightmare trying to find a slip to match the dress! i ordered it on line but i'll take it back to the shop.",0
"Great fit, very soft fabric, and the sleeves are long enough!! great length in the body too.",1
I am normally a straightforward 10 - since i saw the other review i ordered down to an 8 - i am still swimming in it.i would say i have about 4 inches of extra fabric in the waist/hips. this is sized way too large. i love the softness of the checkers but i suspect this could get itchy fast on the arms where it touches the wool - but i won't find out cause i'm returning it?on the bright side i might fit a 6 which would be pretty nice.,0
"This skirt looks just like it does on the model. it is the prefect maxi skirt with lots of movement. i actually bought the off the shoulder top it is paired with. you can't tell on the model but the slit has buttons up it so you can undo or do as many of the buttons as you want to show off as much leg as you want. it is a little pricey,but well worth it.",1
"I ordered the cream colored duster after purchasing the grey one in store. i loved the grey one so much i had to get the other color. i love the length of the item. i am 5'9"" and don't feel like it is too short for me to get the look. it is light weight so i did not get too warm in it and will be able to wear it much of the year. i did wear it open as i feel that it runs a tad tight on the arms and torso when buttoned. however, i prefer the look of it worn open so that was not a problem for me.",1
I absolutely love this dress... tried it on one size down from my usual...it fit but my size would be perfect and 8 and 10 are out of stock. it's stunning and i love it... i badly have to have it... please bring it back retailer:),1
Great dress.  fitted but flowing.  i like the colors and think it will easily grams iron to fall.  i am 5 ft 32 d 27 waist.,1
"This is a gorgeous sweater with a great proportion in terms of length and fit. i am petite, so i worried that such a long sweater might look weird on me, but it actually makes me look slim and taller. i get so many compliments when i wear it. i ordered the xxs petite.",1
"They ripped on the inside upper thighs of both legs less than two months after purchase. i've washed them once, and wear them a few times a week, so they're certainly not worn out. i've never had a pair give out even close to this early. i loved the cut of the jeans and the softness, and they hold their shape well after multiple wearings. the color is lighter than pictured. i paid full price (the most i've ever paid for jeans) because i'd heard good things about jean shop quality. even at sale p",0
"I purchased the blue with white dots. the shape was awful, but looked like a sack - returned",0
"Tried this on in the red because the pattern is so eye catching and beautiful. i couldn't get it off fast enough. picture this: tight in the best, tight in the hips, extra billowy in the middle. so confused and can't see how this would be flattering on anyone. unless you're planning to repurpose the gorgeous fabric, skip.",0
"This dress has so much potential but doesn't make it.
i read all the reviews and very few were favorable and still took my chances. fabric color and textures is great but the design is really off.
with the little folds on the shoulder and since the fabric is more on the thick side, all this make it to accumulate the ""extra"" weight on the front of the body and as result ""not flattering"" for the majority of ladies including me
it is a shame since it has may great features, the style: flowy, low",0
"I was in love with the green print, so i ordered this despite the reviews. i wish i'd listened. the fit is incredibly weird--huge at the top but tapering in at the hips. so sad this didn't work.",0
I love all paige denim. i have the flared which i purchased in july and now the skinny. i got the zara ones last year which are a copy obviously and they are just not the same. the ones last year the paige sierra sold out fast but luckily these are here. i actually like these more because they are more worn looking. you can even wear a pretty top underneath to enhance them.,1
"I love the pattern (red motif) but the sizing of this dress is way off. the top fit fine but the hip area was so tight when standing with my legs hip-width apart. the only way it looked normal was if i stood with my feet together and thighs touching. i ordered my usual size 10 - for reference i am 5'9"", 170# bra size 34f and 40-41"" hips.",0
"For fuller busted folks, this top may not work as it's unstructured and results in a tent from the boobs down. it's a shame--i found the gold embellishment beautiful.",0
"I bought this in both the navy (a more saturated blue in person - gorgeous!) and green, but both are going back. it fit everywhere but in the upper arms, even across my chest, and i usually encounter the opposite. i think it might just be the way it's cut across the shoulders that don't allow for much movement. so, while beautiful and so incredibly soft, it has to go back. (if you have slender arms, i think it would be a great fit.)",1
"This is a cute item at a good price point, though the lack of lining in cartonnier items drives me batty. unfortunately, the wool is so itchy i could not tolerate it more than a second.",0
"Quality was not what you expect from retailer, especially for the price. top is lined but skirt is not. material is tissue paper thin and see thru. there is a point at the bottom of the sweetheart neckline that does not lay flat, it keeps popping up. however the back is very cute and for that i wanted to love it but too many negatives. was returned.",0
"I found the dot print in the store and though the pattern was cute, but when i tried it on i just had to wonder - who actually looks good in this style? it fits like a sack, big and puffy in the middle but tapered at the hem. it creates the exact opposite on an hourglass shape. genuinely puzzled that anyone would look good in this style. to bad, i hope they use these cute colors and prints on a style with some waist-definition next time.",0
I'm usually a maeve fan. i found this top to look cheap and fit poorly. it is also very thin material and showed everything.,0
"The cut of this piece is great, the quality of the fabric is terrible. i used it under another layer the first day i wore it and it pilled across the bust. after hand washing in cold water and hanging to dry it shrank in length- so much that i can no longer even wear it. i always happily pay a premium for quality staple wardrobe pieces. this didn't hold up to one wearing, let alone one season. i recommend strongly against it.",0
"These are very soft and fit well. at first i was a bit put off on the stone wash of the fabric; each pair is different. but it adds character and given the color and the soft fabric, it's a nice difference. i love the pockets, they are deep enough for anything you want to put into them. i love good deep pockets and my cell fits nice into my back pocket. take notice makers of woman's pants, there are some of us who *like* deep pockets!

only one negative... i have noticed hei-hei is not sewing",1
"I saw this dress in the store and absolutely fell in love with the fabric and just had to have it. i ordered it on line in my size and when it arrived, i tried it on (or tried to try it on) and it didn't fit some parts of my bday (mainly in the bust). i ordered the largest size, so there was no where to go from there except to send it back. others here have complained about a strange fit in the tummy area (i.e., too much material). i never got to find out because i really couldn't get the dress",0
"This dress was built for my body to disguise it's flaws. i did have to size up because i am broad shouldered, busty, with a tummy pooch and no hips. this dress skims along all that mess and makes me look slimmer. received the package today and am wearing it right now, i'm so happy! i ordered size 10, my stats are 5'3"" 145# 36dd.",1
This dress comes with a built in fupa. literally there is extra material at the lower abdomen that sticks out and is very unflattering.,0
"The first time i wore it, felt wonderful. had it cleaned and then the back end stated pilling. very disappointed with the price and quality. wish i could return for my money back. sad",0
"This is a beautiful dress, but the fit was strange. i have a small waist and larger hips. i generally wear a 0-2 in a fit & flare style, but styles like this i generally wear a 2-4 for my hips. even in a 4 this was catching on my hips and looked kind of dumpy on my top half.

i really think this dress would be great on a frame that had wider shoulders and smaller hips. it really is pretty.",0
"I saw this dress in the store months ago and never forgot it, so when i saw it on sale i nabbed it online. so sad to see how this dress fits: just right up top, just right along the hem, and then it's a hot, potato-sack-frump mess in the middle. it's a shame because the fabric is beautiful.",0
"As other reviews stated, this dress runs very large. it was a big potatoe sack on me. added to the fact that the green is much brighter than the online photos, it is going back!",0
"I purchased this blouse in the kelly green the other day and i love it. the color is beautiful and i like how it hangs/flows- especially the sleeves. it's not warm enough to wear by itself when it's really cold but would be beautiful layered with a cardigan in the winter months and by its own when it's warmer. looks great with skinny jeans, flares and just about anything including the right skirt. i'm so happy i purchased this!!",1
"I purchased this dress in the green, and while the print and material were lovely, the extra folds in the neckline made the dress look frumpy up top. the billowly bottom made it look like a bag. i am 5ft, 36d and 29"" waist and the size 2 fit, which makes me think this runs large! i'll be returning this dress.",0
"I really like this top. bought it in ""purple"" but i would not call it that. it is more maroon or burgundy. color is exactly what it shows in the online photo. really like the green also. crocheted arms are super. i found it ran slightly small, so if you are between sizes, order up. one slight personal problem for me is that there is cashmere in it and i live in florida. even though we do get cooler weather here, i am not sure i will have that much chance to wear it; it will be too warm for me. t",1
"I ordered this since it looked so cute on the model . when i it arrived, i was excited to try it on, but when i did...blah. the color is murky and the top runs large, not to mention that the material is too heavy for a short sleeved top (plus it's lined). i really wanted to like it and debated wetting it and then putting it in the dryer to shrink it a bit. in the end, i decided that it wasn't worth it. too bad, as the concept was a good one. it just failed in the execution.",0
"I got the orange dress and find it super comfortable and flattering. i dress it up with a one-inch taupe belt and taupe wedge shoes. it moves beautifully, i can wear a regular bra and it doesn't show. i got an xs regular and the hemline hits 6"" above my ankles. i'm 5' 3"", 33-26-35 and normally take a size 2 or 0. i'm long waisted, so often a petite will be short-waisted on me. the seam actually comes just below the bust line on me, unlike on the model. on days when i'm a bit bloated, i can wear",1
The way the back came down so much made the top look weird. i do like some tops that hang longer in the back but this one was just too much. also the material was kind of blah it was thick polyester which would not be very cool during the summer and the color looked better in the picture. so to me it was just a over priced odd top.,0
"I promised myself only one pair of joggers this year, and these were the ones i went with (in the blue motif). for me the tipping point was the quality and fit of these were far superior than the others i tried, while still being machine washable. the fabric has aa little substance, yet is still lightweight and comfortable. the fit has a perfect bit of tailoring/tapering to be ultra-flattering while having the comfort of pajama pants. the blue motif is adorable too - love the geometric shapes. l",1
I bought these in both colors. i'm usually an xs or a small and i went with the small for the length. they are a comfy shirt great for the hot summer days.,1
"I found the color to be a bit blah, and the sweater is chunky and is a tad too short for wear it lands. also, because of its ""chunkiness,"" it doesn't tuck in as nicely to a pair of jeans as it appears to on the model.",0
"I loved the look of this shirt, but when i put it on it was entirely too billowy under the chest. it just ended up making me look larger and pregnant.",0
"I saw the photo of the young woman wearing this dress in the reviews and she looked beautiful, i on the other hand looked awful. the fabric of the entire dress is quite stiff, so the dress didn't move with me; it sort of felt as if i was wearing a paper cut out. then to contribute to the volume, the sleeve is not set in, it is a raglan style, that on me looked more like a bat suit, than what i was hoping for, a beautiful distinctive dress for an important affair. also the belt didn't enhance the",0
"Love this top! has a beautiful shape, and it wasn't too long on my 5'3"" frame. puella always makes items with lovely, soft cotton, and this is no exception! awesome piece for summer!",1
"This dress didn't work for me for several reasons, but i knew i wouldn't keep it as soon as i saw the ribbing on the neck and arms, which makes an otherwise flexibly styled dress (dress up/dress down) into super casual only (plus it looks cheap). it is also not for the long waisted or tall.

on the plus side, the fabric feels great, and it hangs well.",0
"I hoped, from the picture, that this would be more of a ""straight down"" sort of fit. retailer is usually really great at selling tops that flatter hips without having an obvious bell shape to them. however, the top had too much of a ""flare out"" bell-shaped vibe. i need to be able to wear this with maxi skirts in the summer, but this top would be too sack-like and billowy with those. i think it would only work with jeans/trousers. my final objection was the arm holes - the way they are cut,",0
"Mine came smelling like gasoline. not sure why, but i would have kept it otherwise. it's a smell that will be really hard to get out. looks like the picture.",0
"Really enjoy this pullover's arm detail. i got the ""purple"" which was somewhere between aubergine and garnet. i think this will easily go with black pants to wear to work or a fun skirt/jeans.",1
"I purchased this top in the black and tan color, loved the fit, style and fabric. however, it is a loose weave and after just one wearing a hole opened up on the front, which could not be repaired. it was covered by the cowl neck collar but as the day wore on the hole got bagger and it can no longer be hidden. i was very disappointed in the quality of this top- i purchased it at full price and was only able to wear it once. i just didn't have the time to return it to the store.",0
"This is a heavy dress - it's surprising when you lift up the hanger how much it weighs because it looks like a light sundress. and on my frame, which is pretty thin, it hits my shoulders and then my hips and just falls... so the heft of it means there's no waistline... it's an odd fit. the color is gorgeous, but the lack of shape made this a no.",0
"I like the color blocking of this top, but it was too large and billowy on the bottom. it felt like a pregnancy top so i had to return it as it gave me no shape.",0
"First things first: these are not black and white as the photos suggest, they are beige and black, which was a disappointment when they arrived. i can still wear white shirts with them, but had they actually been b/w, i think they'd be more versatile in terms of possible shirt colors. that said, they are well-made, and the waistband and pocket detailing is nicely done. i love loose-fitting rayon pants and these are just that (mine fit a little looser than the model's fit). i ordered a small and",1
"This top has a lot of potential (comfortable, easy to wear) but it's cut too small in the area above the bust. i tried the top in small, medium and large (i usually wear s or m in retailer tops) and couldn't get that area to not look tight or like it was pulling. you can see it on the model, too -- that space right above the bra near the armhole. i think you'd need to order a size up to get that space to work but then the top will start to look too big on the bottom. 
i tried the green in the sto",0
These jeans fit well and the stretch makes them comfortable. i can't recommemd them though because they're see through. wish white jeans were better lined so that this isn't usually a problem!,0
"I thought this top was so cute but when i tried it on, it is so big on the bottom, it looks like a tent. i normally wear a l or xl and took it back to the store to try on a medium and that one fit better but the bottom was still too big. sad.",0
I loved the color of the top and the faded look but unfortunately had to return it because it was too boxy and just looked frumpy,0
These truly are tights and not leggings. they could not be worn alone but definitely great under skirts or dresses. they are thick and warm. i thought they ran a little big.,1
I love this top! it fits perfect and is of great quality! i ordered the pink and love it so much i'm getting the navy one! colors are so trendy as well. this top is so much cuter in person. hard to tell the detail online. definitely recommend to others!,1
"I read the previous reviews and ordered down a size knowing that the shirt runs big.   i really wanted to love the shirt however it was a tent. with all of the extra material in the back, it billowed out in all the wrong places. the material is comfy and it's a very cute concept, just didn't work for me.",0
Fit is just like stet in my opinion.,1
"The good: the sloths are cute because sloths are always cute. 

now the bad: the material is wretched. it feels damp even when it's not... it's see through and unlined... it's scratchy and wrinkly... and though the cut of the dress would be fine, the fabric is so limp that the high-low hem looks more like a tail. 

i wanted to like this, but charging nearly 200 dollars for a see through piece of awful fabric with a passable cut was simple not acceptable. i returned it as fast as i possibly c",0
"I have been stalking these pants since they first showed up on retailer's site. i have never even tried on anything like this before though, so have been waiting patiently for a review to get an idea of what they might look like, fit like...etc sale plus 30% off was incentive to take the plunge without a review though. i am wearing them right now and they are so comfortable and pretty and just...everything summer. perfect!!!! i am not a ""shorts"" person, generally wear skirts and dresses. these are",1
"I love the details and design of this top- my only issue is the top is a bit too ""flowy"".",1
"This dress is much cuter in person than it looks on the model online. it's so flattering, it fits like a dream, and i love the fabric. i love that the skirt is a true a-line, not poofy, so it's sleek, slimming and flattering. the neckline is feminine and gorgeous and is a bit sexy, while still being classy. oh, and the length, perfection! not too long, not too short. i never ever pay full price and for this dress i had to. i am a curvy size 4 and it fits perfectly true to size. i couldn't be hap",1
"This elegant-with-a-slight-edge top has a lovely neckline and is very comfortable. i chose the denim/blue version, which i wouldn't wear with jeans, but it's great with crops. i imagine it will be a good layering piece in the fall. it's long, but not long enough to be a dress. overall, it's flattering and slightly structured up top with tiny buttons at the back of the neck?generous and full below.",1
The stylist at my local retailer recommended i try this dress and it did not disappoint!  the material is fabulous and it looks exactly as pictured on the model.  it also has pockets which is a bonus to me.  i normally wear a 4 but bought a 6 in this dress - i am a 34c and i felt the 4 was a little tight across the chest - otherwise i feel the dress is pretty much true to size.,1
This top was supposed to be 23 1/4 inches long in petite. it's actually 28 1/2 inches long.  it's also large in width. hard to believe it's an extra small petite.,0
I paired this top with pants and cardi from retailer and have really enjoyed wearing this outfit. i usually wear a large but due to how much material there is and how flowy it is i sized down to a m and it fits perfectly. only down side is getting the buttons buttoned behind your neck.,1
Wide fit. usually an 8-10 at retailer. got a large for online order and was large for sure - great for summer or winter with long sleeve and tights,1
I live abroad where there is no retailer. so i  rely heavily on reviews.i took the advice from others and ordered a size up.  glad i did because the top portion of the dress runs very small. if you have larger breasts this dress may not work for you. luckily for me..it fits wonderfully..i love the fabric and the fact that it has pockets. it's lined..but not too bulky.its a lovely summer halter where you can show a little skin.,1
"This looks really cute online. i was super excited to get it and i ordered my regular size in maeve. i got a size 0 (i am 5'4, 114#). the top is very pretty and the fabric is nice but it is very short, it didn't even cover my stomach and didn't come to the top of my jeans. i'm sending it back. maeve usually runs big but you can't tell from the photo and the size chart that it's more of a crop top. disappointing since almost every size is sold out.",1
"This is really a gorgeous blouse. the design is very feminine and elegant, and fits true to size. i didn't think it ran short and the material is light and airy. it sold out so quickly so i had to wait awhile and managed to get my hands on a 4 when it was available for a quick second. it was def. worth the wait. a gorgeous top.",1
"This dress has been in my inbox for a long time and when it went on sale i purchased it right away. i am a size 4 petite in everything retailer and have not had a problem with fit, if anything i might have to size down. i purchased a 4 petite in this dress and i couldn't zip it all the way up. it was as if i was trying to get into a 0 petite.  i don't even think a size 6 would fit. there is something not right with the make of this particular dress i received. even if the fit was perfect i didn't",0
This shirt is way too flowy and the pink color is extremely washed out- will definitely be returning!,0
These white jeans are super cute. the longer length is perfect for tall ladies who can still roll them up. you can also adjust the height of the cuff since it is not pre-attached to the jeans. i will wear them all the time.,1
"This is just the cutest dress on. i love the way the plaid comes together in the seams and the fullness of the skirt. i almost didn't order it, but then i left something in my cart too long and it was gone. this was my next choice. i haven't had the chance to wear it yet. but the wrinkles pressed out beautifully and it is hanging in my closet waiting for an event. i will wear it without a bra since even with my strapless, the bra shows in the front. i think if you want to wear a bra it would be",1
"This tank is great - goes well with black pants of skirt. it's a nice texture that doesn't show too many wrinkles so will travel well. it's a bit hard to get the buttons done in the back of the neck, but i assume that will get easier with time.",1
"Another lovely, billowy top. i tried on the xsp and the bottom was just huge. and i have a huge bottom - haha! it flowed out so far in the back that it looked silly. it's too bad, because from the waist up, it looks great!",1
"Cutest dress i own. very flattering, makes your waist look tiny.",1
"So, i really like the plaid designs by siyu. i saw these pants and questioned whether they would be tight and scratchy and ill fitting, but they were so cute, i had to find out. i'm really glad i did. the wool is soft and actually a little stretchy. it has an elastic waist, which is a plus, because sometimes, even if the legs fit, the waist is too small, or vice versa. i am a large, and very curvy on the bottom, and these are perfect and flattering, and the elastic waist is just right. as on the",1
"This is a nice dress made with high quality fabric. unfortunately i'll need to make a return as it was quite big. i bought this dress in an xs and it was too large all around. i am about 5'3"" and 112 lbs and would have taken the petite, but there were none available. i'm not sure the petite would have even been small enough. the dress was a bit too long for short ladies and definitely too large in the waist and the bust (i'm small on top). it's too bad a this was a cute, and versatile dress that",0
"I love the relaxed flattering fit of these pants but the navy die runs..a lot. the first time i washed them t did so per instructions on the label. i did my next load of laundry and everything turned blue/ grey! i tried washing them again with vinegar to set the color and hopefully that will help. lots of color running still though, so to be safe wash and then run washer with nothing in it to clean it before doing more laundry. i'm keeping them because i like the pants, but wanted to let you kno",1
"I agree with another reviewer who said to get these while you can. the fish print is adorable! and you can't beat the style and uniqueness for this price. i am 5'6"", 145 lbs with long legs and a thicker waist. normally wear size 8 in pants and purchased these in size small. i would definitely recommend sizing down. the mediums fit me ok but the small was more flattering overall while still being roomy and having lots of flow. can't wait to wear these!!",1

dressed up or down, they always look good, they hang beautifully, and their ease & comfort make them my go to staple in this southern heat!",1
"I admit i have a soft spot for a most anything from maeve. this dress is no exception. i had overlooked it online due to the white shirt they show with it online. but the material, design tex are great. the colors are very me and i can see this being a great fall, winter and early spring dress. the material is very soft ( i have sensitive skin) and i love the little pop of color that the front piece adds. the only draw back for me is the lack of pockets and it runs big. i got this on sale so siz",1
"Great style and cut, love the deep v. the fabric is soft and its very comfortable. it gives some support. i don't wear it with light blouses or shirts, unless i'm hanging around the house. i have this is pink and black.",1
"This dress fit me like a glove and it's very pretty on, but the fabric looks and feels very cheap in person. it didn't look like a dress i spent this much money on. the lining is a very silky thick polyester that doesn't seem like it would be comfortable in any sort of heat. the lace overlay has this strange fusing kind of material between the pattern that looks so cheap. i love the idea of this dress, but it just isn't worth the money (in my opinion) so i returned it.",0
I purchased the sand color (beige/) one size up from my usual xs to allow for extra room around the hips. the dress fit a little large so the extra room wasn't necessary. the fabric was much thinner than i expected for the price point. the dress was sheer and on my lighter skin tone looked more like a lab coat than a dress. this may be stunning on someone a bit taller. at 5'4 it just hung on my frame and didn't do much for me. the pockets are a nice touch but overall the cut was unflattering and,0
This blouse is so cute...casual but still stylish. the problem was that is is a little short for someone with a long torso and it is almost too revealing...the v is so plunging you would have to either pin it our wear a cami. the beads on the ties on the sleeves are also rather heavy and they swing and roll around on your arm...maybe wouldn't bother some but it was a return for me.,0
"So comfortable! i wore it during my last airline travel day, and a complete stranger complimented me on it.",1

"I was so in love with these when i saw them online. they arrived today, and while the fit was great, i was disappointed. the colors are definitely more drab in person than what's pictured in the photo. the material is very thick. it's soft and they'd be warm in cold weather, i'm sure. i liked them, but they were underwhelming. if they were less expensive, i would probably keep them because i liked the fit and they'd be a quirky alternative to what i usually wear to work, but sadly, back they go.",0
Cute dress...but akward fit. sleeves are a bit sung but the rest of the dress is a little large for its size.,0
I thought it would be heavier than it is. it's thin and more delicate than what i would expect for a winter sweater (it contains wool so not really suitable for spring/summer). it's also shorter than it appears on the model and a little wider/boxier too.,0
"The front and back of this square sweater are the same, and the pattern of the stitching makes it look like it's on backwards.the lace would be nice, but it's itchy. and the sweater is cropped, so i think the layered lace look is odd because the whole thing is so short on the body. the 3/4 sleeves make it look small and fitted, but the body shape is bulky. just couldn't get it to work.",0
"1. the wide leg/crop is a cool trend. but not great on me. i'm pretty standard in size/build: 5'6"", 135 lbs,, size 4. i felt like i just looked oddly shaped with them on.
2. and maybe this is the issue: the size 27 (my normal size in every citizen pant i own) was about 2 whole sizes too big for me. i mean, i felt great about myself. but...wowza.
3. when i took them to the store to try on/exchange, they don't even carry them in the store! so i just returned and will try something else.",0
"These are not only comfortable, but so cute. they are something you don't see on everyone else, and people always comment. i get so many compliments or inquiries every time i have them on. the materiel is lightweight and flowing. i love these casual, beautiful beach pants. i got a small, my usual size and they fit great. 5'3'"", 130 lb.s. i wear tee shirts, bathing tops, coobies, any kind of top looks swell. get them while you can. i got the peach and black color.",1
"The fabric is very thin. i have seen this comment on several sundry reviews, but its hard to imagine how thin the fabric is until you see it in person. i could put a cami under it - but it was also rather short on me. i don't usually have trouble with shirts running short and can even sometimes wear petite sizes since i am only 5'4"".",0
"I have a dress very like this from retailer's fall line.  i love it, so i decided to try this one. the fabric is thinner than the other dress, which is good for spring, but it also seemed not such a great quality. i also didn't care for the texture. if this doesn't bother you, the pattern is very cute and the style is flattering. it is cute with a blazer.",0
This was an impulse purchase for me. a year ago i would have never considered a jumpsuit but they are growing on me. i had yet to find one that fit without too much need for tailoring. this one did the trick! i like that the cut is in such a way that you can wear a normal bra underneath it without it showing. the fabric itself is very lightweight so i would recommend a bra for some support. i like that the fabric is incredibly lightweight so you can wear it on a hot summer day. the jumpsuit is l,1
"Great print, terrible quality. the material is paper thin. not at all what i look for in a robe. it's going back.",0
I was really hoping this dress would work because it looks adorable on the model. i ordered my usual size 0 but when i put it on the cross part in the front was way too high on my neck and was super uncomfortable. i also had a lot of room in the back of the dress so it wasn't as form fitting as i would have liked. i ended up returning this dress.,0
"This shirt is amazing! the soft fabric, detailed embroidery, and gorgeous little beads/sequins..all fabulous quality and make this piece worth the price. i love the length and cut of this too - not boxy, yet not too tight or fitted; just covers my bum. can be dressed up or down.",1
"I hope you can get this top.this is a great classic,that will be in my closet for a long time.",1
This dress is really stunning - can be dressed up or down with a jean jacket really easily. runs quite a bit small in the bust (i ordered a 16 to accommodate) but it is really very pretty. i love this brand- they always have such lovely pieces.,1
"I'm a big fan of left of center as a brand, and this top is definitely a winner!  the deep green is gorgeous and looks fantastic with denim. the shirt is true to size and is flatteringly loose without looking too tent-like. highly recommend!",1
"This dress is gorgeous! i absolutely love the embroidery. a note about the sizing- while the top portion fits snugly, the hip section runs slightly big. i was surprised to find that the 4 i ordered looked baggy, so i went into the store to try a 2, but the 0 was the best fit! however i'm small-chested (and 5'6"" 113lbs), so i was able to go with the 0 as it fit the hips much better. if you're a bustier type though, the top may be tight. other than the tricky sizing, it's perfect.",1
"Purchased this dress to wear to new orleans in may...perfect with sandals for casual and dinner. so sad that it was not as i had hoped. the fabric is a bit heavy, and the sleeves are very tight (i have thin arms). the color is a bit ""off,"" as the background color is a gray, which doesn't flatter the yellow design. i purchased the large, as this size usually fits me with a bit of flow, but it was very tight all around, especially around the bust area. going to have to return this...",0
"Makes me feel like a sexy ice skater. true to size, i am 5'0 and 120 lb and both the small and medium fit. i kept the medium. love it!",1
Bought this dress for an indian wedding- it was perfect!,1
"The top is just as shown in the picture and it is tts. lots of detailing with beads and lace. i'm 5'1, 92lbs and purchased a petite 00. just as the other reviewers noted, the side slits do come high. high waisted jeans or leggings works perfectly.",1
"I have looked at this dress a dozen times online and passed. after reading other reviews felt compelled to see why everyone is in love with this dress. when i opened the box i was blown away. this dress is so beautiful and the crystals, which look like sequence online are high quality, as is the fabric and craftsmanship.
a perfect 10!!!!!!!!!!!!
you must have this dress in your closet!!!!!!!
ordered my usual size and fits perfect.",1
This sweater is very pretty. i had my concerns being that i don't normally pay $300.00 for a sweater but i found the material to be extremely high quality and the details really make it a beautiful piece. i literally got a little tired of people telling me all day how pretty it was. this is definitely a piece of clothing i will cherish for years to come.,1
"This dress is unusual. it can be dressed up with wedges and dressed down with cool sneakers. if you have any under arm excess fat it will show...but you can hide it with a cropped cardigan. i am 5' 1"", 105 pounds, lean athletic frame with a 32b bust and it fit well and snug.i bought an xxs. i am relatively lean under the under arm but this dress does show any flaw in this area and it does not look good. minus point. super cute and made well. i wear it with a cardigan.",1
"I loved the look of this shirt but full price was a little steep so i waited for it to go on sale and am glad i waited because only a l was left and it was perfect fit since i originally was thinkng of getting a small or medium which i usually do at retailer but this one was running really small compared to retailer other shirts. the fabric is great but when i looked at it carefully, the zipper construction is sewn poorly as well as the sewing at the buttons area...also, there were a lot of thread h",0
The details and colors are exquisite. stop hesitating and get this dress,1
"My daughter tried on this shirt in new york & loved it so i ordered it for her for christmas1 i am thrilled, & she will be thrilled! love my purchase!",1
"Such a gorgeous top, the detail and fit are amazing. however, after wearing the top for about 8 hours, 7 of the center rinestones fell off. the beads on the sleeves also snagged the embroidery where the sleeve touches the body. but, i love the top so much, i exchanged it for another and hoping i have better luck with quality this time around.",1
"Beautiful piece that i loved from the day i received it in the mail. lots of compliments, just a fun, pretty outfit.",1
"I love this t-shirt - the moss green color is just what i wanted, cute fit and true to size. purchased the medium b/c i like t-shirts to be a little loose.",1
"I was quite surprised to find the background color of this dress was grey,not the stone/linen that i was expecting. it still works beautifully against the citrus. fits true to size; the 3/4 sleeves are slightly narrow around the forearm but not tight. i'm 5'4, fairly slim, 132 and i'm in the process of exchanging the petite m for a regular medium as it was just a bit too short for me. i'm very short waisted/long legs, so the straight design is perfect for eliminating the issue. i also found no p",1
This shirt is gorgeous. i bought it for my engagement party and got lots of compliments. the only thing negative was that the particular shirt i bought had one of the stones on the sleeve that the prongs were bent so it snagged the beautiful embroidery on the front of the shirt.. of course my local retailer exchanged it for a perfect new one without hassle. it's an expensive shirt but perfect for a special occasion.,1
"Saw this in the store, looked at the price tag and decided to wait for a sale. got it this weekend with the 20% off and love it! (thanks retailer) wore it for my birthday dinner and received a ton of compliments. as someone else noted, it does catch on itself so take care when wearing. also, the slits on the side are semi-high but as my husband noted, this makes it a touch sexy instead of just a tunic. i went with an 8 for this reason(you could also wear a tank underneath). and yes, even on sale,",1
"I love the weight and drape of this vest; it adds a finished touch to even the simplest t shirts. i plan on wearing it into the cooler months of fall. however, it runs a week bit small across the bust. i normally wear a medium at retailer but large would have been a better fit. sadly the large vest in the dark blue was sold out.",1
"I received this top by mail yesterday and opened it this morning. all i can say is wow. it's gorgeous. the detailing is stunning, classic retailer amazing. a true standout piece. can't wait to wear.",1
"I ordered size medium. the fit is true to size. the color and pattern work beautifully with the delicate yarns and design of this sweater. as other reviewers have stated, it is very thin and lightweight. in my opinion, it serves more as an accessory rather than it being functional as a cardigan worn for warmth. when i tried it on, i considered whether it would provide any warmth at all...summertime air conditioning, etc. the answer is no... if i decide to keep it, it will be for its aesthetic...",1
"The fit is a bit loose in the body (more than you can tell on the model) - more like a true swing style top. i feel the arms are a good fit, but i ordered one size up from my normal since i'm planning to wear this as a maternity top. arms are definitely a size smaller than the body. the ruffles at the bottom are a bit odd, but overall i still like it. the cutout notch at the collar is super cute! plus, the green color of this top is lovely and i love that it's made in the usa so i'll be keeping",1
A must have sweater with great details. it can be a star piece with leather tights or very long flare jeans. i recommend platform booties for perfect body proportion.,1
"I was able to get this on sale. when it arrived, it was missing half of the rhinestones. i am very surprised that this top would be sent out this way. it also was missing the little bag with extra stones. i'm reaching out and wondering if anyone else has experienced this and is there a store that sells rhinestones like the one on the blouse? any help from anyone would be appreciated. i hate to part with this, but where was quality control?",0
I love this blouse! the details are beautiful and and it is so versatile! i can where it with jeans and boots or slim black pants and strappy sandals and get tons of compliments every time. one of my favorite retailer purchases ever!,1
"I ordered my usually size, xs, and it's just so wide and unflattering. looks like i'm wearing a tent. i don't understand why tops anymore are either huge or skin tight. why not something in between?!  the pink color is really pretty and the details are nice but it's just blah in terms of the fit.",0
"High quality, yummy soft fabric, gorgeous color. even with those three pros, this jumpsuit is not for me. i am 5'2"" and 150 lbs, size 10-12 m/l in the lines that retailer carries. i own one of their jumpers and it is very flattering! this one, however has capri pants, hits awkwardly at the midsection and makes my torso look even more square. on a tall, thin woman, it probably works!",0
Great color and quality but very boxy. even with the drawstring there is no shape going on here.,0
"I love designs that are flowy/drapey in the front, so this hits the mark when tied in the back. has lots of visual interest. but i agree with the other reviewers.. the slip is super small. dress fits true to size, if not a bit large but the slip is one full size smaller. and you must wear a slip. overall, i'm pleased with the look.",1
"This product is awesome! i'm a tall lady with wide calves and thighs and these socks look and feel fantastic on me; they are tight enough that they don't wind up sliding down around my ankles, but not so snug that they make my legs look like sausages. i would recommend this product to all of my girlfriends.",1
"This dress did end up working out for me. however i am very narrow in my chest and shoulders and i can see how it would be too tight on anyone with a med-lrg chest and/or broad shoulders. the fabric is light weight, nice for summer. it will need to be ironed and will wrinkle easily but it still looks well made to me. the slip is smaller than the dress but i feel that the dress is supposed to be ""drapey"". i kept it.",0
"I'm liking this jumpsuit, it's not love but it's definitely a like. i typically avoid the elevenses brand since it never seems to fit right but i gave this a try. i usually take a l in other retailer brands but sized up to xl in this and it was a good choice. first off, the material is awesome, super soft and drapey. but i agree with another reviewer who mentioned the zipper being short and it being tough to get into. i found that to be right on, makes it a little hard to get your arms through the",1
"This jacket is totally adorable. i wore it with a man tailored shirt with the color up and the sleeves poking out.
it has a great swing to it and is very comfortable! it is sized perfectly. and i got it on sale!!!",1
"I love the idea of this top.  i had reservations when i ordered it d/t the large armholes but i envisioned wearing my cute cropped pilcro jean jacket with it.  it turned out to be a disappointment.  the armholes are gigantic and the sweater itself did not fit as on the model.  the front was much shorter and wider and basically stuck out from my body.  for reference, i ordered the xxsp.  sizing up might have lengthened the front but would have exacerbated the armhole problem.",0
"This top has a beautiful pattern, and the color is gorgeous - just like the photo. it is very thin, but under a sweater or blazer in the fall/winter would be perfect. it is a little big! i would order a size down.",1
"I wore this sweater last weekend and received so many compliments. not only is this a very pretty style, the poncho is comfortable. i really glad i purchased.",1
"The navy blue lines on my dress on the very top of the interior layer can be seen through the upper layer at the very top and it looks cheap. for this price, i would expect more thoughtful patterning. the fit is amazing, so i am debating whether i should keep or return.",0
"Adorable! great for yoga or everyday use. can even fit a strapless bra under with no showing(i purchased the black). i'm 5'4"", usually a 6-8 and it fit great.",1
"Loved this top, but had to return it. the collar is gorgeous but terrible quality",0
"I ordered this in xs and it fits loosely (i am 5'3"" and about 120 lbs). this looks great with skinny jeans or leggings and shows off the long necklaces that are in style right now. the chiffon doesn't lie perfectly along the side seam, but i'm sure only i notice.",1
This is so beautiful and looks hand made but in a really good professional way. this will be a perfect fall wardrobe addition and i can't wait to wear it with a long sleeve top and jeans and boots. it's not too long and it is very flattering and soft and drapes well. love it.,1
"This immediately caught my eye in the neutral pattern, and the fabric is actually quite nice. the fit is at least a size or two too large though, with the bust being way too large for me even sizing down. my normal 4 was big everywhere, and the 2 was still big in the chest, but fit everywhere else. the belt is handy for cinching in some of the loose areas, but the top section just didn't work for me. maybe better for someone better endowed?",0
"I was on the fence about this dress because even on the model, it's a little bit frumpy, but it was so pretty that i tried it. however, on my short frame, it's even frumpier. the quality is very good, the fabric is soft and it's lined. the pattern is really pretty and delicate and i wish it was more flattering. i think the only way this dress will look good is if you are quite tall and thin. i am 5'4"", 110 lbs with large-ish hips and i ordered a 2p, but even the petite was too saggy. i needed a",0
I had hoped this blouse would be white - but it is cream in color. it was also more boxy than i thought it would be. i am usually a 4 or a 6 and went with the 6. a size 4 would be a better fit.,0
"This dress is very soft and ultra comfortable. i got a size 10 and probably could have gotten away with an 8 but due to being busty on top stuck with the 10. i love the length ,even though i got the regular and not the petite.",1
"I wanted to love this dress. i am not comfortable wearing dresses much above the knee and i liked the length and the way this looks on the model. however, in person this dress is cut like a sack. it is not tapered at all in the waist and there is just too much fabric when you cinch the belt, at least on me. it was oddly shapeless, even with the belt. it seemed a size too large. i ordered the xxsp. for reference i am 5'1"" and 107 lbs. i ordered the neutral dress and i really like the fabric and c",0
"I honestly don't understand whey this top isn't sold out. i have it in both colors and love it! it's a cool, gauzy woven fabric, super soft and perfect for warm weather. the white fabric is doubled so it's not see-through, the pink (more of a pale terracotta) is doubled halfway up, so it's slightly sheer on top but your pants/skirt waistband will not show through. it is a loose-fitting top, so you may be able to size down. i usually wear size 4p, but it was sold out so i got regular size 2 and i",1
"This dress (i ordered the ivory) is stunning. it is fully lined, the belt adds a needed accent, and the print on the fabric is gorgeous. the fit, though, is another issue. i typically wear a 2-4 depending on the cut and fabric of dresses, and am pretty proportionate with my hips/bust. i ordered a 2 in this dress. it was enormous on the top and painfully tight on my hips and thighs. the fabric has absolutely no give - it needs to drape perfect or it looks awful. if you have any type of hip, thigh",0
"Ordered this in white, thought would be really cute. but didn't like, and returned it. i am big busted and it was unflattering teh way it draped.",0
I love this top! nice lightweight material but not too sheer. runs a little big and may be slightly too boxy for some people; for me it was perfect.,1
This is my first time purchasing a bra from this brand and i am in love. the style and quality are amazing. it is the most comfortable bra i owned to date and i will be buying more from this line. it provides a lift without all of the uncomfortable padding which requires continuous adjusting. i am saying goodbye to vs forever. i got this in red and the bra looks more expensive than it actually is and the fit is simply amazing.it is sexy and classic at the same time.,1
"I tried this blouse on in the store. i'm generally an 8 or 10 in this brand. i got down to a size 4 and gave up. this blouse is huge all the way around. the detail on the blouse is pretty, but the tent like cut made it impossible for me to buy it. i know retailers blouses can be swingy and flows but this went way beyond. perhaps on a tall person the swing would work but on a short person like myself...i looked ridiculous.",0
This top is too boxy and has too much going on. it should have no buttons or different ones.,0
"The color and fabric of this item are so appealing and i think this is a great piece for the right person. the fabric is beautiful but also much thicker than i'd imagined from the photos. it has a quilted quality so doesn't drape very well and is just too much fabric for me around the arms. i typically wear a size 12 and ordered the large. i think a medium might have been better. haven't decided yet whether to exchange for m or just plain return. has an artsy, cool professor vibe that i like.",1
"This is such an easy dress to wear and it looks very polished! it is not a ""cheap polyester"" fabric as one reviewer wrote. it is a rayon and nylon blend. it does wrinkle easily. i love that the belt is actually sewn into the dress at the back. i don't typically gravitate toward warm color palette, but the burnt orange color is really lovely. it can be dressed up or down very easily. and it has pockets! i typically wear xs in retailer brands, and the size 0 fit me well.",1
I found this while shopping at my local retailer and loved it. i was able to size down from my normal 10 to a 6. i got the warm white and it's lovely - couldn't wait to wear it. the detail is so pretty and love the buttons and 3/4 length sleeves - i am thrilled! i couldn't be happier!,1
"The material is soft and the pattern is pretty, but it fits like a sack. it's too bad that this wasn't more form-fitting, with some stretch and a zipper, because its fit is just not beautiful. for tall, very slender ladies, this will be pretty, as it is in the photo. it fit me just fine (with a little extra room on top), but it went right back into the bag without a thought.",0
"My personal opinion is that i am not a fan of this top, the material of the fabric doesn't seem as nice as delettas other tops and it had a really boxy fit on me. i wanted to love this top but i did not.",0
"Overall, the dress is beautiful, easy, and great quality. but the bottom part has more fabric than it appears in the photo, if that makes sense. it's not poofy or super-layered, but i had to pinch fabric on a part of the dress in order for it to have that more straight/shift shape that you see online here. besides that bottom part, the fit is true to size. but as a petit, the extra fabric isn't what i'm looking for.
i think it works depending on what you're looking for. beautiful though!",1
"Not as cute as photos, and too small in chest. i am 5'5'', 125 lbs, and the small was too tight in the chest, and i am not large here at all. shoulders and sleeve length fit well. will return. not comfortable, and will need to be able to button it on rainy days.",0
"These are my favorite jeans i've bought in the past year! they're the perfect length for booties, i love the rise, and the denim feels amazing- so soft. mine haven't stretched more than a normal jean (in fact they may have stretched less than others i've had), and i can wear then multiple times before washing with their shape being in tact.",1
"I ordered not one but two sizes of this dress to try on and was hoping to ultimately wear to an event - one 00 petite, one 00. the style, color and cut are all perfect. one not so minor downfall, however. the zippers on both dresses were faulty - they both broke in the same spot, both during the first time just trying them on. i can't get either of them to even budge now - will either need to take back or get fixed. very sad about this.",0
"I've been wearing these shorts for years, i work outside and it was great to have comfortable jean shorts that were just the perfect length. the fabric quality on these shorts (and many many other retailer items) has gone down. sure, they're great when you try them on in the store..soft, comfortable, flattering, but when these are worn for a day they get so stretched out that i feel like i need a belt to keep them on. i wore these several times, sat down on a relatively smooth concrete wall, and a",0
"This skirt is beautiful. fabric is gorgeous,with perfect amount of shine and luxury to it. there is a ""life ""in this skirt; it is well made and follows the body lines in a perfect way. or,i better say, it did fit me perfectly first ten minutes of wearing it. unfortunately, it stretched more than a full size, and generally lost its shape. now, the skirt is two sizes too large and not really wearable anymore.",0
"Too much of a good thing is...still too much. there's too much flounce on this jacket for me--the waist sits slightly high, and the incredible amount of fabric beneath it (when you twill around, it's basically a full circle) makes my hips look huge. if there were about 1/3rd (not 1/2, but 1/3) the amount of fabric to the skirt, i'd be totally in love. 
as it is, i'll be returning it.",0
"I had been eyeing this coat for a few weeks after it appeared in the email, and i finally decided to purchase it to treat myself. i was very excited to get it, as it is a beautiful coat online. however, once i received it i was very disappointed. the material is much thinner than i would expect for something that cost $168, and when i went to button it the button slipped right off the thread it was sewn onto the coat with. i checked the other buttons and all of them were loose as well.

"I had to size up to a medium because otherwise my boobs would not get along well with that button down front, but once that was taken care of i really loved the silhouette this created. the belted waist flatters an hourglass shape nicely. perfect for sipping tea and eating finger pastries like a fancy little lady. i have no idea what i'm going to do when the time comes to wash it though... we'll cross that road when we come to it, i guess. also - the interior seams are a bright, electric blue -",1
"The pictures do not do this skirt justice! it is reminiscent of the vintage mexican circle skirts with a pretty lace design. the fabric is nice and light and it is a lot of fun to wear.

it is definitely one to consider washing by hand. i put mine in a lingerie bag and washed it on the gentle cycle, but the bottom edge of the lace frayed a bit. it is nothing a pair of scissors can't fix, but to avoid any further damage, i will be washing it by hand in the future!",1
"This was sold out in an xs when i first saw the email. i ended up seeing in my local retailer store and tried on my usual xs. i am 5'3"" with a longer torso and about 108 pounds. my chest size is 32c and the xs was just too tight. it buttoned up beautifully and the length was as it is on the model, even though i am much shorter. however, when i tried to move my arms, the jacket constricted all movement. this is a huge disappointment and i imagine going to be an issue for many girls who order online",1
"Love the way this dress looks online. sadly, it doesn't look great on me. i'm 5'4"", athletic build. the small fit perfectly, but the extra fabric in the hip/pocket area just seemed to drag me down. i really wished this worked for me, but i think you've gotta be a little bit taller to pull this one off.",0
"I purchased this in-store in a vivid red color, but didn't try it on until i got home. big mistake! literally the first time i tried to zip the dress, the cheap, horrible zipper noted in previous reviews just...broke. midway up, right under the waist tie. i was trapped in the dress for a good 15 minutes and was scared i'd have to rip or cut the fabric to get out of it; eventually i pulled the zipper apart to escape. can't wait to return this asap.",0
"Pilcro stet roll ups are my fave! i have about 5 or 6 pairs and i needed a replacement for my light wash so i went in the store and tried these on. wow has the quality changed. the denim is a lot lighter in material, now, the wash isn't as real, almost like i'm wearing jegging shorts. these were my favorite but now i'll have to look for light wash denim shorts elsewhere because these new ones just wont cut it anymore! why, pilcro?? the sizing is about the same, they run a little large due to the",0
"I fell in love with this trench when i first saw it online but ended up returning it once i tried it on. i'm 5'9, 140 lbs and the m fit true to size. but the belt hit above my natural waistline and the skirt of the coat was much fuller than i expected, making me look heavier. the material also wrinkles easily and the stitching was poor quality with lots of loose threads. disappointed, as the color and concept were great.",0
"This trench is beautiful, with a lovely, swinging skirt that adds a romantic sense of drama and movement - you'll feel as though you are starring in your very own film noir movie. i wish i could have kept it, but i couldn't justify paying full price on a coat that had to be hand-washed (the label specifies no dry cleaning!).there is a lot of fabric on this trench, and i imagine that all those little pleats will have to be ironed too. i don't have the time for that, and for this much money, i wou",0
"I love the bright red color and also the texture of fabric. it's light, soft and crisp, which is perfect for summer days. the dress is definitely designed for people with a short torso. the waste line is a bit high for me, but overall it didn't feel weird or look funny. there is just something about this dress that made me very difficult to part with. once i tried it on, i had to bring it home with me!",1
"I just loved this when i saw it in store. beautiful fabric, lovely color. i ordered a small petite because petite xs was sold out. i imagine it might be a little better if it were a size smaller, but there is sooo much fabric in the pleated bottom, unless you are blessed with exceptionally long legs, it might end up looking like a witches coat. at least that is what i was told by my daughter.",0
"The cut and color of the dress is awesome. however, the biggest flaw is the zipper. i only got to wear this dress once until the zipper broke..sad day especially at the price. there also were a number of loose threads. i recommend waiting until it goes on sale. you'll want the extra money for a tailor to fix that zipper.",0
"I'm usually a 12, or size l in retailer and when i tried this on, buttoning it up from the bottom, i was so excited...until i reached the chest. it was way too tight in the bust and i am not that big in that area - it was painfully tight on my 38d chest. it's also unlined, which makes it not very useful for anything other than the warmest times of year. it's a shame because the skirt is swishy, and a good length - many trenches are too short, or not wide enough on the bottom for a fuller figure. i",0
"Nice material, hits high waisted, mine was a return that was not repacked and was just balled in the bag and was so wrinkled that even if it looked good, you couldn't tell. very disappointed to have it arrive in that condition-so not typical of retailer.",0

Shorts don't fit me like they did the first time and i've only worn them twice! the material isn't what is use to be. it stretches out to fast. i don't think i will be buying these again. wish i could take them back.,0
"The skirt on this trench has tons of fabric. it goes on and on, and drapes and twirls beautifully. as a trench, it fits well and does the trick. i believe the skirt is heavy enough not to blow around too much, but i haven't been out in extremely strong winds yet. it fits true to size, at the knee (i'm 5'5""). i sized up because i assumed i would be layering it over clothes. my regular size fit fine over a lightweight cardigan.",1
"I love maeve dresses and have always gotten a lot of wear out of them while still looking great. this dress does not meet those standards. on the 2nd wear of this dress the zipper completely broke. i had to take it to a dry cleaner to get replaced at a pricey cost for a pricey dress, i'm dissapointed.",0
This coat is absolutely beautiful. the fabric is soft and almost silky and the style is timeless. i ordered an xs and it fits true to size and has excellent quality.,1
"I love maeve dresses but there are several issues with this one (for my taste). 1) the fabric and color closely resembles my medical scrubs, 2) the zipper is cheap and barely goes up or down, even when it's just on the hanger. 3) the bow is really cute but doesn't make up for the other shortcomings.",0
"I usually wear a s petite so that's what i initially got in this. i'm 5'2"", 32c-27-36. the shoulders were about an inch too wide on either side, the sides along the top had tons of extra fabric (almost like batwings or a dolman cut) and the waist was at least 6"" too big! i'm re-ordering in petite xs and hoping for the best, because this is a gorgeous coat.",1
"Wow, this runs small! i'm thinking the accidentally sent me an xxs?!?",0
This product has a terrible zipper that ultimately caused me to return the dress. it's pretty bad when it won't even zip up on the hanger. such a beautiful dress; it broke my heart!,0
So happy this came back into stock! beautiful trench! love the flared skirt. the coat is perfect for the warming weather here on the east coast. it adds elegance and sophistication to any outfit. a must!,1
"It's a perfectly cute simple summer dress, but the only reason i'm even considering keeping it is because it was a gift. the material is fine but for this price, i expect something more exciting than what is, really, just a modified t-shirt dress. at least more exciting colors or a print or something. the top piece is 2 full layers which could get warm in the summer, and the ribbing is tight enough that you have to wear a bra even if you're small-chested (i'm a 32b and super thin and still neede",0
"Tried it on in store and found it cute and comfortable, it might run a little big since i was expecting to fit into small but found the xs fit and looked better. i will consider when on sale. i felt that it was way over priced.however if money is no issue i would buy it.",1
"I knew i needed to buy this trench from the moment i saw it on my computer screen, but something prompted me to stop by my local retailer and try it on first. thank goodness for that.

at first glance, i knew i wouldn't be buying this. the construction leaves much to be desired. from the flimsy, single layer of unlined, unstructured fabric, to the thin strip of fabric serving as a belt, i could easily see this being sold at a cheap store for teenage girls where throwaway clothes are a dim",0
"Darling jacket/coat, similar styling as the beige with big flowers and lace-up back that i bought a few years ago and still love. i was considering this one, but the description says to hand wash. seriously? a coat? that's simply not practical. not sure if i will buy this one.",0
"Got this style in both black and green. the fabric is soft and the neck design is very elegant! i am 5'3, 120lbs, 34dd bra and take this in size small.",1
"Once i saw this trench coat i thought it was so cute! i'm usually a small in retailer tops but can be a little broad so i decided to go with the medium (based on other reviews). when i received the coat, it was a little tight in the shoulders but still doable. i was surprised how thin it was (just a single sheet of cloth) and how full the skirt bottom was (however, there is a cute light blue seem lining inside). overall this trench coat is not really a warm coat, but more of a fun piece to dress u",1
I really wanted to love this sweater after reading the reviews but when i received it i was sadly disappointed. it is pretty boxy and not much shape. could be cute for casual outfits but i was looking for some dressier sweaters.,0
This is a beautiful top but the xs was literally 4-6 inches too wide. very disappointing! i am thin and tall but this was a maternity top on me. i don't usually wear xxs. it is much more voluminous than it appears in the picture and it is definitely gray and blue not white.,0
"I wanted to love this coat so bad. the material is lovely and it's beautiful on the hanger but being tall and skinny is a must to pull it off. if you have any hips forget it (my hips are 38"")- you end up looking incredibly bottom heavy. the jacket also ran funny across the shoulders....like the underarm was sewn low down the arm so arm movement was restricted, it was weird. but it buttoned nicely without any pulling so it wasn't a size thing. i bought a size medium, at 5'5"" and 140 pounds.",0
"It goes without saying that trenches are timeless. but this one broke the mold with its femininity in the flare and the (finally!) different color. i saw this and put it in my cart, debated, and went back a few days later (as i always end up doing, because i could not live without it) and it was no longer available! i was devastated and could have kicked myself. but i waited a bit longer, went back on the website and thank god - retailer had ordered more from the designer and had replenished stock",1
"The color is as pictured. good quality. it's lined. the zipper in the back makes it look updated. i ordered my usual size. small petite size 6. it fit perfectly. i'm 5 feet and 120 lbs. hourglass figure. i had high hopes. i have hips and short, heavy legs. the skirt only emphasized my flaws. if you've got great legs you will do well with this. i do own other short skirts. but the fact that is less tailored in look makes it better suited for a younger gal. if you're on the fence give it a try. it",0
"I ordered this dress online in order to get a petite size and am very disappointed. as other reviewers have mentioned, the fabric overlay is very different in person than it appears in the online pictures. the dress is much more casual and looks cheaply made in person. 
as for sizing, i ordered the 2p based on other reviewers' comments about it running small. the 2p fit me fine, although it was very fitted in the chest and i am very small chested #32b#. i can definitely see that being an issue",0
"This tee is super comfortable. it feels and looks like a well worn favorite right off the rack. although it only comes in s-m-l sizes and i wear an xs ( 32a/b, 105 lbs) the small fits well. no gaping armhoes to worry about. the pics don't show that the tee does trapeze out somewhat but it is not to worry about. i purchased the reddish color which is a wonderful faded maroon shade. i will be getting the black one as well.",1
I'm so in love with this skirt. i sized up to a 4 (i'm typically a 2 in maeve) and it's pure perfection. i had to steam it after getting home from the store because it wrinkled up pretty quickly. wore it with my copper birks and a chambray top but i can see this being dressed up for work as well. took off a star due to his easily it wrinkled.,1
"I love this shirt. it's different than other summer tops. it's pretty much as pictured in terms of color and size, and runs true to size. on a windy day the front will come open, but only to your stomach.",1
"The dress is pretty, i ordered a 4 and 6 not knowing how it ran, i took both back the neck is too tight!",0
"The length of this dress is bizarre.  i can't decide if it's supposed to lay on the floor or not touch it at all - i'm not sure if i like it either way.  also- at this price point, i would have hoped to have the included under layer to not be so transparent.  if you buy this dress, be prepared to invest in a slip and then have the slip tailored to match the high low hem line so that people cannot see your underwear.  the netting and details in this dress are beautiful but delicate- the one i pur",0
"I feel in love with the dress when i saw it hanging at the store. usually, i feel bailey 44 dresses make my body look really round and short. i've passed up a few because i didn't find them too flattering. i almost even just passed this one up because of my past experiences, but i tried it on and felt like i had the body of another person! it hugged my body very nicely and i felt like it gave me a shape! i also saw all the possibilities it had. the store had it styled with a denim jacket. i can",1
"So i haven't actually tried this and i'm sorry for the misleading star rating. i just wanted to get someone's attention on the length. the photos show the dress draping with almost a train even with the model in platform heels but in the video, the dress is about 2 inches off the floor. is it the model in the video that is extra tall? someone help me out. this looks gorgeous but since it's an online exclusive, i won't be able to try it on at the store.",1
"This dress is stunning, no doubt - a shimmering forest green under a black teardrop motif, thick material, nicely cut, with pocket panels that are forgiving to a belly. however, the fact that this dress has zero stretch (which is fine, if that's what you're looking for), coupled with what is quite possibly the cheapest zipper ever manufactured, make this dress exhausting to put on. i'm normally a 14/16 at retailer, and i ordered the 16 just to be safe, and the waist is exactly the size of my waist",1
"I read the other reviews on this skirt and tried the 4 and the 6 (i'm between the two sizes, typically) in case it ran small. technically it does. the 4 is tighter, but it looks better sitting higher on my waist. the 6 is looser, but doesn't look as good. likely sticking with the 4. the colors are gorgeous and the fabric is light and high quality. it can be dressed up or down.",1
"I ordered this dress to possibly wear to my wedding rehearsal dinner. i an adding this review to give some guidance on sizing. i am size 34a and own two other dresses by this designer in size 2. for this dress, however, i had to size up to a 4 in order to close the side zip. i'm 5'7"" and the dress hit me just above the knee. (in my opinion, it would have been more elegant if it was a little longer.) the color combo with the taupe and off white is unique, but wasn't particularly flattering on my",1
I love this dress's gentle blue lace. the silhouette is just as seen in the pictures. i found the dress tight in the chest and had to size up one size (6 to 8).,1
"I wore this top right out of the package i loved it so much. i am 5'8"" small busted and size 4 was great. the sleeves hit me perfectly. the pleated detail in the back is flattering as well. my daughter now wants her own top. it would be nice to have a second color option.",1
Top opens in the middle right in front. should have some sort of closure inside to prevent this top from flying open will return,0
"The dress at first glance is pretty, feminine, and a timeless shape. sadly the quality just isn't there.  i ordered online and was excited trying it on (dress fit true to size for me, all be it a little snug in the chest).  the zipper is super cheap, hard to get up or down on or off the hanger.  the appliquã©s are sewn onto a super flimsy netting, already coming detached without even having worn it.  i could see this dress catching on ""everything"" and tearing easily.  given the quality i'm return",0
"I wanted to love this dress, but it has too many flaws. first, the ""waistband"" falls right under the bust and the skirt flares out from there. not a flattering silhouette.. second, the fabric is a sickly yellow-beige netting that looks like burlap. third, i can't imagine what kind of bra you can wear under it. on the plus side, the fabric isn't scratchy.",0
"In the photo, this looks like a heavy knit top, but it's not. the fabric is very light, thin, and soft. it's like a knit nightgown material. i said this runs big b ecause i'm normally a size xl and i can wear this. it actually fits me a little less flowy than on the model and i think looks better. so, to me, you can size down if you want this not to have so much flowing fabric.

the front criss-crosses over and it will stay together at the top area with movement. the two fabric pieces sort of",1
"This dress is so short! i double checked to make sure i didn't get a petite by mistake.  i'm 5'10 and ordered an extra small because of the deep v neck. it fit well on top, but  you could see my underwear in the front. seriously, i dont even think miley cirus would wear it that short. the lace was really beautiful so i was disappointed that it didn't work out.",0
I wanted to love this top -- looks so comfy and cute. but hangs like a bag. going back!,0
"I knew the ivory color was online only so i tried the blue one for size and i couldn't believe how nice the blue one is. i ended up buying it. i purchased a size bigger because mine wasn't available but because of lace and side zip, it still doesn't look huge. if i find my size in another store i can always exchange, but i couldn't leave the dress behind.",1
"This cozy sweater has the feel of cashmere. it fits loose and has a similar look as a wrap or poncho. looks better over sleeveless or short sleeve tops. i'm surprised it isn't one size fits all b/c it is very generous in the xs/s, which i got and i'm a 6. i can see wearing this all year long, even summer cool nights. very classic style. the picture on website looks frumpy to me, but on it is very flattering.",1
"First i found the picture of this blouse stunning because the colors caught my attention . with that said, i found myself thinking of all the many events this could worn to, dressed up or down. so.... i found myself ordering it asap, paranoid that others were thinking i was thinking the same thing. well , i received it in the mail , and it was better than i thought!!! the colors and cut of this blouse is just as in the picture. i personally love this article/pattern of art, as i see it as an exp",1
"I love everything about this sweater. it is very well made, beautiful material and such an effortless way to pull it all together. it runs large which was unfortunate for me as i bought the xs petite and i really need xxs in this one, but none are left. i am 5 ft. tall and weigh about 96 pounds. i can wear a 0 but not in this sweater. it runs very well and i highly recommend it. hope they make more in this style. it is so fresh looking and so comfortable.",1
"I love the look and feel of these shorts - typically my issue with any sort of cotton or linen shorts these days is that they're practically made of nothing, but these are comfortable and made of decent fabric. however, they run very large. being 100 lbs and about 5', i typically buy size 0 or xs, but these looked a bit ridiculous on me, with how big they are. i tried shrinking them in the wash, since they're 100% cotton, and that helped some, along with getting rid of the creases from shipping",1
"I love any bow tie tops but most have the bow too high up which looks dowdy. i love the layered look and the contrasting colors. i am 100 lbs, 5'3"" and got the regular xs. i wanted the petite xs but it was sold out unfortunately. the regular was a little too big but it still works! looks great with jeans or dress pants....even a skirt! very versatile and classy and creative styling.",1
"The sweater is comfortable and has a little 70s fabric flair...not quite as classically modern as it looks on the model. i am keeping it because it is a true fall/spring item. not a fabric weight for summer wear in california. the peach color is pretty muted, so it is not a show-stopping going-out piece.",1
"Looks great on the model, but if you're curvy it looks very frumpy.",0
"This is a beautiful dress with so many interesting textures and colors. it is form-fitting yet modest enough to wear for so many occasions - i plan to wear it for my son's graduation, but i think there are many potential uses for this dress. be aware that, like many byron lars sheath dresses, the bottom part is very tight- makes it hard to fit for more pear-shaped people. the top is a tad loose on me while the bottom is quite snug. however if i go up or down a size it will be too big on top or t",1

"Bypassed this blouse online, but it's striking colors caught my eye at the store. bought the olive green color and it's gorgeous! the color is great for both spring and fall. i'm normally a petite xs at 5'0 feet and 104 pounds, the regular xs is a great fit for me. not too boxy and the length hits right at my waist. material is lighweight and flowey. don't hesitate to buy, it's a great piece to add some pop of color and goes great with skinny jeans..",1
"This shirt is not awful but not anything pretty. there's a reason the main photo has the model with her arms crossed over the waist! it runs good on top and then you get to the body of the garment and it runs straight down yet the pleats even make it manage to expand a little but then you get to the lovely detailed hem which reins them in. so now you are left with a bit of a poof effect making you rounder in all the wrong ways. it's one of those, ""i'm too lazy to send it back it's not that awful",0
I bought this in red and wear it a lot. it is so soft and comfortable! i love all the fabric and the design. the longer sleeve length is amazing! it is a perfect tee! you can tell from the pics there's a lot a fabric and it's supposed to be loose and drape like that. it fits like in the pics and is true to size. wear a tank underneath in case there's a strong wind.,1
"This blouse is quite stiff. i wouldn't mind the boxiness if this blouse weren't so long. even if you size down, because of the eyelet and the cute hem, it would be difficult to shorten this blouse to fit.",0
I get that it's a swing style top and supposed to be loose but it looked so much bigger on me than on the model and just not flattering at all.,0
"This top is crazy in the front and just way-off when it comes to a cross-over drape. the top did not lay flat and the drape over has one snap which seemed to ""bloop"" open constantly. the bottom in the front is a strange combination of layers that i couldn't get to look good.

i'm busty, but this isn't the reason this blouse is just a disaster of a fit on me. the blouse fits tts and everything was covered, so it's not like it was too small and tugged. that's not the case. this blouse just didn't",0
"Normally wear a medium in most retailer tops (5'9"", 150lbs).  would probably need an xl to fit more like a tunic.  right now, in the medium, fits more like a tiny shirt, but more for fitting.  arms are also tighter than i expected.  will be returning.",0
"Love this top. yes it is a swing top so you have to be prepared for the extra fabric. fits true to size thru the shoulders and chest. body of the top then flares for the ""swing"" effect. great top. plan on ordering it in the other colors.",1
"If you're pregnant, congratulations. this shirt is for you. if you've ever dreamed of being an xxs, this shirt is also for you. i'm a 34d, normally a small or medium, but often size down to xs in swing tops. the xs is ginormous on me, although it fits through the shoulders. i can hold onto the bottom and stretch my arms straight out at the sides, it's that wide. think flying squirrel. what doesn't show in the pictures is that it also has a slight dolman sleeve, which makes it look wide at the to",0
Didn't like the dress. look pregnant in it. this dress is going back.,0
"This is the perfect cool day, cozy, teacher sort of sweater or if you're having a mr rogers sort of day. the material is soft and comfortable and the color is just as it appears in the photo. looks great with a button down shirt underneath.",1
"Maybe i just have the wrong body type for these jeans, but even though they technically fit, i felt like they looked like ""mom jeans"" on me. i was fine with the high waist, which actually made them very comfortable, but the ankles were loose and long on me, where most ag ankle jeans are a perfect length. the quality is good though--the fabric is substantial and a bit stiffer than most of my other ag's, and the color is a nice saturated black. i tried on a size 27, and i'm 5'4"", 120 lbs.",0
"I was stoked to get this dress, and it is truly beautiful, but the fit is so awful. it was like being swallowed up by a bag. i ordered my usual size 6; i'm 5'7"" 140 lbs, and a bra size 34dd, but the dress just fell on me like a sack. i was so disappointed!! had to return.",0
"The fit of this top on me was much more boxy than on the model, maybe the fault of my fuller bust. my usual small definitely didn't reach my hips as it does hers, and appears wider. i'm not even sure the v is as deep! again, could be me. but i'm keeping the top because it is just so darn comfortable. as for not looking too top-heavy, ill just have to make it work.",0
"I love the contemporary style of this piece, but i returned it because the side slits were too high even for a short person like me (5'1""). but if you don't mind showing a little skin at the waist when you raise your arms, it might work for you. the fabric has a nice texture and the muted colors would mix well with other pieces.",1
Beautiful dress. when you look at it on the hanger you think this could be really good or really bad. but it is absolutely beautiful. would highly recommend it - can dress it up or down.,1
"Very comfy with cotton and lots of stretch. can be dressed up or down. i wear it with blue denim jacket and also with cream cardi. 5'4"" 135# and the small is perfect.",1
"I have been continually disappointed in retailer's clothing for the past year. i feel like their prices have soared and the quality has remained so-so, but dresses like these somehow make the cut. it does not make sense. since when did retailer exclusively market to older women? no, retailer's market has always been young adults. this dress is extremely matronly. although the bottom print is nice, the hot pink belt?? is completely mismatched and gaudy. i really hope retailer starts curating better dress",0
I ordered this in black and in the print and i am super happy with both. the fabric is very soft. i've worn it with denim and khaki shorts as well as with a cute skirt for work. very versatile.,1

"I usually find maeve to run tts, but i sized down in this. i am normally a 6p and got an xs regular (to make the length more work-appropriate). i think a larger size emphasized the extra room at the front tucks - making it look a little maternity-like.

it is very flattering on - drapes nicely. i got the cranberry color for the holidays and will wear in with wine tights and light taupe over the knee suede boots!",1
Looks so beautiful.... on a hanger. does not really do anything on a person. beautiful beading but the dress on is very sack-like. i will be returning it,0
The photos do not do this dress justice. i loved it as soon as i tried it on! it is good quality and the fabric is not too thin. definitely recommend!,1
"This top is pretty and i'm sad it didn't work out for me. i'm 5'9, 145 lbs and i found it to be short and boxy in the torso (tried on a s, m and l). also material in the front is super staticky - i hate that feeling.",0
"These are thicker and don't have as much stretch, needed to go up from my usual 26 to a 27. good for late summer to fall transition due to the wash.",1

"I love the look and fabric of this skirt. it also falls at a very nice, flattering length around the knee. what did not work for me was the waist. the stretchy waist looked cheap, and i do not have a flat stomach, so it made me look like i have a muffin top! i bet it would look great if you have a flat stomach.",0
"This dress by dolan is my go to favorite for work. it gives a polished look with a pair of booties.i purchased it in an xs. i'm 5'1 and c-d cup. fit me perfectly. i can't wait to team it up with a sweater for chillier fall days. you will get a ton of compliments with this dress. love, love , love.",1
This shirt ran small and was more sheer than i expected. had to send it back.,0
"Like the idea of this longer tee/tunic to wear with leggings but i found it not flowly enough in my regular retailer size ( small). fit on top but not really on the bottom with the side slits. unflattering how the slits hit me. maybe for some one taller ( i am 5'3"").",0
"I have an hourglass shape, so this skirt is winner for me. classic a-line fit but with a modern hem. it's subtly shiny, very stylish, and comfortable. paired with a tight shirt and heels it looks extremely sexy. a sale price makes it all the sweeter.",1
I love this dress! it's so comfortable and perfect for the summer fall transition. it fits true to size and isn't to boxy or tight. i love the colors as well!,1
"I can't believe how small this thing runs. beyond small. it's almost insulting because the dress is just so gorgeous you really want it to work, but there's no way it's going to when the l is actually a s. so sad to return this beauty.",0
"Was excited to try this interesting skirt, as a mega bailey 44 fan. however, this skirt didn't fit well. the waist was fine but it then was boxy and shapeless on me in an xs/size 0. my piece also had a wrinkle from folding and i'm not sure how it would easily come out but the main thing is that the lines weren't flattering to the body. the ""vegan"" quilting isn't luxurious. i thought the diagonal zipper style was cool but it doesn't lay to advantage when worn and i'm an easy fit. length is so-so,",0
This skirt fits in a strange way. there is one pleated area but it is on the side so it is not flattering and i kept feeling as if i wanted to straighten the skirt.. the elastic looks frumpy. unflattering.,0

"Spied this dress in my local retailer and figured i would try it on for overall fit before ordering the petite on line. for some reason retailer has eliminated in-store petite items (so disappointing). i was pleasantly surprised the xs regular fit well and was soon in my checkout pile. the dress is very soft although i suspect it will wrinkle when packed in a suitcase. the color blocking is great and makes this dress so versatile for spring, summer and fall. the xs regular fit my 5'1"" 115 lb",1

"This is such a lovely dress -- and it looks great on! like other customers, i like the petal hem and the top part, which is stretchy, is soft and not clingy.
 
i think the only drawback is that the color isn't as rich a green as it looks in the pic. i've attached a pic for comparison and contrast purposes.

i'll be wearing this way into the fall!",1
"This dress is great! the fit is perfect and very flattering. the two colors and asymmetrical hem on the front make it different than you average sundress. looks great with flip flops, sandals, wedges or booties. will be a great piece for summer but the darker colors also make it the perfect transition to fall dress.",1
"I'm a pretty solid 10 these days (and had no trouble fitting into other size 10 dresses at the store). the large was so tight around my hips. i barely got it on. they didn't have an xl to try on, but i can't imagine i would have fit in it. so, if you have wide hips, this is not the dress for you. it fit fine on top in the l, it was just so tight in the hips that it did not lay nicely.",0
"This dress is sort of a mixed-media dress. the top colored portion is a slinky knit that dolan uses all the time. i like it a lot. the bottom, is a tight silky twill-like weave. the silhouette is straight, which is what attracted me to it, but when i put it on, i realized that the waist wasn't going to work for me. the split came at a point too high for me to belt and the sleeves made my wide shoulders look dowdy. i am not a person that wants to put on a dress and have to style the heck out of i",0

I ordered this skirt because it looked cute and versatile. when it arrived the pleat in front (shown in the center) was far to the right so the overall look was crooked. not sure if it was a quality control issue or if that's the true design but it will have to go back. too bad because i had high hopes!,0
I am petite but chesty and this dress is flattering. it is a loose fit but not tight across the bust line. i tried it on with nude shoes and it dresses it up. i ended up buying this dress in a regular cut (s) because i wanted it to not be so short which made it look more like a casual dress to wear with the ocean behind you. i think it is a perfect day dress to go anywhere and by changing your shoes or adding a thin sweater or short jacket you can go out to dinner or theatre. the picture is a tr,1
Love this shirt! got it in white and it will be perfect for spring! very flattering fit!,1

"I really wanted to like this top. in person though, the fit was too large and boxy. i did order a smaller size based on other reviews but it was still too sacklike. i got the grey motif pattern which i thought was quite pretty and interesting. the material was nice and lightweight. perhaps it would look better on someone with a straight figure and small bust.",0
Ordered two of these and they fit great and will be perfect for layering.  true to size fit.  cute detail in the back for a racer tank!,1
"I am going to have to disagree with the first reviewer. this is not the most beautiful top i have ever purchased from retailer, but i like it. it is a nice change from the swing silhouette that tendd to look like maternity wear on me. the key to this is to tighten the drawstring a bit. it is a working drawstring all the way around, and i find that the top is much cuter with the drawstring cinched a bit. i actually like the flowing arms, too. the fabric is lightweight - nice for the very warm midwe",1
Pretty disappointed in this sweater. should have sized down because it's quite wide. i also didn't like the stair step. the back clung to my rear. not attractive. the colors seemed to be striking online but in reality are not. returning mine.,0
"This dress looks nothing like the photo. the sequins are dull, no sheen at all. the faux leather panels and straps look and feel like cheap, shiny plastic. i didn't even try it on, because it was so hideous, when i pulled it out of the box. not remotely worth the price and wouldn't buy it on sale for $20 either. skip.",0
"Gals, if you absolutely must have this top wait for it to go on sale (don't worry, it will). between the poor fit and the polyester, i have no good things to report about it. this is very much below retailer's usual quality and style.",0
"I ordered this online which is always a gamble when it comes to fit. i was pleasantly surprised. color is true white and lace is not flimsy which i appreciate. good coverage of the girls so i don't have to layer over a tank. also arm holes don't gap and they're not too tight. beautiful with trousers, jeans or a skirt. i've already worn it twice to work. i know i'll be wearing it a lot. fit seems true to size. i usually order a medium and i ordered a medium which fits me perfectly.",1
"Cute sweater, i really like the grey color. unfortunately, it was boxy and a little short on me. almost worth keeping, but even with a t-shirt underneath, i wanted to scratch my skin off. it's very itchy. mine is going back.",0
"I have two tracy reese skirts from a few years back that i still wear. so i am favorably disposed to this designer's style and quality. this is a slim fitting skirt, though i ordered it in a 6 and my two others are 8s. so i don't agree with previous review that this skirt runs large. it is nicely fitted and flattering. it does not ride up when sitting, which is almost amazing. i wish the pockets laid a bit flatter. also, on my skirt there is no sewn-in fabric or laundering instructions. none! th",1
"Loved it online for its modern cut and print. however, when i received the item i was disappointed. i ordered my usual size 4 and i was swimming in it. i like oversized things and understand that this dress is made that way; however, this was not flattering. i would say i would have needed to size down to a 0 and perhaps it would work but i didn't want to take another chance. the material seemed almost crepey, which i wasn't neccissarily expecting either. bummer that it didn't work out.",0
"I love these pants! the pattern is polished and the flowy style is perfect for warm weather. i ordered a small and was worried they would be too short (i'm 5'10""), but they are just right when i wear them just slightly lower than my true waist. my new favorite summer pants.",1
I ordered a size 16 in the orange. it ran a size smaller than normal size 16 maeve tops. the quality of the material was terrible. it wrinkled and was also so thin that you need to wear a tank underneath. that messes with the look of the lace on the top. the color of the orange was gorgeous.,0
"Very cute shirt, well made, nice detail, but a little long for my taste but i did keep it",1
Super cute and comfy. bottom of the legs have about a 8in slit that is not shown in pictures. also the hem came unraveled after the first wear. worth the money on sale! received many compliments. not see through!,1
"I wore this for the first time this weekend and loved it. it is long and lean but not baggy or tent like. i'm 6'0"" so i appreciate the length and fit. 
will get a lot of use out of this. good w/ skinny jeans and i can't seem to have enough black tops.",1
"Great fabric, details, construction...but, it is not grey!! definitely shades of brown!! i do like the look & style of this top.",1
"I'm happy i bought this top. it's very cute and almost a little immature/childish, but with the right bottoms it looks classy. i found it to run large so i sized down one size and it fits good, though the straps can feel a little tight if it rides up. it washes beautifully. will probably not work on large chested women.",1
"Very cute top. does require a strapless bra as the straps are further out than most tops, and they also tend to fall down. also, while the top fit well, the top button gaps are far apart and tended to separate to show my chest. easy fix with a snap sewed in.",1
"This top runs a bit small, but it's very pretty. i got the ivory and it's beautiful, very form fitting. it is a bit see thru so i will probably wear a tank under it. it's simple tshirt material, so i feel like it should be a bit less $.",1
"Lovely fabric, color and embellishment but this shirt was so long i can't even imagine wearing it over leggings.  i felt like i was wearing a dress.  there are too many cute tops on the market to bother having this one tailored (i don't buy sewing or ironing).  
disappointed.",0
"I can't believe how much i paid for this top~got free shipping special; so worth it. i ordered the blue and i love it! size small fits perfectly. i am into peplum tops lately, they are so flattering with highwaisted jeans. i usually wear a size 4-6 in retailer.",1
"A flattering soft basic! i'm 5'2"" 120 lbs and purchased the small on sale.",1
Art on a dress- belt on the back makes it interesting,1
"I just got this and couldn't wait to wear it to work today. it is such a pretty designed top. unfortunately, it is falling apart as i write this review. one sleeve is unraveling. there are strings hanging off all over the lacy arms. am so disappointed in the quality. i'll be sending it back when i get home.",0
"I tried on the xs in the store, and i don't need a petite in this, but perhaps a xxs. it is on the shorter side, so no great on my muscular thighs (if petite) whereas the regular size hit me just above the knee. the cut is away from the body, a bit ""a-line"", but not fitted. the colors are gorgeous, but i think this is more of a casual dress, like brunch with the girlfriends, for example. love it... it is now in my wish list for alter :-)",1
"I have a racetrack bra that works with the arm holes (a bit large - like you see on the model), so i am not concerned about them. i may or may not have my tailor tack them in. length was good, knee length (some of retailer dresses are a tad short for my 40-yr old self). shape was flattering. i've some weight on my bum and things, even though i'm small. the back of the dress hung well, not clinging to the derriã¨re. the swing shape didn't overly accentuate my hips. i really love the dress. it's a kn",1
This dress is very pretty and we'll made. it runs pretty big though and i would suggest going a size down.,1
"I ordered this top in all 3 colors, love the peplum.look..
returned the green, which is actually my fav color but it wasn't a pretty shade of green and i don't think that it was a flattering contrast with the cream,, especially going into spring/summer..
kept the yellow and the navy and love..
the navy is classic and the yellow is soft and flattering.
it's a very cute top, runs a little large, but is very pretty.",1
"Just as pictured, this little top is just too cute! the fit is exceptional, and quite flattering. another very feminine top, and the yellow color is perfect! i love pairing yellow with black, of course...but also with reds, blues...and it looks great with white 'pedal pushers'!!! i think they call them 'cropped' now a days! at any rate...this is a first rate top that i highly recommend!",1
"Love the look of this and the fabric, but runs way small. i usually wear a 0. ordered the 0, then 2. just got the 4 and it's still too small. will be returning all 3.",0
"I was really disappointed when this arrived and i discovered that it's basically see-through.  it's well constructed, it's just a really thin material.",0
"I just got this dress in the mail and tried it on. i loved it the fit was perfect tts, and it is very soft and comfortable. however, it appears that the black striped area has bled onto the off white portion and there are stripes of gray across the chest and blotches on the sides of the dress. i am sending it back and ordering another and hoping for the best. i am very concerned that when it is cleaned it will bleed again. i love the dress so much i am willing to risk it, but i am doubtful. so b",0
"I wanted to love this kimono...it is such a beautiful color and would work well with so many things in my wardrobe, but alas it went back due to the strange feel of the fabric...not a soft touch and because it runs small. i bought the m/l and usually wear a 12/14 but i couldn't bring the kimono together in the front (for a belting option).",0
"As other reviews have mentioned, this top has serious craftsman ship flaws. strings hanging off embellishments on sleeves and they begin unravelling as you try the top on. i wanted to love but sadly, returned asap.",0
"So often you find dresses in a cool, breathable material like rayon or silk, but the manufacturer lines it in hot, non-breathable polyester. which leaves you sweating on a hot summer day (or night). thankfully, someone at antropologie knows what they're doing and this gorgeous silk dress is lined in rayon. thank you to that person.

yes, this dress is a bit on the short side. with it's modest neckline, it looks like it could be great for work, but it does hit a bit above the knee, so if you wo",1
"This dress didn't do much for me on the hanger but it was on sale and thought i would try it on in the store. so glad i did, definitely cuter on than just hanging there. the back has a belt feature that adds a little structure. the colors are nice and bright. will be good for our hot austin summers.",1
"I tried this on in the navy/white combination and loved it, except it is cut rather full or large through the waist especially. if you can size it down so it fits you, you will love it. it is very soft; an easy top to throw on, feel comfy, and look fantastic! i sure wish it was smaller :/",1
"I wanted to like this but it just didn't have much of a shape, not flattering at all. maybe if i was taller?",0
"I tried this dress on in the store today, and the armholes were so wide, it showed my bra under the arm almost to the bottom, and it showed part of the side cup of my bra at the front. while the dress seems like it will be really comfy, the arm cuts are so unnatural, i had to pass. i did try going down in size, and petite, and neither of those options worked to fix the situation.",0
"Love the colors on this adorable, flattering style!",1
"I have been a big fan of this canadian designer so when i saw the sweater on the web, i immediately ordered it. on the website, it looks very modern and edgy chic. i was heartbroken when i saw it in person. when i opened the bag and put on the sweater, i noticed a lot of little black marks on the bathroom floor. it came from the sweater. size small was swimming on me and the holes on the shoulders, which supposed to look modern...well, the thin cheap material the sweater looks like it's ripped.",1
"It's a casual dress with a luxurious feel. very flowy, but the back panel gives it a bit more structure. i like that it graces my body without showing any lumps. i will very much appreciate it on hot days! i'm anticipating a big of headache when ironing it, but i appreciate that it's not dry clean only. i'm on the shorter side of average height and it hits me mid-thigh.",1
"The print was what attracted me to this dress. and the material is soft and comfortable. however, the fit was all wrong for me. it had a great belt in the back, but hung very loosely in the front. it reminded me a little of some of my maternity dresses. maybe sizing down would have helped, but then i feared it wouldn't fit my hips right. this dress may look better on someone who isn't as curvy. it really looks great on the model, but not on me.",0
"What attracted me to this beautiful piece is the lure of angel of the north quality and design. i know that this sweater/jacket will be worn and enjoyed this fall / winter and years to come; it's a classic beauty. when i put it on, it has a comfortable vibe, high quality, medium weight, dark black wool, and beautiful lines. i love the deep collar, slightly lower back hem, and inverted pleat at back waist to give a slight flare to the drape .it accents a feminine look and will be an invaluable st",1
"The fabric is super soft and comfortable and the look is cute, however the drape on the front crossover is not great and doesn't flatter well. the shorts will probably run a little on the short side for some - i'm very short (5') and the length is great for me but i'm guessing not for the average height.",0
"This is a great piece, it fits really well and the fabric is nice and soft. it is a good thickness so you don't have to wear a shirt underneath.",1
Looks great on. i am 5'11 and the length is perfect hits above the knee but not too short. also room in the chest area.,1
"Ok, so first things first. i'm 5'4"", 125#, 4/27, 32g and i took a small in this. it's your typical cloth/stone fabric and feel sooo good!
i do agree that this romper is on the shorter side but i liked that about it. it is far more flattering than the modeling photos online. it doesn't look that ""oversized"". i can see where taller ladies won't go for the shortness but at 5'4"" that's just not an issue for me. the bottom is very flattering and doesn't do that ""long grandma butt"" that some rompers",1
"This product was very disappointing. fabric was thin, it has no shape and hangs like a pajama top. so it's not flattering at all. at $78, it's really overpriced for what it is. it might look good on someone who has the perfect body shape (what wouldn't?), but they would probably still look like they went out in their pjs. i'm 5'9"" and not well-endowed (a b), so it did nothing for me..

also, the online picture of the moss version looks like it's a grey/black combo. it's not... it is really green",0
"Just received this and know i will get a lot of enjoyment from it. cute fit and since i have had something similar in the past, i know how versatile it is. nice soft material too!",1
"This is well made and beautiful, but it sometimes slides off so i feel like i'm adjusting it somewhat regularly.",1
"I ordered this on a whim and didn't expect to like it as much as i do. it is very flattering on and seems like you could dress it up or wear it more casual. the back is all lace, in the photo she must be wearing a cami because it is see through in person. some people may be able to pull off a black bra but i am wearing a cami, which also helps with the low cut in the front. it has sort of a flirty a line shape to it, my top is a bit shorter on me than the model photo. the top is also well made,",1
"I love dark colors and i loved the summer touch to this top that i feel like i can wear it year round! the little anchors on the buttons are such a cute touch (very retailer). it does run slightly smaller, but not in an extreme way. i'd love to see more styling options for this top because i'm a little stumped at how to wear it outside of my white high waisted shorts, haha.",1
These fit around the waist but there is so much fabric and it poofs out and looks awful and bulky. no way.,0
"I tried this shirt at my local retailer and absolutely loved it ...until i read dry clean only!!!
really retailer? i know you can do better than that...",0
"I loved these on the hanger when i saw them in the store. i liked the fabric, but found the full cut of the pant added a ton of bulk to my hips (and i don't have big hips). i also thought the waist was a bit snug while the rest of the pant ran tts. they went back.",0
"This is such a gorgeous tee with beautiful embroidery. the colors are exactly as shown and while i take petite sizes at 5""1, i like the length of the regular for myself. i'm 104 pounds and tried the xxs but found it to be too fitted and went with the xs in the end. i do feel that it fits tts and that is just a personal preference.",1
"Looked really cute on the hanger, so i took it with me into the dressing room. the fabric is super soft, and the top is very flattering however the bottom is way too short! you can't tell from the picture but the sides are rounded and go up higher on your leg. the model has the waist band pulled lower than i think you'd most likely be wearing it making the outfit appear longer. i wish i could pull this off...maybe i'm just too old for it.",0
"I thought the photo of these pants was so cute. when i got them in the mail i opened the package and just began to laugh over how long they were. i held the waist up to my chest, just below my shoulders and the pants still hit the ground. i am not a short woman! i ordered a 14, i am 5' 6"". i also found the waistband a little small in relation to the size.",0
"This dress is even better in person than in the photos online. the colors are vibrant, the material has a nice, warm weight to it, and the buttons give the whole dress that something extra to make it special. i only wish the dress came with a couple of extra buttons, as the first time i wore it one of the buttons came loose and i had to sew it back on to make sure it didn't fall off.

the dress does run a little small, i think - i normally am an extra small, but the small fit me very well.",1
"This sweater dress is very beautiful in person. the colors are very ""fall"", i actually decided against it only because i felt it was too busy for my personality. as for the fit, it runs fairly true to size, maybe slightly small. i tried on my usual medium, but i think i would have sized up for a more relaxed look. for reference, i'm 5'6"", 135 lbs, and wear a size 6. this could be quite a stunning piece on the right person!",1
"I don'tr even know why they btohered making a tall size for this, i would need a 6-7 inch heel for the petite version, which means regualr sized people should get petite.
also, bigger, as in loose, i tried 0 and 2 and both ewre biggish (thopugh i could honestly not tell the difference). sales person told me to try 00, so we shall see... i will need to hem them if i kleep them though.

bronze color is very nice, so is balck, i ordered both for comparison.

lastly, cut is very flattering,especiall",1
"This dress is beautiful. very vibrant and rich looking...however, after wearing it to work the back of the dress was completely stretched out from sitting in my office chair. when i stood up a little bubble remained around my butt. not attractive. i wanted to love it but it's going back.",0
The armholes on this dress are totally bizarre. i can't believe no one else has commented on them yet. i am a size s on top and m on the bottom so i usually try on both in dresses. i tend to be a small/ size 6 in retailer. the armholes are so long that the dress doesn't lay right on top. i showed it to on of the clerks in the store and she agreed with me. we looked at all the others and they were the same. going up a size made it way worse. this dress might work for someone with really broad shoul,0
"This dress looked gorgeous, light and lacy in the picture, but when it arrived, the ""lace"" that appeared gold and black in the photo was more a solid brown pattern against the black which was not attractive. the inner sheath was made of a heavy, sequined material. it was uncomfortable, scratchy and felt like i was searing chain mail. it also added bulk to the dress, so that i looked ten pounds heavier. i can't imagine why they would design this delicate dress with such a heavy inner slip. the si",0
"Like other reviewers have said, this item runs extremely long and large. i could have fit my body in one pant leg they were so wide--much wider than any standard wide leg pant i've owned. sadly had to return.",0
"I coveted this dress for so long, but this was a case of the photo giving me a different visual impression than seeing it in real life. the ""gold"" patterns on top aren't shiny and delicate in person as i had imagined, and they actually make a very strong impression up close (and are painted on, it seems). the mesh they lay on is also more coarse than i had hoped. the coolest part about this dress, though, is the shiny, sequined black underlay. the photo doesn't do that component justice. i was s",0

"I wanted to love this warm dress because the colors and the material are beautiful. unfortunately, i couldn't make the fit work. for reference, i am 5'3, 110 pounds and usually wear an xs in retailer clothing. like other reviewers, i found the xs to be a bit tight around the arms, and i don't have particularly large arms, so i ordered the sp, hoping it would be roomier and shorter (the regular length came down to mid-knee). unfortunately, the sp was enormous; it was in no way a petite. it was as l",0
"I wanted to love this dress so much! but unfortunately it fell a little short of my expectations. the overall quality of the dress is great! it's very light, flowy, and super comfortable to wear. i just wish it was a bit more flattering. i debated on returning it since it didn't really give me any shape but the material was so darn comfortable and such an easy outfit to thrown on that i couldn't part with it.",1
"This dress is beautiful with gorgeous coloring, nice thick, stretchy fabric and wonderful detailing including buttons. the only issue i had with it is that it's does run small, especially in the bust. i'm normally a medium to large, depending on cut so after reading the previous reviews, i ordered a large and it's pretty snug. still deciding whether i will keep or try for an xl, which is doubtful in availability at this point. i ordered it with two other pieces, both of those a medium fit fine.",1
"I ordered the geranium and teal. geranium is an awkward pink, but i loved the teal. beautiful color. ordered large, hoping for some length. they're very lightweight and almost too short. if you hold this up its just a big rectangle, but it flows nicely over the body and has the appearance of being longer on the sides. unfortunately you can see all of my bra and to my stomach when my arms are even slightly raised. i decided to return both.",1
"The dress arrived with two large buttons missing from the front complete with unraveling threads. the rest of the buttons are sewn on loosely, and in general, it's poor quality. ridiculous considering the price, very disappointed.",0
"So, i bought 2 of these. first in xsp. it was actually the regular length not the petite one. it did have the problem mentioned by others regarding the arms, armpit, thighness issue. i thought maybe the dress was mislabeled and i got a regular xs by mistake. so i returned and order another xsp hoping i would get one with the right length, but no. the one i got has same issues as the first one. why 2 petite dresses with regular length/? i think the dresses are defective. the print is gorgeous and",0
"There's something majorly wrong with the way the armholes are cut. i can't move my arms in this dress. otherwise the fit was fine. the a line cut of the dress is great if ur trying to hide a few pounds. other than that the does nothing for your figure. i found this dress to be true to size in an xsp im 107lbs and 5'1"".
don't buy it. i know it's tempting with the sale price.",0
"If you look closely at the pattern it is a giant triangle running across the front of your body. this doesn't do great things really if you have more of an hourglass shape or small waist. it completely removed the idea that you have a small waist and draws attention to the area of the triangle that is the largest. also, i agree with another reviewer about being cautious about buttons, as several were off some of the dresses.",0
"I loved the look of this dress online, so i was excited to order it, but when it arrived i found it was not at all how i expected it to be. i thought the material would be more lacy, but it seemed pretty cheap. there was also some boning at the waist which is nice in theory, but it made the material poof out just under the waist, making me look like i had a belly. no matter what i did i could not get it to lay flat. returned to the store and bought the embroidered perennial dress instead, which",0

"This dress is so pretty and the fabric is tightly woven so that it won't stretch as much as other sweater dresses. i am disappointed in the sleeves though. the cut is way below the armpit so that when you raise your arms, it pulls tight and is uncomfortable. for the price, and the amount of time i wanted to wear it, it's not worth keeping. another thing is that the fabric is tightly woven so if you are cold natured and ok with the sleeve issue, this is the dress for you. however, if you are hot",0
"This top is very pretty and looks so good with the blue flower skirt. unfortunately it runs very small. it fit my bust but would not go down. i imagine it would look better on a much slender frame, but since it fit my bust i wonder if the armholes are too big or it maybe a bit loose at the top. i like the style and design a lot, very dressy, but the buttons at the top are a bit hard to put on and remove. since this is turtleneck, every time you wear it the buttons have to come on and off. the bu",1

"This skirt was too big so i returned it but did like it well enough to re-order. quality seems average; my only complaint is the lining seems too short for the skirt. why, on a maxi, is the slip lining a mini? the first thing my husband said was that it needed a slip. he didn't think it had one as he could see through the skirt to my knees. this is very lightweight fabric but could be worn all year around depending on the leg wear that is worn with it. it is a very versatile piece which is why i",1
Love these shorts! fit true to size and the material is so amazing.,1
"The cut on this is fantastic, every color way is vibrant and appealing. length just skims over where my hips broaden, which is nice, and my shoulders look strong and tan. however. i prefer cotton, or at least a cotton blend. this fabric is appealing in that the sweat wicks, the colors will never fade, and the shape won't change. i find the man made fabric very very hot, though.",1

"I really wanted to like this, but like other reviews say, the knit fabric pills easily and i don't think the tank feels or looks as good as it would were it cotton. a good deal on sale, but i don't think it will hold up very long. i got the teal/white, as black/white and coral/navy were sold out.",0
"Really love the pattern and color combination. the dress has an attached lining to around the knee. i would say this is tts or a little big. i'm 5'8"" and around 135 and size s fits well with a bit of extra room around the waist. print and fabric cover any perceived flaws and create a long, lean look. i love the feeling of effortlessness--with cute sandals this is an outfit.",1
"While you can't count on the photo on your monitor to portray the exact color of an item, these photos are way off.  instead of the warm charcoal i see online, the pants are more of a dusty blue.  the material has very little stretch and i couldn't get into the size 24s.  the 25s were tight in the entire leg but huge in the waist.  for reference i usually wear a size 24 in brands like 7 for all mankind and citizens of humanity.",0
Cute everyday shorts. run tts to maybe just slightly small. not too short for this mid 30s mom.,1
Love this t-shirt....i will be wearing this until it wears out. very soft; great fit; and very comfortable....,1
"I'm going through a blouse phase, and this was exactly what i wanted. i'm not svelte, and blouses rarely hang off my frame in a flowy flattering manner, but this one is perfect! it is just loose enough and just form accentuating enough that it looks amazing! i am petite with broad shoulders and a large ribcage/short torso, so flowy is a tough one for me.",1
"I was very excited about this dress having seen someone where it on the street months ago. i got my usual size 6 and could not button it up for the life of me. i get it, i'm busty and sometimes button downs are a tricky. however, the arms were impossibly tight. my boyfriend starting cracking up when he saw my arms busting out of the sleeves.",0
"Completely in love with this dress! i'm a huge fan of byron lars, and this one by far is my favorite. everything about this dress is perfect. it's very well made too. i usually wear a size 4, but kept the size 6 instead. the waist felt a bit too tight with the 4. btw: the belt is adjustable.",1
"Great style but not so great quality:(
stone fell off right away.
but they still look great",1
This blouse is a disappointment . fabric is cheap looking and the cut is very off. just odd. sleeves awkward . the back of the white shirt on the on-line model is not the same as the white shirt i received. mine was plain in the back like the blue shirt on line even though my shirt was white. no ruffle. returned.,0
Gorgeous color! salmon not pink though! lovely soft drape fabric but the itty bity thread and hook in the center is awful! i am a size 2/4 d cup and ordered a small and the closure is not adequate at all! it looks terrible closed and is too revealing without a cami underneath. does not fit like the model!,0
This dress is like a piece of art. absolutely beautiful on. i wore it to a charity event and received several compliments. it's just so gorgeously different!,1
Beautiful shirt. the color is more navy than pictured. the middle of the moon is stitched embroiderer - very original and a fun texture. my only qualms with this shirt is the trapezoid cut - it flairs out slightly but enough to notice from shoulders to the bottom hem.,1
"I am 5'8"", 140lbs, pear-shaped. i ordered the s and it fit perfectly, just skimming the floor. the material is a beautiful gauzy metallic material that is lightweight with a beautiful drape and wonderful sorbet-inspired colors. the waistband is elasticized but not elastic, and there is no unflattering poofing, which can happen with skirts like this. the flaw, however, is in the decision to only half-line this skirt with an off-white jersey material. the half-lining isn't horrible but i found it",0
"I thought these would be nice, and they are but then i started thinking that the bejewels will eventually be out of style and these can't be as much of a classic... also, the jewels make the jeans feel heavier. 
fit is like most boyfriend/girlfriend jeans, slightly loose (not as much on me due to muscles) and length on petite was close to what is shown here (typical for me that it is still a bit longer, as not only am i short, but i have short legs for my shortness!)

so if you want that styl",1
"Soft fabric, the blue is a nice color, rich. the drape effect is very flattering on the body. the length of the regular xs was fine on me, i often get petite but would not need it in this case. could wear this with jeans or dress it up with a nice skirt. good basic.",1
"I wanted to love this skirt and i agree with the other reviewers. the color of the skirt is beautiful. i've never seen anything quite like it at retailer! the quality is superb and the material is fairly substantial given the brocade design. however, the skirt made my hips look a lot bigger than they are because the shape of the skirt is more of a tulip-design. i purchased an 0 petite (because my normal size 00 petite was sold out) and while the waist part fit the hip part was disproportionately l",1
"I ordered the white and the light blue in size xl. both are cut much smaller than is typical for my other retailer xl blouses. everything the first reviewer wrote is true. the photos of the white top show a detailed back when it is plain (like the blue). the back is just a solid, kind of slippery material. it's strange because it's not see-through in the back but you need to wear a tank/cami for the front. so, it makes the shirt that much tighter since you need to have the extra layer. 

i would",0
"This top would be perfect if not for the large gap in the front where it wraps. the hook and loop just do not work to keep the top closed. love the pink color and the fit otherwise. i am almost always a medium but the small was perfect for me. for reference: 5'6"", 145 lbs, 34dd.",0
"I bought this top to match a maxi skirt and it was pretty close to perfect.  i got the blue color,  which is more of a brighter blue than a navy.  i'm 6ft and wear a 10 top, but got this in a large hoping to gain some length in the torso out of the of a large and could have gone a size down.  the top was definitely long enough and i didn't have the problems with the gaping at the hook that other reviewers had. this is probably because i went a little larger in the sizing and i have a very small",1
"Purchased this in white specifically because i loved the back detail-- (i don't know why most designers overlook the back??). huge disappointment-- the back is totally plain, not at all like the picture of the white top on here and the fabric in the back isn't even the same material as the front. it's almost as if the back is made out of leftover lining from another garment. it was a very sad return! i usually love this brand, this was just a quality control oversight i guess.",0
"I really wanted to love this, but it had so much fabric around the waist i looked like i was about to deliver twins. for ref, i'm 5'3"" 105 lbs. the top area fit fine (had a little extra room on either side under armpit area, but not so much it would've deterred me from keeping it). i adore peplum and flouncy tops--it wasn't that i didn't realize that was the intended style here. it was very cute from the front and back, but when i turned sideways it was just omg huge. like tent huge. i kept look",0
"Very very boxy design/cut. try on first or buy knowing you are 90% likely to return. beautiful skirt but if you don't have the right body type/measurements, will not flatter you at all.",0
Ag jeans have been a main stay for me. they are the most comfortable and best looking jeans on my body. however this pair was too tight and shorter then i liked. the fabric and color is beautiful. i wear the same size for ag no matter the design. but this one ran too small. i have to return it. i will try the next size up if they still have them.,0
This skirt is a keeper. great quality. beautiful color. great fit!,1
The colors in this skirt are gorgeous. a super pretty emerald/green color with graphic silver and black flowers. this skirt can be dressed up or dressed down. i'm loving the idea of wearing black tights and flat boots with it to make it casual or wearing it with tights and heels for a holiday party. the weight of the skirt isn't heavy so i think with the right colors can wear it in spring too.,1
"I'm not sure if the top i received was damaged or if the design didn't consider gravity but this is not what i expected. i really want to like this top, but i don't see how i can wear it.",0
"The skirt is very pretty, but it's not as dark as the street pictures which i like those colors better. it's also super long. it will have to be hemmed if i decide to keep it. for reference, i'm 5'7"" and it was sweeping the floor (size medium). given the price, i'm not certain i will keep it. i'll try it on a few times, then decide.",1
"Not sure who this is for but its not for me. skirt was long, stiff and puffy on my hips. i could not get it to lie correctly. maybe you have to be 6' to pull this off...",0
"I can't often turn down a white blouse, so this caught my eye online and then in person. i love the concept but found the top to be rather large despite it being an xs. i would have to size down to an xxs, which i'm not certain would be long enough on my 5'7"" frame. there was extra space in the armholes and space around the waist, even factoring in its flowy style. it's not worth it to me to order an xxs online since my store doesn't carry it.",0
"I bought this shirt with the intentions of using it as a nursing top. to that effect, i'm happy with the purchase, and will get a lot of use out of it. i bought two on blush and one blue at the same time. however, i was surprised that the shirt was so open and loose. i thought it was just a deep v-neck, but the design actually really opens up once the hook and eye is undone at the top. you are then very exposed, there is nothing but an opened front shirt. this is convenient for a nursing mother,",0
"Nice modern print, vibrant colors, and not sheer (no need to add an extra layer which is nice for those of us who run hot!)",1
"This t is so pretty in person. the gold is metallic with embroidered detail. this is my first purchase of this brand, so my usual size medium fit just fine. i am excited to put this under one of my blazers for a casula friday. it is quite unusual and great quality.",1
I love this suit. the color is stunning and the quality of the material is excellent. a one piece never looked so good!,1
"Very disappointed the back of this blouse is plain, not as displayed.",0
Loved the idea of these as soon as i saw them!  great mid weight jean.  a little large in the waist.  the rhinestones sparkle and i received tons of complements when i wore these jeans!  great dressed up or down!,1
"I purchased this when it was on sale and it is a great, comfortable, and forgiving top. this top again runs a bit large, so i ordered a size down and it fits great. i think that they are off a bit on their description of the color. i ordered ?pink? but i would consider it more of an orangish red color. not my favorite but not terrible either. overall it is a great shirt.",1
"This basketweave bikini top in fractals red by mara hoffman is my favorite right now. soft, fully lined, and reversible to pale pink as are the matching basketweave bikini bottoms. the pattern looks like a vibrant watercolor painting with some fuzzy edges.

I am 125lbs and purchased the petiite small. the dress is very flattering and can easily be dressed up or down. the fabric is a medium weight and does not cling to trouble areas.,1
"I am a pilcro hyphen fan and have bought nearly every embellished jean they've made in the last few years. these, however, are just not for me. i love the faded wash, and i thought the embellishment would be fun for the fall and holidays. however, there's just so much of it! it's beautifully done, but the jeans actually feel bulky and stiff in the pocket and upper thigh area. i've had other ""beaded"" jeans, but they didn't feel quite so ""crunchy"" when i wore them. one other note: these seem to ru",0

"This tank i am in love with. the color is great to go with jeans or any color i have in my wardrobe. it works with skinny jeans, culottes or a skirt and perfectly compliments the current shoe styles. my gladiators, summer booties, and my espadrilles are all equally cute with this outfit topper. it is made out of the most beautiful lightweight material and will be great for the 100 degree plus summers that we have here in texas. the bra thing is a bit of a problem because a strapless bra dose not",1
Really cute and comfy and casual skirt. i am looking forward to travelling in this skirt and running around for the summer. i did size down one size. highly recommend. will get lots of wear.,1
"I bought this cute ruffled tank in ivory to go with a silk wrap skirt i've had. it arrived today and it fits perfect. i am 5'5"", 125 lbs and small busted 34b. i bought size small after reading the reviews and glad i did because it fits perfect. the straps are not too long (a common problem for me), it's a nice length, nipped a bit a bit at the waist with slight flare below. also it does not gap under the arms which is much appreciated. a lot of thought went into this little top. i can wear it to",1
"This dress is extremely comfortable and the material is very soft. i was worried it would be too clingy but it hangs nicely. the length is just right, although the pockets hit below my hips. i was a little unsure of the bold pattern but i liked it better in person. i bought it to wear on an upcoming beach vacation but now i plan to pair it with flats and sweaters for the fall.",1
"The fit on this is so strange. the middle string is definitely too long and the thin halter top offers hardly any lift. the print is lovely and the quality nice for the price. the cups are padded, which is nice i suppose, but would barely cover anything bigger than a c cup i'm guessing. i'm a 32dd, size 8 in pants, and size 4/6 in dresses and i ordered a medium. i also have a long torso, which probably didn't help.",0
"Love, love, love. like another chambray item i have, they feel stuff and rough after washing, but once you put them on, they soften up and look great.",1
"I&#39;m taller (5&#39;8), so it&#39;s not uncommon for things to be too short on me, but this was really short for the style.  it was very wide and loose all over in my usual size - both up top and in the wavy part below.  the style really just did not work with the length.  it looked very odd.",0
"I was very disappointed by the fit of this top. it is quite short (especially in the back) and very wide. i did not find it flattering. on a positive note, the fabric is nice and thick - very warm layering piece for fall. for sizing reference, i'm 5'5'', 122 lbs, and took my usual size xs.",0
"I ordered a m and l based on the reviews - and both were too big. this is a drapey top with large arm(pit) openings.
i have since ordered a small and hope this fits well.
in general, this top is beautiful.
i usually wear a 4/6 or s/m top/blouse and am 5'8"" with a slim build. the m should have fit better than it did.",1
"I'm not sure if it was my undergarments or not, but the top clung to me in a strange way. the colors are rich but in addition to the odd fabric, the sleeves did not flatter my upper arms.",0
Love this! i sized up to xl from large.. great pattern. very soft. i am thick legged and big booty. this romper is the perfect length. the only issue is when i need to use the bathroom. hard to unzip from the back in a hurry. i had my husband unzip for me in order to pull down.,1
"Having recently purchased a pair of citizen jeans from retailer in my normal size, i went ahead and ordered these because i needed a skinnier fit (my stevies finally ripped). they fit sort of big in the seat, but improved upon washing and are a bit more snug. i took them to the tailors and had the length taken up (i always have to do this, but these were particularly long). they are not as skinny as on the model, but will still working for going to work. not really what i was looking for (an every",1

"I've noticed this sports bra several times in my store-along with a whole line of products that share this fabric and didn't feel necessarily compelled to try it on but i finally did this last time at retailer. i pretty much predicted what i was going to think of it. i like the back with the extra strappy open section, but that is where it ends. the fabric is not particularly flattering, and i didn't think the bra accentuated my chest. i do have a small bust size, but i have a lot of sports",0
Loved the design but jacket looked like 20 years old because of a lot of piling even brand new jacket at store. i wish they use better quality fabric so i would have purchased it.,0
"I'm pear-shaped so my inclination is to always grab an a-line/fit-n-flare style dress or skirt. but for some reason this stood out to me and i'm glad i tried it on. i love this dress! i'm 5'9 with a longer torso and this still went down to my knees so it definitely works for taller girls. the cut is so flattering and, along with the thicker material, it gives me more of an hourglass shape that enhances my curves instead of making me want to camouflage them. i got my dress in a size 6 and it's tt",1
"Got this in the sky color. returned it because the top is way too sheer for me, if you know what i mean. i wanted a pretty gown i can wear without a robe in front of my kids. no can do. also, for the price, material just felt flimsy & cheap. it does run small ~ the medium was good on me and i'm 5'2"", 114#, 34b",0

"Contrary to the first review, i find this top to be gorgeous. the fabric has a silkiness to it (with a slightly heavier weight). the lace thru neckline is beautifully done (the eyelets are high-quality). the fit has flow, like on the model, but still a bit of shape (not the formless fit that some blouses like this have). i love the open sleeves. i am 5' 8"" 120lbs 34b and am happy with the xs.",1
A finely laced sheer bustier along with a gown split along the sides makes for a lovely sleeping garment. the material is cooling and the lace is not itchy.,1
"I absolutely loved the patterns and colors of this skirt, if only the cut wasn't so odd. the sides of the skirt ""wing out"" for a very distracting and unflattering look. the stiff, felt-like quality of the material only makes matters worse. in that respect, the model photos are not at all accurate. it also runs large. i had to go down one full size.",0
"I am a true size xl. in my 20s i wore a small and then medium, so i know whereof i am speaking here. i tried this dress on in my local retailer store. this designer, as a handful of retailer designers seem to do, simply enlarges the fabric measurement outward as they add another size. the problem is... a funny thing happens to women's breasts as they gain weight. is this so difficult to understand? as a size small i was an a cup, as a medium i was a b cup. now, years later, as a size 16 i am a d cup",0
"I bought this online in the grey and blue and had high hopes. it runs big so size down at least 1-2 sizes. i didn't realize that the sweater looking part on the forearms was part of the coat. that part of the coat is really nice and comfy. unfortunately, the rest of the coat (the wool part) is very itchy. it would've been awesome if it was lined on the inside, but it's not...so i'm taking them back.",0

i am on the short side so i ordered in regular and petite and due to the length the petite is better. 
the material is soft and comfortable to wear.",1
"Lovelier in person! fit tts; i tried this on, walked away without it and returned to my store to purchase because i couldn't stop thinking about this dress. most definitely can be worn now, but will layer well through the winter - dress it up with heels and accessories or make it casual with a denim jacket and booties :) perfect floor length at 5'3.5"" in the regular 0; tiny bit of room in the bust for a 32b",1

"Very disappointed: runs small in chest and too long. the fabric is cheap but the print is pretty with the bead and flower detail. i don't think  this dress is worth the price, it is not even silk and the underlay feels like cheap gauze. i have been in the fashion industry for over 30 years and this is a miss mark in my opinion. put it back on the rack, and save your $ for something better at sweet retailer!",0
"I had fallen in love with the coral dress that was somewhat like this one and came out a few months ago. but the problem i'm having with this one is the same problem i had with the coral one. they are all flawed in their construction! i had eventually tried 3 size 16s in the coral because each one was flawed. on one, one side hung longer than the other, and on all 3, the top design did not line up with the bottom design. this blue one is the same way! the top design does not line up with the bot",0

"I tried this blouse on and loved the style, comfort and color of the peach so much that i was preparing to buy it. when i pulled the sleeve the fabric came away from the cuff. i tested another spot pulling only gently and the same thing happened. too bad since the color would have been a great addition for me.

This skirt has no closure along the slit. i can't begin to understand how it could be worn as shown in the photo-you would be completely exposed. it completely baffled me,0
The dress is very pretty! i ordered for a wedding and thought it was a little casual for that. in the end i returned because it wasn't very flattering for my figure.,1
Love this coat! super soft and cozy!! did not realize the sleeves are built in to the jacket. wasn't too excited at first but once i tried it on i fell in love. great quality!,1
"Love the design of this top. wish i could have gotten it in white but was sold out. it fits nicely overall, but is a little snug in the stomach area. still kept it though, because the shirt is just so pretty!",1
"The denim is soft and very comfortable, the color also is very dark and goes well with most anything. the style is 'oversized' for baggy look and for that reason the sides of the over-alls gape open requiring a long top. i usually wear a size 4 in citizen jeans, and ordered small in the overalls and had to return for an xs. i do recommend for comfort and fun. they look great with booties or flats and hit just at the ankle.",1
Has i read the reviews would have realized the t-shirt looking sleeves in the pic are attached to the sweater. based on the pic and site description i didnt realize they were attached. i thought it was part of the styling of the undershirt. i think this very much limits the versatility of the sweater. i ordered the white which is a beautiful color and very soft. i am returning it cause i do not like the t-shirt sleeve. would rather have the flexibility to layer whatever shirt i wanted,0
Beautiful sweater coat! love that is easy to pop on & head out. i did have to go to a seamstress and have the button moved as it was to large and boxy around my waist area.,1
"The design of this shirt is stunning. i can't even tell you how many people complimented me on the shirt. the only thing is it does run a bit long. with it being long, it can go nicely with leggings and boots.

material is a bit thin and should be hand-washed or dry cleaned. i do wish there were more sizes in petite.",1
Great item and very feminine. can be dressed up or down and fits true to size.,1
"This is a really pretty top. the yellow underneath is a very pretty shade and the tank itself is very soft and comfortable and just loose enough to hide any bit of tummy. the armholes are large, however, so they are low and make the front look almost like a halter with the way they come in. i would order down a size as a result. you'll be able to wear most bras with it but be aware that anything that spills out under your arms will be visible.",1
"This looks great with the pilcro lace bottom white jeans. i bought the yellow and blue and it is flattering on. longer in the back. i love the style of the sleeves. very flattering style and fun, flirty and feminine. slightly see through. depending on your modesty level a nude bra may be just fine or else a nude cami. a really fresh look for summer. i do not think it looks cheap. i do think it is overpriced but i have a hard time finding tops that hit me at the right length in front and are not",1
Beautiful overlay runs large had to return for a smaller size,1

"First, i must say that this dress fits beautifully in my usual xs (5' 4"", 119 lbs) and the geometric pattern is adorable. i often have a fit problem with dresses (i think due to a long waist) where the fabric bunches up by my lower back. not so with this dress. it shows off my curves without being super tight and the fabric has a little stretch so the dress isn't binding. for my age, however (mid-40s), this dress is just a little too short for the office so i'm sending it back. also, i felt that",1

As another reviewer wrote.. this is not the same jean featured on the website. same cut and style but it's a light denim wash with wiskering and worn look at the knees. i called customer service to see if this was a mistake and they said there was not really a way to check it unless i exchanged them. i didnt want the same wrong jeans again so i opted out ... too bad they are cure.,0
"The material is very soft and the lace has a beautiful design. it looks very elegant and romantic. you will need a racer back bra to wear with it though, because of the design of the straps. it is very flowing and i think the cut is flattering. the material in the back is slightly transparent so you might want to wear a tank underneath. overall, very pretty and i would highly recommend. (i purchased the white and yellow version.)",1
"I purchased this dress in our retailer store. i usually wear either a 0 or 2 petite (5'1"", 115 lbs.). i was able to wear a 0r in this and it fit perfectly. i paired it with a sparkly belt from retailer for a cocktail party and received lots of compliments.",1
"I was so excited to wear this shirt, even after reading the review that it curls up i decided to give this shirt a shot, and i found that the same thing happened to me. it also clings tightly to the body. i would not recommend this shirt for anyone with broad shoulders.",0
Beautiful top for summer. love the yellow under the thin white fabric. the photo is good representation. running big.,1

"So hard to guess fit and size so because i carry my weight in my tummy i ordered an xl. they were too big. the waistband is a nice, very wide, comfy elastic but fit loose. the legs were a bit baggy too and too long for my frame. the fabric is soft and has a bit of a contrast down the sides of the leg. due to the length, i decided not to reorder a smaller size. i think you'd be safe to size down in these.",1
This shirt is even prettier in person. it's really flowy but still very flattering.,1
"First off: kudos to the other reviewers for setting the expectation re: the color on these! they are not a dark rinse at all - not even close. they're a light-to-medium hue with fading down the front of the thighs. with that in mind, i do like the color - especially for spring - but would have been very miffed had i ordered these and they arrived so starkly different from the online photo.

"I am very into the lace tops! purchased this but it's a very exaggerated swing top and on someone who is 5'3, it feels almost like a tunic. lots of extra material in the back. love the look and if you're tall enough, it should work for you!",0
"I ordered these twice just to be sure there wasn't a glitch. the color is so off! the picture shows a dark blue denim, but they are not they are a light blue - with whiskering! retailer you need to have a better image of the color because this is so misleading.",0
"With a rather large chest, i am always having to size up in tops like this. the l fit well all over but the arm holes were just too low. even if i wore a navy bra (i got the navy version) it would still be cut too low. it's too bad because it is a beautiful and unique piece",0
"Love the detail of the white with yellow underneath but agree with the other reviewer that the material is very thin in the back. also, it is a flowly top so you will need to size down. however, because of the shape it will fit snuggly around the chest/arms. this didn't work for me as it accentuated my normal body type (as in not the model type). i am not overweight but it definitely didn't flatter my chest area. seems like the top worked for others so i suggest trying on first.",0
I love off the shoulder looks and had high hopes for this top. unfortunately the folded top portion doesn't stay down at all. i found myself pulling at it all day and eventually gave up. the material is also not the best.,0
This top is the epitome of late summer and getting into fall mood. it's soft fabric falls nicely on top of skinny jeans. the open shoulders are trendy and flattering!,1
Fight a bit snug over the bust then widens like a bell. not as cute as it looks in the photo. returned.,0
"I really wanted to like this top, but unfortunately it is not as pretty or flattering in person. the yellow looks dirty in real life, not pretty like the picture. it is also a strange fit/shape when it is on. i tried it on in the store and did not like it at all.",0
"I fell in love with these online. i thought they would be such a nice piece of statement denim. unfortunately they did not work for me. i am 5'2"" and the waist of these paints was four inches away from my breasts. it didn't look bad from the back but from the front it was comical. the denim itself is nice and heavy but, like the previous reviewer stated, not a dark wash. the pair i received was a medium whiskered wash. if i was taller these would have been a yes, despite the wash discrepancy.",0
"I purchased the grey jacket first and it seems to work with a lot of things and create different looks. so i purchased the tan jacket. i found it to less tan as an olive color. not my favorite color for me. but the fit is awesome and hopefully the color will prove to be versatile too. the blouse shown with it does not go with it as i had hoped.
the jacket seems very green with the golden brown in the blouse. so a black or ivory blouse with some great necklace should work. recommend. pretty true",1
Love the colors of this dress. it did run a little large. i ordered a large and medium and went with the medium.,1
"36dd, 10/12 in tops, 12/14 in bottoms

this tank is amazing! the flowing a-line shape is very flattering. the armholes are perfect - all too often i see a good tank top ruined by large, gaping armholes. no bra peek-a-boo here! fabric is a stretch micro-rib knit that doesn't cling too tightly, just enough to give the top good definition. i took the size large for the length - just past the hips on me. the side slits keep the look flowy. the light blue contrast color is light grey, while the brigh",1
"This is such a cool military jacket. when i saw it displayed on a table at my local retailer, i knew it was going home with me. this is my 4th marrakech jacket, i love their style. i bought the black in my usual size large, and i agree with the previous reviewer, if you have a chest this is a very flattering jacket. i usually wear my jackets open, and i discovered that if you button back the lapels at the second button down it looks amazing and not so sloppy. it kind of bothered me the way",1
"Not in love with this one. the fabric is thin and seems cheap... it seems overpriced even on sale. and it runs a bit small along the bust. i could maybe get away with it without a bra, but after 3 kids, braless isn't my best look. and i don't think the print is a pretty in person as it is online - can't quite put my finger on why... maybe a little darker in person. that said, the fit is flattering. the cinched waist is lovely, and the skirt is nice and flowy. even so, this one is going back.",0
"I purchased this top in the blue stripe and red. after washing the red top, it lost color in little spots and also has little holes along the seams. the blue washed fine. overall, it is a very cute top and great for summer.",1
"I am so glad that i got this one.i wish i got the bigger size,but got it on sale.i am glad,that i have it for next winter.",1
I'm obsessed with this top. i actually love that the sides are a bit higher than the front and back. i feel like that gives it shape. i bought jeans similar to the pic here and they look so good together. love!,1
Saw this top online and hoped for the best. my hopes were rewarded! lovely lightweight summery top but i think with a cardigan it could be worn in the fall also. i asked 4 friends if they liked it and they all agreed it was very flattering so i decided it was a keeper. have worn it three times since purchasing and have received lots of compliments.,1
I ordered a med petite. usually this fits but this shirt was long and the sleeves wouldnt stay down. as a regular shirt it was not cute.,0
"The image does not show but the front of the dress has a heavy 24"" utility zipper hidden with 5 snaps. the zipper pull, when closed, sat right on my collarbone, which was he height of discomfort. it felt heavy and awkward. the dress was very high waisted for me (i'm 5'6"" and it was 3"" inches above the navel)) also to the point of discomfort.

an invisible side zipper would have made the difference for me if the proportions were better suited for a non-petite sizing.

the fabric is quite beautifu",0
"This is such a beautiful top with pretty, vivid colors and soft fabric but the execution is wrong. the front is fine, the smocked upper portion is very flattering but then you turn around and the back fits like a cape. there is a ton of fabric especially in the upper portion of the shoulders and upper back, with pleats that begin under the ruffled neck and billow out. i got an xxsp (5'  103 lbs) so couldn't size down. please retailer no more billowy tops!!
so sad to have to return this one.",0
"I was so excited about this top, as the picture of the model it looks beautiful and drapey in just the right way. unfortunately, this top feels like an old grandma's polyester suit, the sides are much shorter than the front & back and the combo of the inner lining and the outer fabric feels awkward with the inner piece being significantly shorter the the outer. it also puffed out a bit at the top of the shoulders in a strange way, due to the layered fabric. 

sadly, going back.",0
This dress was really odd. i loved the quirky mixture of the blue stripe and the floral but that's about it. the shape was unflattering but honestly that could be because this dress ran large. i was just very underwhelmed with this dress. also the hidden button zipper at the front was an amazing idea but not the best execution. overall its okay just hated it on me.,0
"I ordered the blue stripe and white in size large. i didn't like it worn off shoulder but it does stay in place, which is a good thing. and it looks okay worn on the shoulders. i find the fabric so uncomfortable and itchy that i couldn't wait to take it off, immediately. i tried them on again a second time, still hopeful, with the same outcome. sadly, returning.",1
"Everything about this top is perfect! quality is great which is number one in my book. color is awesome! perfect color for fall, summer and spring! a must have!!",1
"I love linen i know it's a pain with the wrinkles but it's just a very nice crisp clean feel. this vest is wonderful it fits very nice, once you size down, and can work as a bathing suit cover up. i'm using it with my linen pants and skirts and everyone has asked me where did you get that...i think they're all gone by now but if they aren't grab it while you can it's a must have for any woman's closet.",1
"Really like this tunic a lot. it is comfortable and easy to throw on and look put together. i'm always a fan of pockets too! i ordered the xs -- i'm 5'4"" about 118#. it fits loose but not in a bad way. the fabric allows it to fall well over the body. if you are tall it will probably be too short for you as it was a few inches above my knees. glad to have snagged this right away! more tunics like this please!",1
I love purchasing these tunic/ruffle dresses because they can be worn anywhere.....this dress is definitely a little on the heavy side for winter wear...the color is beautiful...i am 5'4''. 138 pounds and always purchase a large for a relaxed fit....i plan to wear it out to dinner for my birthday and to a house party on new years day....,1
This top is well made for the price! the colors are beautiful and will work well with jeans and a leather jacket if it is cooler.,1
"For me, at 5'9"", the top was not long enough...it appeared longer in the photo. i'll be returning it. other than length, it is cute.",1
"Pros: soft, quality top, true to size, and would look great (a little tucked in) and off the shoulder

reality: it will be hard to keep the shoulders from sliding up, and (on me at least) it looked really meh...kind of dumpy.

i'm 5'6"", normally a medium/8, and i bought the medium here...fit was good. it's billowy and accurately displayed in the pictures, so as an hour-glass shaped gal, i'd need to tuck in the front (or all) or accessorize to give it a little shape. i really liked the feel a",0
"I'm glad i took a chance and ordered this jacket. i love military inspired jackets and this one is very cute.
it runs a little big, so i'm glad i ordered a size down. i like that it can be worn open or buttoned. it looks great with jeans and boots but i can wear it to work as well. it's definitely more on the casual side, but still a very versatile piece in my closet. love it.",1
"I loved the actual design on the fabric. the flowers are gorgeous and i was really looking forward to wearing them, but the fabric was much too thin for me. i was surprised because another review said they were thick. to me, it felt like tights material, almost. however, they were not see through, which is great. overall, they just didn't look great on my body. 5'9"" size 6/8 curves, medium was a bit too loose.",0
"Love this sweatshirt! i'm 5'2"" 110lbs and ordered the x-small. it's a little boxy but very comfy. it's definitely light peach in color and not pink, as shown. very happy with this purchase!",1
"I wanted these jeans so badly! i originally ordered them in my regular size -a 27. they were too big even for a tomboy fit, so i ordered a 26. the size 26 order was backordered and then cancelled. i am so sad! i would absolutely buy these if i could get them in my size. they are so soft and beautiful. i love ag's quality.",1
Great sweater with gorgeous detail. fits tts. works best in someone with smaller bust like me. pink is peachy pink like other reviewers have commented. pairing it with gray ag jeans! will work great for fall/winter in louisiana.,1
"Nice thin tank. back half is a jersey knit (different fabric than the front). good layering piece. at 5'4"" 140 lbs, the medium is a nice length, reaching my hip flexors in front ...although, i'm rather short waisted...",1
This top was very cute but super short- and i am a short waisted petitie person-the waistline hits above your belly button- looks very silly.,0
"I tried this on in my regular size and was able to get it on fine, but the cup portion of the suit was just crazy! with the straps tied tightly around my neck, it was like the cups just flipped out and open. i am a regular b cup, and i don;t think it was sizing (though i did not have the opportunity to try multiple sizes). the cup did not right and, for this reason, would make this absolutely impossible to wear. unfortunate, because the design is so pretty.",0
"On me, thsi was ginormous, looked like a mu mu. it is pretty, but there was just too much fabric, even in the smallest size. the quality seems nice, and it looks pretty, but overwhelming. i will say, i think it would work on tail lean people, i have pretty muscular shoulders, so the off shoulder look with that much fabric made me look 30 pounds heavier, no joke. fabric is soft though. give it a try, just not for me...

ref: 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5 in waist.",0
This suit itself is adorable. i usually have to get a size large for length but in this case the cups are way too big. it says light padding but there is no padding. just a giant empty cup. i'm going to order the size medium.,1
"The colors in this cardigan are not what they look like on line. the top is navy and the lower arms are grey. the sweater overall has more punch than pictured. this is a cotton sweater and a great fall layering piece. it will look great with a tee shirt and jeans. it is a long sweater, but not too long as to swallow a smaller person up. i also really like that the front is not too flowy. i am looking forward to wearing this all fall.",1
"This is a pretty everyday piece to add to your wardrobe. the color is a little less pink and more peach than depicted in the photo and the top is just a bit on the short side but i was afraid that if i sized up, it wouldn't give me more length but maybe look boxy instead. i'm 5'7"", 140lbs, 32dd with an athletic build and ordered the small.",1
"This sweater is super cute. it has nice weight to it and is just a nice casual but attractive piece to wear with jeans or white pants. love that it zips and just a really cute pattern of marigold, mint/teal and grey/dark gray.",1
I am usually a size o and ordered and xs ...due to the band in the center (not much give) it was a little difficult to shimmy over my hips but the body fit perfectly when i got passed that part. that being said the cup design is a hot mess. i am a b/c cup size and the top on this could not handle it. i felt fully exposed. i thought maybe if i went a size up i could get a little more coverage. the body felt ok on the small but the cups were still just too small. i still felt to exposed. they are,0
Loved this top when i first saw it online and when it arrived it didn't disappoint at all. dress it up or down.,1
"Am typically a size 0 and could barely get the extra small on, which is a first. was very cute in theory, but i'd suggest sizing up (maybe 2x).",0
"The cups on this suit are  ridiculous.  unless you are going to a nudist beach i do not recommend.  the construction of the suit itself was also vey poor. seams were messed up, a big pull right on the front-- i brought it back. sad because the design was adorable- just poor execution.",0
"I really wanted to love this top! it's cute and fitted- fits well, but just hit me a tad higher than i wanted. i tried a size 2 and it fit perfectly--but with no extra room. i'm 5'5""-34c. normally wear a 2.",1
"Loving this top! feels comfy and casual like a sweatshirt, but pairs great with a pencil skirt or dress pants to wear to work. easy to dress up and down and i get so many compliments on it! it's fraying a tiny bit on the front, but i think that adds to the not-so-precious vibe. i'm 5'10"" 160# and the m works great!",1
"I love this top.  the fit is great for me. i ordered a small. the color is a bit more peach than the pink in the picture,  but still very cute.",1
"This top is really cute for the right body shape.
it is tight around the bust area if you select your size and sizing - you lose the shape.",1
Love the look of these- casual or dressy depending on what you pair with them. they are so comfortable! edgy but relaxed - joggers with a leather look- what more could you ask for?,1
Received a lot of compliments when i wore this sweater. quality is wonderful. only thing i noticed is that it's a little shorter in length then what i was expecting.,1
"I ordered this item before seeing the july 25th review. i ordered in a s and need an xs. now the xs is sold out unfortunately. my waist measures 27"", hips 32"", and i am 5'4"". the material very nice, has elastic for movement and comfort. i would wear this all the time if i had the correct size. it would be cute dressed down or up.",1
"The skirt in person is not like the picture. baggy and runs large. i wear jean size 25 and the xs is two size too loose. there's no pocket which is surprising on a denim. the slit in front makes the skirt  look even loose , no shape near what's in the picture. and there's no petite sizes. i am going to return it.",0
"This suit is the most flattering suit i have owned in a while, as well as the most comfortable! though the suit is not lined, the light wetsuit material holds me in and is supportive, despite the open back and the slight looseness of it. if you do any water sports, i think this is a perfect suit. i did purchase some silicone covers for myself, however, to avoid looking like a farrah fawcett throwback.",1
I also wanted to love this top but sadly had to return it because it is very short and the peplum piece is very wide. it was not flattering at all.,0
"This is the weirdest, greatest material. it feels as soft and as buttery as leather, but doesn't look like leather. it looks more like coated denim. only lighter. and stretchy. so you don't get the vibe you get from the vast majority of vegan leather--thick, rubbery junk trying to masquerade as the real thing.

also gorgeous: the cut. it's straight and slim, but with pleats so hip-less ladies like me look like we have some shape.

i got my regular size, and they fit beautifully, but they are not",1
"Gorgeous flowy dress that's great for three seasons. thank you to the previous reviewers for the fit advice. size small was only available and it fits perfectly on me (i'm an m/l on top). i'm short and will have to hem because even with 3"" heels i kept stepping on the back skirt. bodice opening is wide and gapes too much so i will wear a cami bra or fashion tape or have an additional fastener sewn in. there are bright little balls of red trim and unexpected pops of violet embroidery, adding to t",1
"I ordered the floral version of this swimsuit - what you can't really tell from the images is the darling, lavender stripe design that is in set opposite the floral. it's truly a darling suit, and very well made. the fit is very flattering, with oddly enough a conservative yet sexy appeal. i ordered a medium after reading the ""size up"" recommendations from other consumers - but, i've exchanged it for a small. the cup size was over-exaggerated in the medium - and, i had plenty of breathing room i",1
"This is a very well made sweater. it is a nice weight, great for cool mornings and evenings. i don't think you can dress this up but it is perfect with casual pants and jeans. i found it runs large but that makes it suitable for layering over other tops.",1
"I purchased this skirt on super-sale but i'm hesitant to keep it. it's not poorly made, just not as sturdy as i would expect a skirt of its price. that said, it's cute and comfortable. i wish it came in numbered sizes because the m is snug but i expect the l would be too big. has a good amount of stretch. shows underwear lines. love the style!",1
"I was wondering whether to purchase this top and decided last weekend during the 20% off event, i would splurge!!! i got the m as i'm tall (5'10"") and it does look a little strange on the arms atleast on my body. the sleeve is cut too high for me. i wish it was longer or even a long-sleeved item! the peach-apricot- nude colored fabric is a little uncomfortable and the fabric close to the neck is a different grey from the other sweatshirt pieces. the sweatshirt pieces aren't particularly soft eit",0
I wanted to love this top to go with a pair of red flats i also bought at retailer. but it's almost like a peplum crop top because the cut is short. the peplum piece also flares out rather dramatically. had to return it even though i love other tops from maeve.,0
"This product looks great on the model, but for anyone with a normal body type, the band in the center is way too tight. i'm a 34a and wear a 27 pants and it was huge in the bust and too small in the waist and hips. the violet one looks much more blue in the photograph, it is truly lavender and purple. i really wanted to love this swimsuit, but instead i had to return it, pay for return shipping, and i am out about $20 now. very disappointed.",0
I bought this because i loved it online but in person there is another level to the shirt that i did notice in another picture. i didn't like the second level on me since i am a shorter person. just didn't fit my body quite right.,0
"To be honest, i bought this as a pregnancy top since i can't bring myself to buy actual maternity wear. it is gorgeously made of lovely light material, and i can actually see myself wearing it even after baby. i find the asymmetrical hemline to be really chic - overall a fave.",1
"I loved the lines in this jacket, but ended up returning it because they didn't show up how i expected. the jacket had a surprisingly baggy fit (s on my usual s/4/6) and wasn't quite what i was looking for.",0
"Sooo this adorable blouse is indeed different than pictured. no ruffle, such a bummer, sleeves are much longer, and yes it's teared in the front and back. also the button opening on the back is much longer/larger, in my opinion. i'll most likely keep it, but consider the mentioned if buying.",1
"I really was looking forward to this piece but unfortunately it was too small to even pass through my head nevertheless i couldn't even get both arms in. i got a size small and probably needed a large; but as far as the quality and color, it's really pretty! just go up a size or two if anything and try it out.",0
"I was very disappointed to receive this and to note that the blouse has no ruffle down the front as pictured. there is no ruffle anywhere on the blouse. i am likely still going to keep it because i like the pattern, but the ruffle was what interested me for a cute work blouse and i want other shoppers to know that the blouse actually includes no ruffle when you order it.",0
"This caught my eye, purely by accident as i was in the dressing room. immediately attracted to the pattern, the color, the quality and the shape of the skirt. lo and behold, it turned out to be maeve, one of my favorite designers at retailer. this skirt does not disappoint at all. i normally try to wait for sales to make a purchase, but this is well worth the full retail price. the skirt is very well made. the material is structured but not stiff. i also don't normally like high waisted ski",1
This is quite long on my 5'1 frame but it's wool and will be amazing in the fall and winter. so happy i finally ordered this,1
"I bought this skirt in the store a few months ago, because i anticipated that retailer would sell out of my size considering how great the fit/look of this skirt is. sure enough, they've sold out of the size 2. normally i wear a size 4, sometimes 6, in skirts depending on the cut and where it's from; just last year i bought a skirt from retailer in a size 10! for me, this was a skirt i needed to try on to get the perfect size, but it's absolutely adorable and a great deal at the sale price! it's mod",1
"I wish there were be fewer asymmetrical tops in the store. i see many tops i like until i discover they have an asymmetrical hem and are longer in the back, which i do not prefer.",0
"Even in my usual petite small size, this looked bulky and made me look stumpy. disappointing because the style looks so good in the picture and the material looks to be good quality. i don't even know if going down a size would have helped. as others have mentioned it looks like a frumpy house robe.",0
"There's just nothing special about it. it runs small and the fabric is itchy. the design with button caught my eye, but i didn't like it well enough to keep it.",0
Wish they had more colors avail in my size when i bought this one. you can easily dress it up or down.,1
"Corduroy fabric is historically difficult to fit well....even with stretch added. so imagine my surprise when i tried on the pilcro serif mid-rise corduroy pants in the saffron yellow shade and they fit great! they were long enough as well. i loved them so much that i ordered the aqua shade as well and when that pair arrived, it fit just a nicely as the yellow ones. how wonderful that there is finally a corduroy pant that truly fits well. these are not old lady pants either...how nice!",1
"I ordered first the green, then the grey (in case the green was mismarked.)
so short!!
is this to be in keeping with the ankle pant trend??
anyone who wants a shorter pant could easily hem them. but there is no way to lengthen them.
i held the new pants up to an older pair from previous years. they are a full 2 1/2 inches shorter! wow!
note how in the photo of the golden color pants they barely skim the model's ankle. that's how they are in real life.
i wear these pants in a tall, and live",0
"Big pockets make it look more like a bathrobe than a coat. there are no internal pockets and the loops for the belt are pretty skimpy - just a bit of string. the color is great, but the quality leaves something to be desired.",0
"I saw this top online and fell in love with the overall casual look.
i ordered all 3 colors, and they just arrived........love love love !!!
they are soft, comfortable and a have a very flattering casual fit.
the understated ruffled details add the special ""something"" that is so retailer.
they are sophisticated yet pretty.
the orange is more vibrant in person and is a beautiful shade.
the plum/purple is a rich, unique and pretty color.
the navy is a perfect ""denim"" color.
a fantastic basic",1
"Very boxy top, not flattering on. i will be returning.",0
"These got me so excited for fall. the teal is a color i'm really into right now and was the real reason i decided to order these. when they arrived though, i was delighted to find that they are light weight and have the perfect amount of stretch. the fit is snug, but hugs all the right places and are so comfortable! these will be a staple in my wardrobe. i want to order more colors!",1
"I love this dress, is perfect in every way. no complaints. very pretty colors. will wear it with a belt.",1
These pants are so soft and comfortable!! the colors are great too. can't wait to buy more in other colors!,1
"Unfortunately, does not look anything like in the picture. looks like an oversized house robe. i expected much more but was disappointed. i am definitely returning it.",0
"I am a sucker for a peasant dress. i love anything i can toss with a pair flats and head out the door, but this dress is ridiculous. i look like a schoolmarm. the white bib collar takes this dress into costume territory. i love one september and have many items from the brand that i wear regularly, so i'm bummed that this wasn't what i expected. i knew it would have flow, but it's more billowy than i wanted. stay away unless you want to look like a little girl on the first day of school.",0
"This print/color combination is really pretty. i think it's a little muted compared to the picture, but still very pretty. it is definitely longer than expected - i'm 5'-5"" and it almost touches the floor. will definitely need to wear with heels. colors will actually work in the fall with boots and in spring with heeled sandals. it actually has a shorter underskirt, so there's no accidental show. i really like the dark blue wrap #extra fabric at top# - sits below the waist and will help hide imp",1
"The color of this top is lovely. however, i felt the quality was lacking for the price. the fabric is thin and the top i tried on in the store had some loose threads already. fit was tts for me.",0
"The fabric is incredibly soft and has a good weight to it. this is also pretty warm. it's not a down jacket, but it's as least as warm as a sweatshirt. it fits close to the body in typical bomber jacket fashion. i'm 5'6 155 lbs and went with the large, which fits well. i always find myself wishing bomber jackets were just a tad longer and this is no exception, but i can't really fault the jacket for that, it's true to the style.",1
The arm holes are just weird .. a little too big for me was just 'off'... back it goes.,0
"I have purchased many dresses from retailer for weddings and events.  this is the first time i have been disappointed with the quality.  however, the sleeve on this dress ripped after lifting up my toddler son in the middle of a wedding.  the size 4 seemed to fit perfectly, but the fabric had no give.  it was not overly tight in the bust as i am bra size 34aa.  for the price, i expected better.  the color and style of the dress is gorgeous, so perhaps ordering one size up is the answer. . .",0
"Usually wear s and xs, tried this in s at store but the sides were still lumpy after zipping the size zipper up. if i tried xs it would have looked better but may be bit too tight. the sides of the arm holes were also cut very low. it also has a dusty grey sheen to it that makes it look like old velvet in a bad way. two layers, green on outside, and a polyester beige layer underneath.

but definitely a showpiece that can be paired with a short jacket.",0
A beautiful silk dress - light and cute but not worth the price. this dress is extremely thin and no lined at all. it's very light and i'm afraid would be completely see through.,0
"Super cute blouse- great with a jean jacket, - sleeved or sleeveless. pleating is neat and a nice unique detail, without getting to full. usually a 4 or small in blouses, bought the xs. made this decision based on the arm hole openings, seemed a little large and set low on the small. .",1
"Dress was a disappoint. very thin and cheaply made, not worth the money at all. pictures make it look much better than in real life. top area is also made small so if you are busty, this is not the dress for you.",0
This tank caught my eye in the store yesterday. i was taken by the design contrast of the front and back. the colors are beautiful and rich. i see this as the perfect tank to transition into the fall season. the top does run a little big. i sized down to a medium. i am just under 5'5 and am a 36g.,1
Saw this hanging in the store. it is cute front and back.  it is flattering as well. i plan to wear under a jacket for work and without a jacket at night.  looks amazing with a denim jacket,1
"I don't have a lot of pink or lavender in my wardrobe, but any time i do try a shade like this on i always think it compliments my skin tone and hair color. i generally wear a mauve-ish or coppery eye shadow and the color of this shirt looks beautiful against that makeup too. unfortunately, i just don't find the shape of the top to be flattering. it's really long, so the way the model has it partially tucked looks best but i'm not really thin like her and i have a larger chest... it just doesn't",0
I love this style of tank top with the wider straps. very flattering but yes the armholes are big and i noticed the sizing is different with each color. i normally wear an xs but in the gray and blue i bought s to have a little room. i also bought the black color but the s was huge! i exchanged for an xs so hopefully it will fit better. it had to be ordered. it definitely stretches out as you wear it though.,1
"I purchased this to wear on the same day. it did have a strong smell ! i tried airing but didn't help much so didn't wear. tags are cut so will probably give a try after washing (by hand, my fault for not checking this part). it is a bit over my price range for a casual top, so hoping i'll end up loving it!",0
"The shirt is beautiful, but fits much too small. the stitching limits the space in your shoulders, and the hem too short. a petite frame would be able to pull this off- but i am a 5.10"" medium, and the shirt didn't work in every direction.",0
"I'm in love with these tanks. so in love that i bought four of them (black, grey, blue, and the black motif). they are so flattering on. i love the low scoop neck and the wide straps. the cut is interesting enough to wear the shirt on its own, but also perfect for under a cardigan. i purchased a nearly identical one from retailer (which was made by velvet) several months ago and it was much more pricey. these are a much more affordable option.",1
"This top is very pretty on the hanger. however, i have a curvy bust, and it was incredibly unflattering on my body. boxy, too high of a neckline, unattractive. the plus sides to it are that crochet detailing is lovely, and the color is nice as well. maybe if you have a 1920's frame it would work.",0
"I love the wide straps but it runs small and is short. still great for layering. great, soft material. i hate that it is so tight and short but if i size up them the arm holes would be way too big.",0
"Wow! this skirt blew me away out of the package! i almost had to wonder if i received the right skirt i had ordered! i thought the skirt was mostly an oatmeal isth color , but irl the skirt is predominantly purple with real and beige colors weaved in! the skirt itself is also a fine sweater knit which makes it look more luxurious! i'm thinking this skirt will look awesome in the fall, but might be a bit heavy for some in the summer weather. the skirt is also longer than expected... i'm 5'6"" and",1
"I ordered the black (not yet available ) through my store, as the xs was too big, and we tried ordering xs petite but it was not yet available. so we ordered xxs. (i am 115lbs). it fits nicely, but - as mentioned in previous review - it is thin. not see through in black, but thin. cut is nice though, i still think petite would fit me better i n length, but xxs was good... got a think if i will keep or not as htis is a nice summer basic...",1
"This dress is adorable and professional at the same time. i was worried that the print would overpower me but it's a nice fabric. i'm 5'2"" and the petite small is perfect. i don't like to wear form fitting clothing for work and this fits right for me. plus it's hand washable. i haven't worn or washed it yet but i'll easily wear it to my ""creative professional"" workplace.",1
"I was in the store looking specifically for long sleeved tops that are cute and found this! pretty color pinky purple and my usual xs is perfect. i'm 5'6"", 127 lbs, 34b. love this--definitely unique and feminine. and--no--nary a smell in the mix!",1
"I bought this in size xl and it ran small along the waist & bottom hemline. i'm pear-shaped so it's an awkward fit. i'll wear it tucked in or belted. they used a lot of material in the sleeves & through the top portion. i wish they hadn't made it such a narrow cut along the bottom.

the sleeves are very pretty. the embroidery they used for the cutouts is a little rough & scratchy. since i got it on sale & like the color, i'm keeping it. i recommend trying this on if you can.",0
"Love this tank! prettier shade of yellow in person. love the strap width and length. wish they'd bring back more in lots of colors. i sized up one from my usual size and will have to shorten the length of the strap myself, but it's an easy alteration and is totally worth it! especially good at sale price. i really hope they make more in the style in lots of colors. great find!",1
"I'd been waiting to snatch up this jumpsuit as it looks so cute online, so when it went on sale i ordered it right away. well i was thoroughly disappointed. i agree with some of the other reviewers, the fit is odd, huge on top and too snug on the bottom. being made of flimsy silk it has no give and didn't hang well on my curvy body, being too loose in some areas and too snug in others. also the top is embroidered while the bottom isn't. the material is thin and and it definitely isn't high enoug",0
The picture doesn't do these justice! they are beautiful and a must-have for summer date nights. i am 5'2 and hover between 115-120. i tried on the regular size in-store and they were way too long. so i ordered the xs petite and they fit perfectly! i like to pair them with a flowy top that hangs over the waist band. (not styled like the pic). they literally feel like you are wearing nothing. you'll receive so many compliments - trust me!,1
"I bought a similar tee by velvet by graham and spencer a couple years ago and have been searching for another one ever since. the wide straps are flattering on me because of my broad shoulders. i love the price too, very reasonable. i want one in every color.",1
I bought the fuschia colored tank to wear under a sweater for the fall. great color. fits well.,1
"This item is pretty, the print on the fabric is nice and reminiscent of embroidery, but only the top portion has a few embroidered accents. my issue with it is it's very impractical. the fabric is extremely thin, and you wouldn't want to wear it in any weather below 75 degrees. it's ridiculous to advertise this product for a fall/winter season. the tube top underneath doesn't work very hard to stay up, and isn't a very practical way to hold up the jumpsuit (why wouldnt they just stitch a lining",0
"I have bought 4 of these, but after 1st wash on 2 of them and they were in a lingere bag, there are little holes on the front of each, now they are bum around shirts. if they go on sale i will purchase, but the material needs to be better.",1
Very sheer inexpensive material. even on sale i'm returning it,0
"This shirt smelled so bad when i received it (and i am not at all sensitive to smells). is it from the dye? 
i tried it on anyway. it is shapeless and nothing special. at almost 80 bucks it is so over priced.",0
"Lovely top with details and a unique color. i have read some other reviews and i honestly don't know why it is getting bad reviews. it is linen but not scratchy by any means, like linen it does give with wear, so i recommend sizing down as it does run a little large. with a nude bra you won't see your straps and i would dryel this, no washing of any kind, linen shrinks! overall great top and i was glad i snatched one up.",1
"This top is for someone flat chested and skinny. i really like the styling, color, fabric and everything except that it's not for my body type. i am a 36dd and have a little bit of a stomach... so it makes me look fat from the sides.
the pictures taken on the model are from the front and back - but i will bet she would still look good in it from the sides! will be returning it.",0
"This is a super flattering, cute tank! i've purchased it in several colors because it's such a great fit. somewhat thin material and slightly sheer (especially the white). i like that it has good coverage on the sleeves so that bra straps nor 'side boob/armpit' fat shows. looks great with pilcro capris for a cute, casual summer look! i wish they would come out with even more colors!",1
"The turqoise color is pretty, however, it did smell bad out of the package. i wore it once and it transferred the dye to my skin and white pants, bra and cami! hope it all comes out in the wash. i tried to hand wash the shirt and now have blue hands and a blue tub.",0
"The wide strap style is very flattering. this tank is fitted in my normal size small, it fits like the model in the cobalt blue color. i'm 5'7"" 120lbs. if you want more room, i'd size up. it is low cut, but not inappropriately so. fits like the picture shows.",1
"This shirt had an overpowering vinegar odor when i took it out of the packaging.

the mint green color was appealing but the styling did not look good and the smell was too much.",0
I love this tank! basic but super sexy! i'm an a cub and this tee makes them look a lil bigger so i'll take it!! i bought the dark grey in small and went back for the striped grey and purchased small. i bought the black one too but i feel like the small in black is too big and the xsmall is too small. i'm torn because i want the black to tuck in a pencil skirt.,1
"I took a risk on this one. i wasn't sure if the shirt was more green or more blue. i look better in blue. it turns out that the shirt is a bit more green, but i think it still looks good! i'm 5'3' and 125 lbs. i got a medium. i could have maybe gotten a small, but i like the medium. the shirt has a bit of a vintage look to it, which i like. all in all good.",1
"Lovely color and sweet top, but the fabric was so itchy i couldn't wear it.",0
"I bought 3 shirts in gold, black and red. they arrived larger than expected. after the first wash and air dry they shrunk. i would have been thrilled but they shrunk to be shorter while staying too wide. also my black shirt faded a lot with one wash.",0
I saw the tank at the store and was so glad to try it on. i got the small?i'm in between xs and s (34b) and try to get petites when i can but the small fit great with a longer cut. i bought the green and did not find it sheer. i actually thought it was thicker than most tanks and tees these days. i found the arm holes were fine. i usually need to go with a petite just for this reason but no need to this time. planning on getting a couple of more colors!,1
"Actually you would think just another tshirt but actually with the wide straps it changes it up enough to really be cute.  i like the look it adds.  i really want to get more colors.   i normally wear everything from retailer in small , and even though this fit it was small for a small.  i will keep it but i think i will buy others in medium.",1
I tried this on in-store in white and in grey. it is so super comfy and really cute. i love the wide straps! i ended up getting it in white and black. the grey looked a tad bit more casual than the white and black tanks.,1
"I ordered the red motif in size m based on reviews this top runs small and it is too big. i'm 5'7""/ 34c /132 lbs and usually a size s in this brand. this top was large through the body and the arm openings were huge. i washed it and dried it but it still fits a bit large, it did wash up well though, no pilling.",1
"Fits large, wrinkles easily and not what i expected for the price.",0
This is a cute top but i wore it for around 5 hours and lo and behold i had smurf skin. i did not sweat in it but the color transferred to my underarm area and bra and it did not come off in the shower!! i guess it's going to have to wear off. thank goodness it was not a hot day!! i hope that i can return it.,0
"I like this top but unfortunately i will be returning. it's way too long. the color is pretty as is the design minus the length. it makes it look frumpy. maybe if they offered it in petite or if you're taller, it would work for you.",0
"I have to return this top. the armholes are huge. the material is on the thin side and not what i expected. i can't size down. i got an xxs. maybe if i had been able to order a petite, it would have fit better. i ordered the red and i liked the color.",0
"I too will be returning this sweater. love the style, shape and fabric, but after one wearing it has pilled terribly and now looks old and cheap.",0
"This is a thick jacquard fabric and the colors are stunning. this would be best for very thin petties or tall women. i'm 5'4"", 125#, 27/4, and it was just too much fabric so my waist looked thick. the length was great though. sad it didn't work out",1
"I absolutely loved this the minute i saw it. the quality is impeccable, and the fit is amazing. i will agree with the other reviewer in that the fabric is very thick (back to the quality of this piece, amazing!!) and some women may not like the extra ""bulk"" to that part of the body. however i'm still on the hunt now for the perfect white top to go with it. thank you retailer for always providing unique, quality pieces :)",1
"Unfortunately, this dress is shaped like a sack and has no shape to speak of. i have sent it back for a refund :( too big, too shapeless.",0
"Love the silhouette and coziness of the fabric. for the first few wearings, i was in love. then it began to pill horribly . . . would not recommend. my mother said, ""that's going to pill up."" and i ignored her. and she was right.",0
The fabric is soooo thick. the pattern is very spring/summer but the heavy thick and lined fabric says otherwise. the pockets are great and the fit was true to size but that fabric killed it for me,0
"Looks beautiful in the photo and the color in person is beautiful but it runs so so large that i think even an extra small would be too large for me. just for comparison, and i wish all reviewers would include this, i am 5'5"" and weigh 120 pounds. i ordered a medium which a small to medium is my usual size but i ordered the medium because i wanted to have room to wear something under it. i could have worn two sweatshirts under this sweater. unfortunately i have returned it.",0
"Wanted to love this dress, bit it wasn't to be. strange fit, and doesn't drape nicely, as in the photo. also, the blue color was much darker in person. wouldn't recommend.",0
"So the dress is interesting. has an asymmetrical wrap look, short, sexy length (i'm 5'3"" and the petite barely covers my assets), and a neckline that implies sexy without actually displaying the girls- it crosses over and stays closed, but looks sexy and plunging. but the shoulders are what make it look matronly. they're wide- from neck out to the outer edge of my shoulder/upper arm. they show no shoulder at all, which is really an odd design when the rest of the dress is sexy-ish. i looked back",0
"I bought the gray and white to take on a trip. i wore it nearly every other day. looks good layered with a cami or short sleeved t-shirt. also threw on a blazer one chilly night and it looked nice enough to have a dinner out.came home and bought it in red and white and solid white. true to size. not clingy, not baggy and comes down just long enough to cover the tummy.",1
I was looking for a casual dress for quick errands that was trendy but comfy.  this dress had a lot of potential [i was drawn to the print]  but the material is awful. so thin and scratchy! immediately went back.,0
"I really, really wanted to love this dress. the v-neck plunge is way too deep. i needed to pin it to keep it closed. the blue color was pretty, and the front was flattering, but the back was not. it was super clingy in the back and didn't hang in a flattering way. sadly, i sent it back.",0
"I love this sweater. i bought it on sale in maroon and it is the most comfortable sweater ever. i like to wear it with leggings. it has a nice, oversize fit and is perfect for ""fat"" days. or any day.",1
This jacket is cute and comfy!,1
"Pictures do not do this top justice. looks much cuter in person !
it caught my eye right away in the store.
perfect top for when the weather starts getting a little cooler.",1
"Just a ginormous, shapeless shirt. runs extremely large. i am normally a medium to large in shirts and the medium was huge. i can only imagine an xs would work and i am no xtra small!",0
I loved the contrasting design of this sweater. i loved it even more when it arrived. its soft and true to size. i received so many compliments which sealed the deal.,1
It's maybe a bit longer than i'd like but cute-great with slacks or dresses!,1
"This coat is very soft and flattering in design. good quality and very comfortable. i usually wear a small which is what i got and it fits well. if anything, it is a little snug across the shoulders when i reach forward, so if you plan on wearing a heavier layer underneath, go up a size.",1
"I bought the ivory in my usual size xs and the fit is flattering and quality is good. it is a good weight for spring, summer and fall. i love that it is a natural cotton/linen blend. the turquoise was not available in my size initially but when it restocked for a short time i ordered it, also! i know i won't be disappointed. beautiful sweater with great details.",1
This would be a great blouse for flat chested person. i am a size 12 and busty. i ordered an xl and it was ridiculously tight across the chest and the fabric is see through. you would need to wear a cami under it.,0
This is a really lovely jacket - silky soft fabric in a pretty color and quality construction throughout. i am so sad that it runs very small - especially in the arms and across the chest. i will be returning it .,1
"This top is exactly as described. it can be casual with jeans or dressed up for evening wear. i would have kept it but it was slightly tight across the chest. i am 5' 1 1/2"" tall, 112 lbs & purchased a petite small. my bra size is a 34a.",1
"I was really excited about this romper and when it arrived it looks just like the picture. the torso was abnormally long and i get this is supposed to be a relaxed fit but it sagged way too much for my liking. i'm 5'9"", 32c and i wear 28 size pants, usually i struggle with too short of a torso in romper/jumpsuits but not this one. i ordered a medium and felt like it was way too big. i probably could have gone down a size but i wasn't loving it enough to try. the fabric is nice but the tiny clasp",0
Just bought this weekend and had to size down. i'm usually a small in jackets and went with the xs. retailer has had this style for the last few years and i've missed out so finally was able to buy before they sold out!! well worth the price point. i think it will be a very versatile jacket. for sizing reference i'm 5'7 and 135lbs.,1
"Cashmere is soft as a feather, yet warm, easy to wear and the pointelle stitches are lovely. i feel lovely wearing this and i'm really not that kind of ""lady"". so, if you imagine a side of yourself wanting to try out feeling lovely, bite the bullet and buy this cardigan. it does run small in my bust area, but all the rest fits well.",1
I love this jacket and can't get enough of it. it has side pockets as well as the buttoned-pockets. i love the cinched waist option for a more fitted look.,1
"I am 5'5. 125 pounds, size 4-ish (sometimes a 4, sometimes a 6), athletic build. these pants fit great except they are pretty large around the waist, about 2 extra inches of space. i don't think the problem would be fixed by sizing down since only the waist was large. i will need to get them tailored.",1
"I just received this beautiful suit. i have purchased a boyleg from seafolly before and loved it!
this color way is totally different. it is a white background with a floral pattern that is not over the top.
i am a 32 dd and wear a clothing size 4. i purchased the 6. this suit definitely will accommodate small bust too.
my sister is a 34 b size 4 clothing and it fit as well.
way to go retailer with another winner!!!!",1
"Good quality dress, except the lining is very sheer and thin. the inner strap of the lining ripped when i tried it on, so be careful putting it on. once on, it fits true to size, the lining is nice to have, so i kept it even though the strap ripped. if you are on the fence between sizes i would recommend going smaller to avoid having this style of dress look maternity on you.",1
"I absolutely fell in love with this dress when i saw it online, but unfortunately, it just didn't fit right. the bust and bodice not designed for curves, and the dress just didn't fit correctly, i think it would work better on very slim figures.",0
"I adore this top! the tencel fabric feels like a nicely worn out denim shirt that's been worn for years. it is a versatile piece that can be worn year round.  even if the sleeves are pulled onto the shoulders,  it still works and looks just fine. i'm broad in the shoulders, and we'll endowed,  but the large was perfect.",1
"Agree with previous reviewer. i am usually an xs p in this brand (5'3"" 115 lbs) but i could not get the internal slip over my head. the chest area was fitted (i am a 32b) but then the skirt was very full and loose. i could have cut out the slip, but worried it would be see through and just not worth it at full price.",0
"I bought this dress to wear to my low-key backyard rehearsal dinner. the dress it's self is beautiful, good quality, and a perfect summer maxi. however, it was way too big. i'm 5'6, 118 lbs, i typically wear an xs/0 and felt like i was swimming in fabric. i loved the style and make of the dress, so i choose to get it tailored.",1
"I purchased these in january and today i am going back to retailer to request a refund; the fabric on the inner thighs are absolutely thread bare. i am 5'6 and wear a size 28. they fit comfortably with great stretch, but apparently the fabric is so cheap that if your thighs should happen to touch, you will wear holes through the thighs in very short order.

first they started piling, which i had never a pair of pilcro pants do before, and within 2 washes i could actually see through the f",0
"Quality piece except the fit is way off. i have a 32 c bust and long narrow torso, larger on the bottom. i ordered the small. i frequently wear a small/extra small on top and i was busting out of this in the chest area. however, the fit then flares way out from the torso and it just looked dumpy and overpowered my 6 foot frame. i marked it as running small, which it does on top, but then it runs very large on bottom. wanted it to work, but didn't.",0
"It stays on .... i mean off the shoulders. the price is shocking, love the low price, but by no means id cheap. really love this little beauty",1
"I've been looking for the perfect white eyelet maxi, feels like a perfect summer staple...but sadly this was not it. quality isn't great which is surprise on a $168 price tag. top of dress is lined but cheaply so it's somewhat see through. the dress was returned.",0
"I really wanted to love these, i bought them in a rush because i needed to replace my skinny jeans asap. they were a little long and didn't quite hug my calves but i figured with hemming they would be fine. i was told they wouldn't stretch out much. well, they fit great at the waist but the legs are now huge on me and i can't get them to shrink. wish i spent a little more on a different skinny jean. too late to return, so my hoping to be going out jeans are now lazy day jeans.",0
"I love seafolly boyleg bathing suits. i find them very flattering and just universally appealing. this one has beautiful summery design as well. i found it to be running slightly smaller than plain colored editions of this suit. i normally wear size 6 (us size) of this suit, but this particular design 6 was too small and had to exchange for 8(us) which fits perfect.",1
I love these jeans. they can be dressed up or dresses down. super cute with tall boots or loafers. i wear them all the time.,1
These are form fitting and have a great wash. the size runs large so i would say consider to go down one size than you usually wear. the bottom tapers so they are great to wear wtih flats or can easily fit into boots.,1
This dress is so pretty. the tulle underskirt was a fun surprise and the subtle striping in the dress so classy. the dress is true to size. my main concern was making sure the top part would fit around my chest. it fits perfectly.,1
I purchased this dress in the store and then realized i could get a petite size. i ordered it in a pm but had to return it. i reordered it in ps and it's perfect. i love it for a casual evening out of wearing around town in the summer. it's supper figure flattering.,1
"Gorgeous! this dress fit so well and it super flattering. i got it in green and the colors are just lovely. i had to get it hemmed because i'm short and i couldn't find it in petite, but definitely worth the extra cost. i love, love love it.",1
"Just received two, the red and the black. the black is a great print, very versatile. both run large, but the black most significantly so. the red is close enough to fitting to keep. the black shows my bra b/c it is so large and the armholes cut far too deeply. (the red also shows a fair amount of the armpit area, but (barely) covers my bra.

the material is somewhat thinner than expected, but not so sheer that a skin-toned bra wouldn't be sufficient.",1
"The print on this is gorgeous, and it's incredibly comfortable. ultimately, i didn't buy it because the length was weird for me (i'm 5'7""); it just looked strange, like it was cutting me off at a weird point.",1
"I ordered this pullover in green, size large. the color is lovely and the fabric feels great. however, it was tight (even though i often wear a medium). unfortunately it will be going back.",1
"Cute top in theory...ended up looking a little sloppy. the sleeves are a bit too ""blousey"" for my taste and i really wanted the lace-up to be cuter, somehow. still a cute top, received several compliments, but not for me.",0
I normally don't care for rayon clothing but the fabric feels nice and it is flattering in the way it fits. i got my usual medium and it fits well. it has a nice drape and is not see through.,1
"I bought the black and love it. i bought both the medium and large but am going to keep the medium. it was plenty roomy. i'm 5'2"" and about fluctuate between 125-130 lbs. i usually wear a medium or large in retailer-wear but i like things roomy. have to hide a little extra these days!",1
"I would not recommend these pants if you have a curvy or athletic figure. these pants seem to be cut straight up and down. the fabric is not soft, the color is slightly more muted in person, and they are not as relaxed as they appear to be on the model.",0
"It just isn't that flattering on me. it looks kind of old and dingy, even though it's brand new. it fits fine, but doesn't do much to highlight my curves. it just kind of hangs there. the length is somewhat awkward (i bought the petite version). maybe it would look good on someone tall and skinny, like the model. it's gathered around the stomach area and longer in the front, which reminded me of maternity wear. it does appear to be pretty well made; top part is lined. overall it's not terrible,",0
"This dress is the perfect length and so comfortable! it's conservative enough to wear to work as a teacher but also so cute! i'm 5'6"" and the large hits right above my ankle. medium fit as well but i wanted a little extra room in the torso.",1
This top was much more fitted than expected and was not flattering. i would not recommend.,0
"This is really a cute top, nice fabric, the print (the version i bought) is lovely though the colors are different than pictured. the problem for me is that i am 5'8"", 36b with a longer torso and the proportions were just wrong on my body. the blouse does not have much shape at all and fell a bit too short for my liking, especially in the front. it hit at hip level, as in photo, but would look so much better if it had been a couple inches longer. looking at the other reviews i see that most of t",0
"The material was thin, showed every lump you'd rather hide and clung to the body. even the sleeves were tight. looked inexpensive.",0
I saw this top and loved the pattern. meadow rue is one of my favorite brands for tops at retailer. the pattern is lovely and the fit it tts. this top is comfortable for running errands and can be dressed up too. very versatile for spring.,1
"Got this dress in the blue and cream and it's gorgeous. i love that it's work and date night appropriate, but so comfy. i am 5'4"" but have very short legs, so it's hard to find a maxi dress or skirt that doesn't drag on the ground. this floats beautifully above my ankles - a little lower than on the model, but still high enough that i am totally comfortable wearing the dress without heels. i got the small and it fits great. the print is lovely - the cream fabric is speckled in gray dots in some",1
"The turquoise print is absolutely stunning. i love the feel of the fabric, the drape",1
This dress is more adorable on then sitting on the hanger. the material clings to all the right places and feels really good. i must say this is one of the most comfortable dresses i have ever put on. would never tell from the photo that this dress is so adorable. if you like a fitted dress in the waist and bust that subtly accentuates your curves - try it. adorable!,1
"Wearing these for the first time today. the way the pants are made is the way a pair of quality pants should be. the fabric is gorgeous; the fit is excellent. the tone on tone flower is subtle but visible and creates a lovely pattern. the denim treatment at the ankle and waistband is a nice added touch. true to size, too. these are not your run of the mill above the ankle pants - they're something special and worth the money...the fact that i did get them on sale makes it an even better purchase",1
"1. this looks so cute on the model, doesn't it? i have no idea where you wear a suit with hot pants, but it looks cute.

2. that said, keep in mind the model is probably 6 feet 10 inches tall. i'm 5 feet 6 inches tall, and this jacket came down to my knees. i'm not kidding. the 3/4 length sleeves were at my wrist, so more like 7/8 sleeves.

3. i'm normally a size 12 in cartonnier jackets, but this only comes s, m or l. the medium is really a size 10, which was too tight across the shoulders and",0
"I ordered an xxs and it is extremely short in length. another customer had a similar review, but i still took a chance that it would fit well. the sides of the shirt have slits, and because the shirt is too short, it shows the skin on my hips. the rest of the shirt fit fairly well, but i'll still need to return this top.",0
"I was really looking forward to these tees working, after reading the reviews. unfortunately, they had slits on the sides that came up higher than i was comfortable showing my sides just above my jeans. trying to keep it age appropriate.",0
"I got this i n regular xs (i am xsp or xxsp), so it fit fine considering is boxy. it is very cute and delicate so despite being casual, it gives a nice ""dress-up"" kick to any jeans, shorts, capris. im very happy with this top and like it very much and definitely recommend it to everybody. just be careful since is delicate
:-)",1
"I ordered this dress in raspberry, the color is beautiful in person. i am usually a petite size 2, and it fits perfectly. the only thing about this dress that might drive me crazy is that it seems to wrinkle easily. other than that, i think it's a great dress for summer!",1
I so wanted to love this jumpsuit but unfortunately the fit is so off. it runs small and the crotch is to high. the color is beautiful and the design is great. it's really sad i waited two months for this and it was definitely not worth the wait.,0
"I am 5'2"" and i typically wear a 2 or a 2p. lately i've been finding that petite is just a little too short to wear with wedges so i often order a 2 as i did in this dress. it fits well and it's flattering. my two complaints are that it gets wrinkly fast and looks sloppy. yes, linen is a wrinkly look and that's normal for linen but somehow this dress just looks sloppy to me. more importantly, while wearing for the first time, i realized that the seams on the side were very lightly sewn and there",0
"I have to agree that the fit is unfortunate. i am using a size 2 in retailer and most dresses. i knew to size up based on reviews here. i tried the size 4 and i could barely button the top. the waist fit fine and the underarms was fitted nicely to the body. i sized up to a size 6 and the dress was oversized in the top, with gaping armholes. too bad because the color is beautiful and the style is adorable.",0
"Runs small. i'm usually a size sm for retailer clothing (for reference, i'm 5'4, 129lbs, 36b). the tie around the waist of this dress is not a functional tie that you can relax a bit to give yourself more room around the waist. i could not fasten the buttons to close the dress on the size 8. the size 10 fit enough to fasten the buttons but there was a lot of extra fabric and the arm holes were very large. pretty, vibrant colors but size up and be warned of the large armholes.",0
This top looks great and feels great. got lots of compliments when i wore it for thanksgiving. i pretty plan to wear this for every holiday event this year and will layer it with sweaters and scarves to mix it up.,1
"This is a really adorable top!normally i shop online, but ended up in a store today. i bought it instantly, but never would have purchased this based upon the pictures. as all the other reviewers have said, this does run small and you need to size up, especially if you are busty for your size. i am a 4 or a small  (34c) in just about everything, but had to go to a medium. the sleeves attach too far out on the front of the top, restricting arm movement. thankfully, i didn't see a significant size",1
"This dress is everything i imagined it would be. lightweight, flattering on my hourglass shape, and comfortable. i am a true 4p in retailer dresses (5'4"" 32d, 27 inch waist, 28 denim size) and purchased this dress in a 6 regular. i imagine the petite size would be way too short, as the regular size hit about 3 inches above my knee. might be a problem for taller girls. definitely size up on this one to avoid button gaping.",1
"Love this top.
the fit is perfection!
the fabric is wonderfully soft.
i ordered the green, love this color.
will be ordering it in the grey also..
fits very true to size.",1
"I bought this sweater the minute i saw it, and waited for over six weeks for it to come off of back order (it was further delayed from even what i was told when i first ordered it). 
i was beyond excited when it finally arrived and wore the sweater the day after i received it... i had a long flight and thought it was the perfect option for keeping comfy on a plane. 
i was so disappointed that by the time i got off my flight four hours later, the sweater had not one, not two, but three differen",0
Gorgeous colors and great shape for a mini dress. stunning on. the only con is how low the back goes. a bra alone underneath is not possible. will need to wear with a finer shirt underneath.,1
I wanted to love this dress because the fit is so flattering and the color is so great however i could not get the button along my bust to lay flat. normally this can happen if the fit is too tight around the bust but i promise there was still plenty of room. the fabric just bent in a way that left a gaping hole at my bust. unfortunately it's going to have to go back.,0
"This top is beautiful in the model shot, but average in person. it ran really small, i usually take a medium in retailer tops and ordered this in a medium. it barely fit over my chest, and was pretty short (i am 5'7""). also, the material is very thin, not so much that you can see your undergarment, but if you get cold everyone will know it. also, for the price, i expected a sturdier fabric. i would recommend holding out for sale, if you are interested in this top.",0
"Normally, hd in paris brand is spot on for their dresses. this dress is a big thumbs down. as most of these reviewer's and myself point out, the large arm holes do not allow you to wear a regular bra because you don't just get a peak of your bra, you get to see the whole side of it. secondly, the bust of the dress would work only for an a-cup bra, too small for the average woman. the only bright spot with this dress is the brilliant colors available and the quality of the fabric itself - excelle",0
"This dress is lovely fabric, generaly nicely tailored, but weirdly large around armholes, which gap. i'm sending it back. also this 'red' is more like a fuschia.
 dress was generally a a bit too big on top, oddly both too long in the torso, and the shoulders cut too far in--they didn't cover bra straps--as well as unattractively large armholes. you can even see it on the model. i i'm a size 10 to 12, fairly busty but not extremely, and with a slightly short torso, which is party the problem (th",0
"Fyi the neck does have a hook and eye closure so there is room to get it on and off. the fabric is not stretchy. the lining is a nice navy. however, the sleeves are not lined. the cut outs have a beautiful blue lace behind it. it hit me at my waist. i'm 5' 3"" , 118#. i loved this top. worked with a pair of the new essential skinny trouser by retailer, and the nansen pointelle cardigan in yellow. this also paired well with a pair of rust colored skinny pilcro with a long necklace.",1
"First off, i adore this jumpsuit.  i love the mixed stripes and i love that the fabric is structured, textured and substantial.  and for me, the xs fits perfectly, however the sizing is way off from standard sizing. i'm 5'2"", 110, 24.5 waist, 32.5 hips, and usually 00p-0p, and this is fitted on me.  the wide legs aren't too wide like most wide legs (which wear me instead of vice versa) and the structure of the fabric make this piece so flattering for petite ladies.  if you are petite, this jumps",1
"Tried this on just for fun today and ended up taking it home in the glorious blue. many have commented on the sizing issue. for reference i am 5'5, 120 lbs, 32a, slender athletic build. i bought a size 2 and it fits like a dream. no large arm holes, no gaping buttons  and the length is perfect. yes it will wrinkle, it's linen. that's part of the look. i feel this will fill a void in my closet that was missing. i was wearing flat ankle wrap espadrilles when i tried it on and it looked super cute.",1
"I agree with others that this top runs small. i am usually a 2/4 in retailer tops and the small was very tight around the chest area. however, it looked so cute on! i wanted to buy it so badly, but it just didn't work for me. the design is absolutely adorable but i could not lift my arms without the whole top riding up. they did not have a medium in the store so i couldn't see if a larger size would work. overall, such a cute top, just not appropriate for someone my age or practical for someone ch",0
"I pretty much am in agreement with the first, original reviewer on here. big disappointment, especially if you have hips and are busty.

pros:
- great breathable fabric.
- cute look overall.
- sash in front brings it all together.
- buttons are hidden under a panel of fabric, which is a nice touch.

cons:
- runs very small in the bust. normally, i can wear a 10 or 12 with most of retailer's stuff. i tried on a 12 and it fit everywhere with entirely too much room i",0
I really loved this dress in the store when i tried it on the color and fabric were perfect for summer but once i got this home i noticed the placket wouldn't lay flat across the bust like shown in pictures. when i went up a size it was too large under the arms so this one will sadly have to go back to the store.,0
"On a positive note the dress was very well made, great quality as usual from retailer. however. this dress looked like a sack, i believe it may have been the combination of the drab color and the sack like shape. very plain and unflattering. for reference i am 5 5 140lbs 34c ...so i do have a shape it just did nothing for me. it had to go back.",0
"Thick material and cute design. i am typically a size 2 and the small in this fit but was snug in the crotch and just zipped at the waist there is not much if any stretch. i am 5'6"" with a 26 1/2 in waist so that was unexpected. it does have cinchers at the waits but they are more for aesthetics than functionality. it is a very cute design and the fabric is nice as well as the direction of the stripes.",1
"I have to be honest, i wear this away from the pool more than to the pool. it is extremely lightweight and comfortable, making it the perfect loungewear to tackle this california heat, and the style is fabulous- love the hassles and beads on the ties.",1
"Great fit, easy to dress up or down, lovely shade of blue--this will be my default dress this summer.",1
"Always looking for sweaters that are wearable in south florida, stumbled upon this gem. from the front gorgeous silvery gray, soft sweater and stunning open back with romantic silky black bow details. bows will hide bra easily underneath. so comfortable, classy and sexy.",1
"I needed this dress as soon as i saw it on a mannequin in the store. unfortunately, when i tried on my usual size (4 regular), the armholes were so big that you'd be able to see my bra no matter what. i purchased a 4 petite online later that day. it fits perfectly! i received so many compliments on this dress. a few issues though: (1) this dress wrinkles like crazy. i know it's linen, but i looked like a mess after wearing it for just a few hours. definitely don't wear it to work and expect to l",1
"I received this dress in the mail yesterday. right away, i noticed the coloring wasn't quite the same as it appears in the images online. in person, the hints of brown appear more bronzy and shiny, as opposed to more muted. i was willing to look past that, but then i tried it on. i ordered a small, which is my typical size in retailer dresses. it ran quite large and was way to long for me (i am 5' 4''). overall, between the coloring and sizing, this dress wasn't a hit for me.",0
My friend and i bought the same dress we love it so much we get so many compliments great purchase,1
"The reviews i read scared me a little about this top being super cropped. it is on the short side, but will be adorable with shorts and pants that aren't low cut. the multi-textured fabric is gorgeous!",1
"It's a beautiful lace designed tank top in a vibrant navy blue; however, the lace on the hemlines were snagged.  the top was much shorter than i had anticipated.  i'm returning it to the store, unfortunately.",0
"As the other reviewer said, this top is pretty short. nice design but i wish it was a little longer, and i am short... i tried on xxs regular, xs petite and xs regular.

xxs was closest to flattering around the top part (shoulders, cehst), but stil la bit short. the petite was jsut too short and xs regular, a bit longer, but a little loose... os hte fit jsut ddind't work. i may wait for sale on this, but probably something beter wil lcome along.

great for those who want to show their assets",0
"This is dress is great for an occasion - such as a wedding.

i wanted to keep this dress for such occasion - but there were 2 drawbacks. i ordered the dress online and when i opened the package, there it had some sort of oil/petroleum based product smell. the other drawback is the hips - it just flared out more than i wanted. i think that a belt would have solved that, but i usually don't find belts in my size.

as for the fit, it is true to size. i'm a true petite and the 00p fit great!",1
"I saw this dress worn on the street and thought it was lovely, the perfect work dress. i then found it in the store and my size was already sold out, so i visited another retailer, and another to find it. unfortunately the color blocking on the chest was not very flattering for me, it seemed to overly accentuate it. i am 5'9"" a 36 dd size 12.
the colors, the fabric are all wonderful. but this dress is not for me.",0
"My title perfectly describes my attitude toward this sweater. the print is super cute and the price point is great, but this sweater was so itchy that i couldn't even keep it on for longer than a minute. it may be okay with a long sleeve underneath, but don't even think about wearing it by itself!",0
Unless you have the body of the model - tall and very thin and wear a really small size - don't even think about getting this dress! it's literally a heavy sack. it hit right above my knee in the front and basically mid-calf in the back. the material is nice but it's an awful shape!,0
"This dress will take you through fall, winter and spring. i love all the stitching and design detail. it has a nice swingy skirt that is quite a bit longer in the back.",1
"Given that i am petite with thighs (take a size 6p or 28p) these were not for me! the run small, are really tight from the thigh up, run longer that a petite should and are fairly thin. on top of that the zipper and hook in the back are really inconvenient. i was looking for something i could wear to work, and these were not the right style for that. plus they seemed cheaply made, like they wouldn't stand the test of time. i imagine if you are tall and skinny like the model, they would look good",0
"There were no reviews when i purchased this dress. from the picture with the model, the dress looks to be a straight shift dress. i received mine yesterday and the dress flairs out and isn't straight. it is also pretty large. i ordered a medium as the smalls were sold out and i'm not sure i will keep it. still on the fence. dress is shorter than pictured as well. sleeves are shorter than shown. now, after having seen the dress and looking at the online picture, i think the model is holding her a",0
Material is heavy enough to provide warmth on a crisp day or evening.  add poncho or large warm scarf to keep colder temps @ bay. sure wish this came in blk. i bought mauve & just love it!,1
"I really wanted to like this sweater. it was featured in the dressing room and i am a sucker for animal prints. the dog print is unique, a ""mossy"" fuzzy print, and the grey really shows off the dog print. i like regular xs because i like the fitted look (i am 5ft2in, 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips), the hem falls at my upper hip and the sleeves fall a bit pass my wrists. but, if you do not wear a turtleneck under it, you will scratch all day long. the designer should try on the fabric before selling it!",1
"I was excited to order this sweater. when it arrived, the green didn't stand out as much as the picture here. it also felt too itchy. i usually wear either very soft wool or wool with cashmere because i can't stand plain thick heavy wool. this one was just too itchy for me, it is going back.",0
"I ordered a six 6 petite. the pant leg was still very long. and if i have it tailored it will not preserve the whole point of these pants having a flare. this is a slim fit. i have heavy thighs and this was not for me. i'm 5' 120 lbs. also the tag warns that the fabric may leave color on lighter clothing. which i don't get, because it's spandex blend. also wasn't too hip in the zipper on the back.",0
"Okay, so this top has its redeeming qualities, i promise! which is why i gave it 3 stars when i really wanted to give it two. but it's just not worth 2 because i'm sure it works for some people and the quality is just impeccable. for people who purchase this, it will last forever. it's sturdy cotton, not thin like many retailer tee materials. the lace detail and texture is on point and the neckline is very nice. it's a great looking top. my issue though, wasn't with the bust as other reviewers hav",0
"I just scored this dress the other day and i don't regret it for a second. the bodice is beaded with some sea-foam green beads and they are sewn on really well, so i am not worried about dropping them all night. from the pictures, i couldn't tell if this was going to look like a cotton skirt or i fit would be chiffon looking-it is neither. it has a shimmer to it which makes this a more dressy looking dress than i was originally anticipating-i thought it was going to be an everyday wear type of d",1
Got this shirt in black so i can wear it to work.  more personality than a plain t-shirt but still comfortable.  got lots of compliments.,1
"Unfortunately, i am not toned enough to truly show off this beautiful blouse. armholes are cut in a bit too far for my 60 year old arms. was hoping for a pop of color as a basic sleeveless top to layer under sweaters and jackets for traveling, but the neckline wasn't layering as i had hoped. i am only 5'2"" but want a bit more length.
i think this blouse is best worn uncovered as shown, on a toned body that does not require the longer length i prefer. seems to be well made, sadly i must return.",1
"The photo doesn't do it justice. the detail on the neckline is adorable and looks fantastic with jeans. texture is light and gauze-y, but i don't find it too see-though. sizing was tough- i'm 5'10 but thin on top- usually between xs & s, and went with the xs on this (ordered both to try), sacrificing some length for a more flattering width. great for the sale price!!!",1
"First, it's huge. i'm not big busted but it's so roomy that i looked like i was pregnant. not exactly what i was going for. nice color and soft fabric but would only work if you plan to tuck it in--and i'm short waisted so no tucking for me. back it went.",0
"This top is on the boxy side but the design is cute and i love the pink color. the problem i had with this shirt is the huge arm holes. one side you could see the top of my bra, the other side was below the side of my bra. you could also see the inside back of the shirt through this arm hole, it was that big. this went back, will not re-order. i usually order xs or xsp, this was an xsp.",0
This is a great blouse for all shapes!   you can wear it under a suit or with jeans!,1
"This blouse was so cute, i really wanted to love it. as others mentioned, there is something wrong with the fit. i'm not a large person, but the top was tight even though i ordered a medium and a small.",0
Received this product with a gaping hole in it. very disappointed in the quality and the quality control at the warehouse,0
"I liked this top (in black), but it didn't fit me well. had to return.",0
I wear a lot of solid dark colors for work so i liked this was dark blue but had more pop than the basic navy. able to pay it up with other colors too. the sides are a little shorter so have to watch throughout the day so belly isn't showing. not a bid deal overall.,1
So unflattering! really disappointed. made me look 6 month pregnant and i'm a petite size 2.,0
"Lost some extra weight, and decided to venture into styling territory i haven't tried in years. bubble hems will never flatter my thick midsection, but the drawstring with tassel ties make the hemline easily adjustable.

size: i'm currently between a small, and xs. the armholes appeared to be on the small side, so i ordered a small. i'm 5'5"" tall, ~130 lbs, 34d, 35-29-37, long torso and narrow across the shoulders. 

fit: the top is tts. the length hits slightly above hips. i didn't need to",1
"I really loved this top. however, i couldn't get it on. i tried on a medium (my usual size.) it's not that it was too small. something else is wrong with it. the large was way too big. too bad, i really wanted this look.",0
"This shirt looked cute until i tried it on... worst fit ever. im thin, and this style of top is usually quite flattering, but this one missed the mark big time.",0
"I love this top! the color is quite unique (a reddish color), but the cut really makes it stand out. i love the square neckline. i feel it accentuates my bust without showing too must breast. i notice a number of other reviewers had an issue with the tightness around the bust: this top looks like it would have ample stretch in the photograph; however, in person you can see that the embroidered area does not have any stretch. for me, this was not an issue, as the top suited my body type well rega",1
"I love this top and find it flattering, but the black and white polka-dotted motif that i purchased definitely has navy blue in it -- not black. kind of disappointing that the color description was so inaccurate.",1
"This top was too big for me. 5'4, 135lbs and ordered xxs. fit was fine and wanted it too work, but too overwhelming on me as well. will be going back.",0
"This shirt is very comfortable to wear, mostly because the buttons are well placed. many button down shirts bother me because they gape open at the bust area, but the buttons on this one are placed at just the right spot.",1
"I thought this would look great with skirts, but all my skirts are too dressy for this t-shirt. that's really all it is -- a nothing-special t-shirt. and it runs so big! i'm usually a large or xl in tops, but for this one i bought a medium, and it's still too big. i think a small would have been fine. but, as i mentioned, it doesn't go with any of my skirts, so it's not worth looking for a small.",0
"I didn't know what to put for ""runs small, true to size, or runs large,"" but it required me to put something...i first ordered the xl, and it was ridiculously gianormous. the next time, i ordered a large. i thought the large would either be a perfect fit or still too large, based on how the xl had fit. the large was too tight! i could not believe it! it is too bad, for i love the design and color of this top! i ordered it in the muted red color. if you can find a size that works for you, go for",0
"I love this blouse! i get so many compliments when i wear it. i can't wait for warmer weather to pair it with my coral short skirt from retailer. currently, i wear it with a pair of slim cream colored pants, and flats. it works great! it is a little on the short side, but it just adds to the tailored look of the cut. however, if you're taller than 5'5"" or 5'6"", i would expect it to be much shorter on you (you've been warned ;)

I love this! the contrast in much prettier in person.,1
"The quality of the garment is high--a nice substantial yarn and a pretty crochet pattern, but the cut was totally off for me. i'm usually an xs/s, and was swimming in the xs. the arms in particular were huge and drapey, and the whole thing just hung on me (for reference, i'm 5'4"", 120 lbs).",0

"The fit of the top is true to size, but i really don't like the taupe terrycloth-like sweatshirt under the white lace. the white lace is bright white and seems very sturdy, but it makes the sweatshirt underneath look very dirty and very noticeably taupe. it is terrible paired together. i also didn't like the feel of the terrycloth-like fabric against my skin. even though this is a good quality piece with a lot of interesting detail, i'm absolutely sending it back.",0
"The straight-leg silhouette is ruined for me by the immediate bulge beneath the elastic waistband, mostly caused by the pockets. their openings protrude out right below the waistband. it's not flattering and while the trousers are not too tight for my hips, they give the impression of extra hips. if not for that silhouette issue, i would keep the trousers, as they are comfortable and pretty, and unlike my other trouser options. not see-through, as i feared.",0
"The melon color is soft and flattering. it is a little on the long side in the back, but i paired it with a lightweight, flowy sweater, and received compliments.",1
"This dress is an absolute attention getter. it's incredibly unique, and fits beautifully. i'm very short, and often have problems pulling off this much pattern, but this dress was just right.",1
"I saw this at the store today. very excited about it but i had no idea how to get it on! there is a side zipper so i attempted to step into the jumper through the collar but could never get my arms through! from what i could see on my body, it would have been too short in the crotch. i decided not to fight with it to put on entirely. i gave up. cute shade of green though.",0
"While this top is pretty, it's very unflattering. it just looks so boxy on me that it makes me look heavier. too bad, because i really wanted to like it.",0
"Oh dear. the elastic waistband just ruined this skirt for me--it made it look so cheap. i assumed from the photograph that the skirt was a knit over a structured lining with a real waistband with a zip. instead, it's a sweatshirt knit with no lining and elastic. it looked cheap and hung a bit baggy from the elastic waist, making it a no-go for me.",0
I wanted to love this shirt. the fit was a little off and i wish it had come in a little at the waist to be more figure flattering before it flared out. the fabric is nice but wrinkles easily and in the white is see through.. sadly i will be returning.,0
"They look nice on the page, but they didn't work on my body. made me look big and boxy. maybe if you're super-skinny, they'll be fine.",0
The fit on these is frustrating. with l space you almost have to try everything on first because the sizing is different from one cut to the other. i wear a 25/26 jean and a medium in this bottom still felt and looked too small.,0
"I loved these pants - super soft and cozy and perfect for winter. i've worn them a handful of times and have washed them maybe twice max and they already have 2 holes! they don't say handwash and my washer/dryer is brand new and pretty gentle on my clothes. maybe i just ended up with a bad pair, but i found the quality to be disappointing :(",0
"Saw on my way out of the store and had to try them on. they are very comfortable and surprisingly cute. the jogger style usually doesn't flatter my curvier body but these have a drape to the fabric that made them look so much nicer. i took in two sizes, my usual small and a medium since i just had my second child and still have some post baby weight. i still went with the small after trying on both though. the medium was a bit too big and shapeless. the small was comfortable and looked better. t",1
"These pants are cute. they seem, to me, to have a wider leg than appears on the model. they do run big, so i would recommend sizing down if in doubt. these are cute pants that can be dressed up or down, but unfortunately, look pretty sloppy by the end of the day, as they stretch and wrinkle very quickly. since they already run a bit big, this is a major negative. i wore them to church, and they were quite wrinkled by time i got home. by late afternoon, they looked like a different pair of pants.",1
"This was about to be my first retailer splurge item, but i think i'm not there yet. for the rich price tag, these pants weren't going to be versatile enough for me. they're very light weight and even translucent in sunlight. perfect for a small subset of my days but not going to make the cut for casual friday. that light patch near the r knee is also a pocket- tended to flap open and look about as nonsensical as it is. if you're already on this level good for you! i had to send these back.",0
"Very long, so may need to hem if your inseam is under ~34"". beautiful trousers!",1
"Ordered the biggest size available, the large. the arms are so tight, i couldn't get it on. looked like it may have fit in the body so i don't understand why so constricting in the arms. i don't have big arms, either. fabric is thin but the color is pretty. can't recommend. i'd pass on this one.",0
This jacket is high quality leather and will bring you years of wear! i made sure to add a little room to accommodate thick sweaters!,0
"These pants are very cute for spring/summer, and i enjoy having the option of a looser silhouette with a bit of length (nearly all of my pants are a cropped skinny these days!). i agree with the other reviews that have described the leg as being less straight-legged than they are pictured. on me, they have a subtle flare -- nothing major, but just enough to break perfectly over my shoe. they fit tts on me, but i did need to have the hem taken up. i'm 100 lbs, 5'0 and the 0p fits perfectly. i hav",1

"First, let me say that the photo does not do this exquisite print justice! the fabric is worth framing! on a white ground, the tones of rose, pink, purple and touches of blue make it even more fabulous! the fit is a tad large, as i am 5' 3"" and usually an size 6, but must size up to 8 or m because of my chest. even zipped, it is a tad big, but nothing that i cannot deal with. i don't really see the swing in the dress, as it does not flare out in any way, but is certainly is loose and flowing, bu",1
"Like other reviewers, found leg more flared/straight than pictured. i wore all day at work (desk job) and didn't see any wrinkling.",1
"I bought these pants on a whim while i was at my local retailer. i was so delighted after trying them on because i've never tried on a pair of linen pants that i actually liked. they definitely have more of a flair leg rather than straight leg like the picture suggests. i wore them for several hours at a party and they didn't stretch that much on me. i agree with the other review in that they do get a little wrinkly but not much more than what i would expect from linen fabric. i'm 5'3"" so t",1

they look perfect with my birkenstocks so i'm getting then in all colors.",1
"I immediately picked out this in the taupe color at the store. the black was pretty basic looking, but this color is gorgeous. it's quite flowy on me (i wear an xs/s most places but usually small in tops here) the sleeves stretched out a bit after a day of teaching too. one of my favorite tops at retailer right now!",1
I tossed this in my bag (online) at the last minute thinking i'd give it a shot. so glad i did. this is dress is so simple and so much more flattering then i expected. you can dress it up or down. i wish it was about 1/2 inch longer but still a good length for me (things are always too short for me). the material could be a little thicker but then i suppose it would lose the bounce that is so key to the flow of thing with this dress.,1
"Pretty shirt on the hanger, but there's a goof in the design. when i tried it on my 3d self, there became this weird ruffle right beside/below the bust that you can barely see in the right of the photo, now that i know it's there. the tulip nature of the shirt is pretty in concept, but where the top layer starts makes the fabric stick out right by your bust and it's not flattering, and i'm just a 34 b.",0
"Just got these and love them. the blue color is a great bright shade without being too crazy and they fit well. i'm 5'7"" 138# straight build and ordered 27 (true to size for me.) they have loosened up throughout the day and the waist and hips are a bit baggy now but i like that they're not ultra-tight. nice light fabric for the summer.",1
"This sweater feels good and not itchy at all. i'm long waisted and the small hit right at my hip bone/top of my low-waisted jeans, so it's kinda on the shorter side. i liked it that way, bc it's not baggy at the bottom and is figure flattering. i tied the tie twice and thought it looked better. i have long arms and was excited the sleeves go down to the middle of my hands. it has little hole detailing down the middle, but not so much that you'd have to wear a shirt underneath.",1
I love these socks! they are super thick and comfy. the quality feels great and they were cheap!,1
"If you're like me and wish you could carry on downtown boho dressing when the time to take out your puffer comes to pass, this tunic is essential. though the silky alpaca-wool knit is thicker than gauzy cotton, it drapes just as well and keeps one's self warm and cozy without the bulk of a sweater. i was concerned with the elastic banding at the bottom of the tunic because i'm only 5'4"", but high-waisted, and banded hems tends to always hit me at the wrong spot. luckily, it's not very binding, s",1
"I ordered a small from the online shop knowing it would be drapey, but it's much more than drapey. and the front draping looks like halloween costume material - not chic or sophisticated. sadly, i will be returning this top.",0
Dress is much different in person. thin ribbed cotton.  a little tight for xl.    it looks like a throw back dress from contempos.  returned and would not recommend,0
This jacket is so adorable on! i have no idea why retailer styled it with a chunky cream turtleneck under it considering the jacket is also cream and it's hard to tell what it even looks like?! i've been searching for a coat like this to give my leather jacket a break. in my opinion a lot of the faux coats look like they have cheap itchy material. this definitely does not! it is super soft and the faux fur is of high quality. the inside is also lined and feels like a very thick soft jersey sweater,1
"I tried this shirt on in store, and loved it! it has a flattering fit and is very comfortable. i read some other reviews about the quality not being good, i don't feel that way at all. the knit and the silky/satiny materials both feel like quality to me. the one concern i have is that it may wrinkle easily. i'm 5'4'' and 125lbs and the xs fits well. i plan to pair it with skinny jeans.",1
"This tunic is a perfect length for leggings. the mauve color got rave reviews on my first wearing. and the mixed media and asymmetrical styling gave the garment a unique appeal and made it quite flattering. however, when i wore it a second time, i noticed two micro holes in the sleeve. one near my wrist and the other at the shoulder. since i take extreme care when laundering my clothes, it seems this will have to be a return as the jersey knit is not strong enough to hold up in the delicate cycl",0
"I tried this top on today because i was really hoping i could get the shorts and robe set. the shirt was softer than i was expecting, but when i tried it on it was an uncomfortable fit. there was some tightness in the armpit area, which is not where i would have expected it to be tight. the rest of it was comfortable and reasonable looseness so i don't think a size up would have been a good option for me. i like the design a lot so i was really disappointed it didn't fit. it is between a lightwe",0

"Tried this on in the ""onsie"" area of retailer store. i usually am between a medium and a large. the medium fit fine. the material in this top is substantial - very thick and soft but it is very thick as a warning. more for a pretty cool spring evening vs the heat of the summer in chicago. not sure how much the material would stretch out either. as it seems like it could be the type. also, it is dry clean only, and on such a casual top, that is a real deal killer for me. 

regarding the style of",0
This jacket was too wide and the length in the arms too short. i wear a medium in almost any article of clothing and felt like i was swimming in a short little jacket. the ratio of how wide it is to the length is not for me but might work well with other body types. the arms were definitely too short.,0
"I was so pleasantly surprised when i received this in the mail, because it's much more substantial than i thought it would be. it's perfect for fall and spring and the lining is very soft. i thought it'd be more difficult to wear but it goes well with everything! i ordered my usual size small and am happy with the fit.",1
"I wanted this jacket to fit on me like in the photo, but i guess my frame was still to petite. the fabric was also on the cheap end",0
"I almost bought this skirt yesterday in store, but decided against it because the fabric was subpar. the skirt i tried on was snagged and unraveled. i selected another skirt, which i purchased. as the sales associate was folding the skirt, i noticed that this one was also snagged and unraveling. despite loving the style and fit, i had to be realistic with my lifestyle and decided to return it then and there. if there were two severe snags on two skirts before even leaving the store, how would th",0
"It just didn't work for me. i don't know if it is my fair complexion and untanned legs, but this dress was a strike out. the orange floral design and beading is beautiful and the fitting i would say is pretty tts. for reference, i am 5'7"" and 145lbs with 36"" 30"" 40"" measurements and i purchased a medium. the chest and arms were not too tight like other reviews stated. the length is about the length in the picture and a lot of fabric to make it very flowy. overall, very good quality and beautiful",0
"Was in my local retailer today and just had to try this on! it appeared to be a structured jacket, but it is actually a sweater-jacket! gives a very ""chanel"" vibe and looks so chic. i plan on wearing it with just about everything. i would probably wear it open most times, but i love the closure with the button detail. i am large busted, but petite, 119 lbs., 5'2"", and this was way more flattering on me than most jackets. normally, the sleeves are too long, but these were just right! i am sure i wi",1
"I own the green version of this jacket and ordered the ivory as well because of the sale price and because i loved the green one so much. i highly recommend this jacket to wear over dresses, with jeans or skirts all year round!",1
"I ordered this to go over a dress. i wanted the jacket short, to not cover the waist of the dress. on sale, i think it is a great bargain. the sleeves are long on me, but i rolled them, which i thought was intended since they are lined. the medium fit me. i am usually an 8 in tops. the ivory color is almost a pure white.",1
"I love my new blazer! the material is very soft and comfortable, and very nice quality, but not too ""wooly"" to wear into spring. the cut is very flattering, and the patterns and fringe details are very eye-catching. i am 5'6"" and usually wear a size s in retailer and this small fit perfectly. they grey/cream color combo is gorgeous and looks very versatile, and can be dressed up or down.

the one alteration i suggest is moving the button; at the shoulder it gives a wide boxy shape. my tailor wil",1
"I wear size 8 , ordered a medium, fits great. nice quality, like that you can wear open or buttoned at the shoulder.",1
If you like to wear lampshades this is the shirt for you. beyond unflattering. boxy and seriously looks like lace was stitched to the bottom of a lampshade,0
"I was very excited to receive these pants and wished they had worked out as the fabric is structured and yet comfortable. however, while stretchy they looked very tight on the thigh and yet were too big in the waist. i will acknowledge i'm a runner with somewhat muscular legs, but was hopeful these pants wouldn't cling to them. for reference, i'm 125 lbs and usually wear a size 25-26 in pants.",0
"I absolutely love this pullover and am so glad i purchased it. it is the perfect weight for fall/winter, super soft, true to size. the diamond shape opening in back looks great with my strappy yoga bras, i have received compliments every time i wear it. i am 6', 144lb, slim/athletic build and often have trouble with sleeve length. this however is perfect & i can use the thumb holes as designed without stretching the sleeves in an awkward way. wish it came in more colors!",1
"This is the perfect top. it is adorable, and the fit and cut of it is forgiving.",1
"I so wanted to buy this top - especially during the 30% off tops sale this past weekend - so it would have been just about $100.  but while it was well made, i could see it easily snagging or getting caught on jewelry.    if it was on sale even more, i might have considered it.  it could be extremely versatile, with jeans, black skinny pants or leggings.  really loved it, but couldn't see spending that much money on it.",1
"Perhaps i have gotten too used to flowy shirts, or the cut of this was not right for me, but it felt too fitted around the rear end and the shoulders didn't lay right on me. sizing up would have only made it too big in the shoulders so i returned. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, curvy/muscular frame and ordered a size small.",0
"I ordered this in size xl. the ivory was as pictured. the lace details were well-done. but, the length was much shorter than on the model. i'm 5 ft. 5 1/2 in. for reference. even the sleeves were on the short side, above my wrists. the main problem is how much it shed. just in trying it on, there was fuzz everywhere so i returned it. i love when retailer mixes lace into the knit of sweaters. this one just didn't work out.",0
"I was so excited when i ordered this, i love comfy clothing this looked perfect! when i received it, there was a weird smell with the top. convinced that this could be from storage or something, i washed it. the smell did not go away. i have washed it 3 times now and the smell will not disappear! i have not yet worn but as i have washed it, not able to return it. the top looks and feels great - just the weird smell. now i am 'stuck'!!",0
I purchased this in the red (really more of a brick color) and wore it so much that i went back to get it in black too! i received a ton of compliments when i wore it! the fabric is a nice weight and it hangs beaufully. looks great over skinny jeans or leggings. i plan on wearing it year round!!,1
"It is a beautiful sweater, but it is cropped and boxy.",0
Love this top! red color is a bit orangey for my taste but overall a fabulous piece.,1
This is a nice shirt and very flattering. the ivory is actually more of a tan/brown- i would not call it ivory or off white. the material has a nice texture to it as well. it does run big and long so keep that in mind when purchasing.,1
Loved the look of this sweater online. was disappointed when i took it out of the package i was surprised at how stiff and itchy it was. i ordered my usual medium and though at first they shipped the wrong size it was small all over.  it felt cheep definelty not worth the high price. knew it was definitely going back,0
The top is gorgeous and bohemian like with a loose fit. the top arrived with a small black stain and some of the lace already ripped. it might be too delicate for me to even exchange for another and wear. i am going to have to return it.,0
"For cat lovers in particular, these socks will grab your attention. they are fine quality ankle socks. the kittens are really more moss green than beige.",1
"After seeing the picture online, i was coveting this top for a while and then retailer days happened! i immediately ordered it, but i'm still not sure if i'm going to keep it. i ordered a 2p (0p was sold out) and i was assuming it was going to be a little big, but i like flowy. the sleeves and chest are perfect but the top is cut so generously in the back (and it's a bit longer in the back as well) i feel like it looks like i'm wearing a wedding dress. i love it from the front. i'm going to try to",0
"This top is perfect for wanting that fall/winter look in warmer climates. the slits on the sides allow for a lot of movement and turtleneck is just right. i love wearing it with my paige bell canyon flairs and some clogs! my only thing i wish was that it was cut in so much at the top, as how you can see at the model's armpit, wish that part was a little wider it would be a bit more flattering. otherwise great top, i have it in black and been thinking about getting it in the orange color too!",1
"Thought i'd love this top; i'm a sucker for lace anything from retailer.  but i found the lace, while pretty, to be quite rough, which to me indicates a lower quality. and i guess i should've known that it would be very swingy (photos show that) but it really overwhelmed me.  for reference, 5'5"", 125 lbs, 34d. sad, but this went back.",0
"While i love the design, this sweater even in the small is too over-sized for me and was unflattering. it was returned.",0
Super large and a very weird cut.  the sides were much shorter than the front and back and this just looked awful on me.,0
Finally got cold enough to wear this shirt. i love it...got lots and lots of compliments. great quality,1
3 tags - one quite huge (about 2'' by 3'') - very itchy. so i cut out the tags and they are sewn with some kind of hard poky plasticy thread - now even more itchy! i will have to wear these inside out.,0
"I tried this on in the store and i couldn't keep it on my body for more then 30 seconds. it's extremely itchy, which is a pity, because i do appreciate the design. :(",0
"The stitched v-neck tunic is a very charming piece to your wardrobe. it is soft and feminine, and has added charm with the fringed bottom.
it is a comfortable piece that looks great with leggings or skinny/straight jeans. 
it is a loose fitting design, so it is a bit large. opt for a smaller size if you prefer a closer fit to your curves.",1
"I really loved the pattern on this shirt and the colors were nice too. something a little different than a plain white shirt. however, it was a little boxy on me and the material was kind of stiff (i am realizing that i am a sucker for soft material?). if this goes on sale, i may purchase it again, but i did end up returning the shirt.",0
"I bought the orange color. i had a hard time styling it as it is so long. since it is a turtleneck and short sleeve, you'll need a jacket or sweater on top. nothing looked right. it has a relatively high and tight neck, so sweaters looked weird. short jackets didn't work either. i'm 5'4"" and bought the small. returned it for the charente cowl neck which worked much better",0
"I wanted to like this top, as the fabric was nice and thick, but found that it dipped too low beneath the armpits, which would be ok if your lats are in perfect shape, but i've always found that cut made mine look a bit saggy (and i'm not heavy). not great enough to keep in my opinion.",0
"Missed these last year in black, so snatched them up when i saw them this season! great,versatile wardrobe piece - dress them up or down with knee-hi boots, booties, or great heeled pump with silk blouse or sweater. love something that i can wear so many ways, and look and feel polished and put together.",1
"I bought the white in a m, one size down from my normal. i could have gone with a s, given the swingy shape and forgiving nature of the linen. it is very light and comfortable. the length is a tunic on me, at 5'6"", so keep that in mind. if you dry it in the dryer it will shrink for sure. i never recommend drying linen knits in the dryer because they will likely develop holes. i love this tank and will probably buy another color or two. if they get black or grey i will def. buy another one.",1
"I'm so excited that retailer is bringing back some of the gorgeous fabrics and details they used to have. the all over embroidary is beautiful, the cotton/silk blend is delicious, and there's enough shaping that the top doesn't look too boxy. i did end up sizing down for a slightly more fitted loo and for a smaller armhole. i also picked through a couple of tops to find the one i wanted, since the embroidery pattern wasn't centered on some of them.",1
"I got this shirt in stores because it went on sale! i was excited to wear it, but it felt a little long on me. i decided that after a regular wash, it would help it. after washing, it shrunk way more than my other retailer clothes! now the arm straps feel really tight and the fabric lost its flowy-ness. it's a classic shirt, but it may not be worth the price for the quality of the fabric. be careful when washing.",0
"This is one of my favorite tanks i have ever worn. the swing style means you can wear it with any pants, and the straps are wide enough to accommodate a serious bra. i usually wear an l/xl but am wearing a m in these, so definitely size down at least once. you will love this!",1
"Simple style with a great fit. love the pink, mustard, and cream colors together. fits true to size.",1
I'm fairly petite and was not expecting this to be as long as it was on me- it's actually great for leggings or skinny jeans though- good quality material too!,1
"This dress is so much more stunning in person than in the photos. it's incredibly flattering, and i like how it pans out at the bottom. it also has pockets! although it has a built-in slip, it is a little see-through, so keep that in mind, otherwise, i can't wear it enough.",1
"This skirt is classic, very high quality and even better in person. it runs true to size. the material is slightly thick and will be great for fall, winter and early spring. my only complaint is, i wish it had pockets. i love tracy reese designs. i can't wait to wear this for thanksgiving.",1
"I bought the red and white. both tank tops were a nice, thick material- definitely high quality. i was hoping there would just be a little bit of swing at the bottom, just enough to be loose and flattering. but there is a ton of extra fabric at the end, which with a larger bust wound up edging into looking a little maternity. but i think it'd be great on you if you tend to do well with very drapey or swingy tops. it runs a touch big- im normally between a small and an xs, and the xs was not even",0
"This is a beautiful long midi blazer that happens to feel like a sweatshirt. buy it! you'll look super classy and put together. i wear to work and going out. i've been noted to also curl up in bed wearing this because it's so comfortable and i forgot to switch into a sweatshirt. 

note i'm on the short side so the ""blazer"" ends up being a little longer for me. i happen to like it because it gives it a little more formalness of a longer coat while still being spring weight (jersey/terry on the",1
"So disappointed in the abundance of polyester fabrics that retailer carries these days. especially at this price point. the pattern and style of this dress is beautiful, but i will never spend two hundred dollars (or even half that) on a poly dress. please add more linen, cotton, and silk!",0

"I was at my local retailer this weekend, needing a bathing suit for an upcoming trip and this set was sitting in the ""get it while it lasts"" section, in my size. i tried it on (top in two different sizes 32c and 34b and a bottom), and it was literally the only time in my life i've ever tried on a bathing suit and been happy with the results! great material, the design is retro but with a modern twist with the fabric, supportive top without squishing (went with the 32c...same as my regular bras), t",1
"I was hesitant to buy these jeans online because citizens are generally not very forgiving, being that they don't have much stretch.  they are always in the stack that i try on but haven't bought a pair of citizens in several years. these are totally different!  the have enough stretch to be sculpting without being uncomfortable while keeping the substantial feeling that comes with denim versus leggings.  i looooooove these jeans!!!",1
It feels soft and like a good quality. however it really does run large and long. i was looking for a loose tank but this one was almost a tunic on my short height and even with a cardigan to give it a shape didn't work out. i also thought it would shrink in the dryer but it didn't. also wrinkles easily.,0

"Comfort is very important to me. as someone who is not a skinny girl, slimming clothing is important to me. this top is very pretty, comfortable, and can be dressed up or down. it does require dry cleaning, which might be a con for some people.",1
"After reading the glowing reviews i was excited to buy this on sale. i'm tall and lean, but found the dress looked slightly awkward and off on me compared to the model pictures. firstly, the top has a strange transition to the skirt, with extra fabric you have to either blouse over the skirt or bunch together. if you blouse it and lay flat, it invariably gets bunched as you wear it. this bunching changes the aesthetics of the color blocks, creating less clean lines. i also found the blue, black",0
"So versatile and comfortable. i plan adding this into my rotation year round under a jacket or cardigan during the colder months. if you prefer baggier fit, i would suggest going up a size.",1
"I got the moss and love the color. the style and size in 31p is perfect for my short self. very comfy for work. now, i need more colors...",1
This dress is really attractive in terms of the pattern and the neckline. but the dealbreaker for me was the lack of darts in the back hip area--so that the stretch fabric really hugs the full curve of your booty. a size larger gave me bagginess in the top and a still snug fit in back that i just didn't feel comfortable about. some darts could have made a nicer fit here. but this is a a great dress if you don't mind a super body con fit.,0
"I love the colors of the teal dress, but i wish that the top only had one color. the design is cute but the construction is a little off. the transition from the top to the skirt seems to lay wrong or have a bit of extra fabric. sizing up or down didn't help. the top is lined but the bottom is very thin. the bottom should be lined too. not the best.",0

I bought the black version of this dress. looks exactly like the picture and is true to size.,1

Usually wear stevie jeans from ag but wanted to try something different. now i love farrah!,1
"I so wanted to love this dress, despite the reviews. when i opened the package i fell in love with the fabric. the print is absolutely beautiful and the fabric feels luxurious. the dress fit perfectly but there was just too much fabric (even though i absolutely loved the fabric). the flowing overlay was just too much. i am returning it.",0
Nice cut but 6 inches too long and no petite sizes available.,0
The pictures don't do this dress justice. it is fantastic! the fit is perfect and it is super comfortable while still looking polished. a must have dress!,1
"I love this maxi dress. it is fitted up top and very maxi like on the bottom. it was to much fabric for me, the dress made me look heavier than i am. i am 5'9' and 160. i fit in the medium. the dress just didn't do anything for my body type - curvy. i think you need to be fairly lean to look nice in this dress. sadly, i had to return. maeve makes great maxi's, unfortunately they don't fit me correctly.",0
"This dress is simply gorgeous. the slit is just right, the colors are great, and most of all the fabric is very comfy! i highly recommend!",1
I love all the pilcro chinos. they fit great and the material is so soft. they also wash very well.,1
I love white for summer and by august i am tired of wearing sleeveless...so this caught my eye. it is very easy to wear and pretty on. i wore it with black tie up shoes and accessories. super comfy & stylish.,1
"Love this top so much that i bought it in both colors. the fabric is wonderful and the pleated front is a nice feature. i also like the fabric covered buttons. you can button this top all the way or leave the top few buttons undone. either way, it looks cute. i especially like that it looks great under a blazer or cardigan and will look good uncovered when the weather heats up. great quality and features for the price.",1
"I was nervous about this dress, as when i ordered it there were no reviews yet...and shortly after they, they started coming in and were only negative. yes it runs pretty big (i'm usually a large/12 but could tell from the model it would run big) but it's supposed to be loose. i wouldn't say it's the most flattering - but you can tell it's shapeless from the picture! it's a great casual dress, perfect for hot days when i don't want my clothing touching my skin.",1
"This dress is stretchy and soft, a great length, and an out of this world pattern. it will probably be flattering on every body, but it certain flattered mine.",1
"I really loved the uniqueness of this dress, and i was hoping to be able to wear it to work, but it was just a little too fitted for the office!",1
"After reading the reviews, i had high hopes for this dress but was disappointed that it wasn't flattering on me. 
i'm 5'4"", 126 pounds and generally wear a size small, but the small of this dress looked more like a maternity outfit on me. it squeezed the bust a bit too much, and left open some of the areas just under the arms that could probably have used a teensy bit more coverage to be truly flattering.",0
I was disappointed with the style and quality of this dress. it poofs out funny in the waste and it just looks very unflattering. i'm sending it back.,0
"This dress pattern and material are great - it's just way too big. i even tried an xs and it looked like a huge sack on me. too bad, it had some real potential.",0
This dress is gorgeous! i bought the patterned dress and it has the perfect colors for the season. the pictures just do not do it justice. plus it is incredibly comfortable. this dress could easily be dressed it up or down and is perfect for someone who is curvy on top. i can't wait to wear this on a date!,1

"I had high hopes for this tunic for an upcoming ny trip - to look stylish and beat the heat. it is huge. the tunic swallowed my whole. it came down nearly to my knees (i'm 5' 6) and it was gigantic - shapeless and did not look stylish at all. on the model it looks like it hits mid-thigh. i am a size 10 - and the l was like a giant trash bag on me. if i had time, i would try the medium,...",0
"This was a nice dress, but it wasn't quite was i was looking for. the cut made me look too ""hippy"". maybe for someone that has no hips at all?",0
"The colors are beautiful and the fabric is very soft and comfortable. i will be returning because of issues with length and being low cut.

for reference i am 5'5 145lbs, 38-30-40, 34ddd. the dress was low cut and showed too much cleavage for my comfort, but this may not be an issue for women with smaller breasts (or if you don't mind some cleavage showing). this length was also a bit too long, so if you are 5'5 or shorter you may want to order the petite size.",1
"Frumpy is the word i would use to describe this top. i look good in empire waist shirts and seek them out. but this one made me look pregnant and frumpy. and it has an attached camisole, but the sheerness of the top still showed my nude-colored bra strap. so i don't even know what to wear under it. it's going back, even with the sale price.",0
"You can't exactly tell from the picture, but this dress has a skirt that bubbles a little at the bottom, and it really adds interest to the whole piece. i think my favorite part about this dress, though, is the weightiness of the skirt--it's not so heavy that it's hot or uncomfortable, but enough that it feels more quality, more special.",1
This dress fits true to size and is great to wear around on a warm day. you can dress it up or down so there are many uses for it. this brand has always provided great quality too. i'm excited for warmer weather!,1
"This dress is the perfect combo of flattering, comfort, and quality. i purchased the turquoise color, which is vibrant! this will be my go to dress for spring. the material is super soft, flowy and medium weight. i ordered petite s, probably could have got xs. i love, love, love this dress!",1
I love the design and aesthetic of this dress but when i tried it on it was less than flattering on me and looked almost night gown ish:(  really sad because the material is gorgeous! i bought it for my sister instead because i know it will flatter her body type more than mine.  i'm rather full on bottom and top and it seems to look better on slender women.  the only complaint  is have is that the straps seem delicate. the actual material and fabric is crazy beautiful though!,0
"I ordered this dress in a petite but it arrived in a regular, the rest fit and in the meantime the petites ran out in my size.  the dress is too long but it is so beautiful i will get it shortened.  the fabric is lovely.  i am blonde and the green is so nice with my hair... which is a good thing since the other colour was totally sold out.  try not to miss out on this lovely purchase.....",1
Loved the shorts version of these so ordered the pants but not quite the right fit for my legs. no fault of the pants just too skinny in the legs.,1
"Beautiful dress, but has an unflattering fit. i purchased an xs and it's past my knees and the bottom of the dress is so heavy! would be a perfect maternity dress though!",0
"Love it ! ...although i had to purchase it in 3 sizes before finding the right one. it does run large. i normally take a l or el ... but a medium in this had the perfect drape ! i am 5'11"" and 185 lbs and it is very flattering ! a perfect piece to be worn as a dress or as a tunic over skinny pants ... can be as sophisticated or casual as you choose to make it with accessories !",1
"This sweater is really lovely. it doesn't look like it does in the picture. i got the xsmall as i was worried it would run big. it's much shorter than i though, fits more like a petite size. the sleeves are 3/4 length, which i wasn't thrill with but accepted. the color combo is really lovely! it's very comfortable and well made and it was perfect for work but lovely with a pair of jeans too!",1
"The cut is lovely and the fabric is wonderful-it's a little thicker than you might think so it felt a little warm.
i am sending back as i have a little belly and it doesn't hide much-but it did make my boobs look awesome:)",1
"Beautiful shape and colors but the fabric felt heavier than i imagined. sort of like heavy drapes. also, the length (as others mentioned) was too long. i am not normally a petite but the regular was too long. unfortunately, it has to go back.",0
"I loved this when i got it. it has such a flattering fit! slightly loose in the body, but not flowy. nice weight of fabric. comfortable fabric. perfect scoop neck that doesn't show too much cleavage. but i washed it once on delicate and line dried (which i do with most of my shirts) and it came out riddled in holes.",0
"This just arrived today. the material is very soft and i love the olive color. it has a zipper in the back but i was able to easily slip this over my head, making me think it runs a bit large. because it is loose the fact that the drop waist hits right at the hip doesn't bother me, though i thought it would fall a little lower. i am only 5'2"" and i consider this to be a short dress. with thick leggings i think it will be great winter dress. the bodice is fully lined (the skirt is not) and the ne",1
"This dress is versatile and cute! i purchased the xxs at 5'4"" 115lbs and it fit perfect. a steal at the sale price!",1
"My favorite pants, casual and a bit dressier by changing my top. comfortable, classic, well made",1
"I love this dress! i purchased the neutral motif in a large and it fits wonderfully. i have a double d chest and the top of this fits almost perfectly. it's just a bit snug on top but still comfortable because of the fabric. i'm 5""3 and the dress isn't too long like most maxi's are on me. i always have great luck with maeve and plan on purchasing another right now!",1
"This dress is so pretty and i instantly fell in love with it when i tried it on. i generally wear size 0 or 2 and opted for the 2 for more room. i know some reviewers felt that the dress ran too long at the bottom, but for me, i was sold on it because this dress is form fitting, i like a more conservative look for work. wouldn't want form-fitting and short dress. my favorite kind of dress is form-fitting and falls at or below my knees a little.",1
"Alas, i so wanted to love this. the photos of the models wearing it look gorgeous -- flowy, drapey, ultimate grecian goddess. but it just doesn't work unless you're super-skinny. too much material. almost bulky; strange looking. the print is so beautiful -- i love the pink floral, and i love the whole idea of the dress. but it just doesn't work. have to send it back. 

(i'm 5'6"", 135 pounds, 38-30-38, and i ordered a 10.)",0
"Perfect fit. this dress is super flattering, the criss-crossing fabric at the bust looks awesome on. the fabric is a little bit thicker through there which is nice for coverage. the skirt is light and airy and the pattern is so pretty! the perfect spring to summer dress!",1
"Bought this on a whim. i had been wanting a new maxi dress and the bodice looked really cool online. ordered it in black. it fits true to size however the material is a bit on the thin side and where the fabric crosses over on the lower waist line...it leaves a love handle lump. without the bulk it would be great as overall look is kind of cool. however, i am on the fence on this one. for the money there are better maxis out there.",0
I purchased this in the black in an xl. i am typically a 14-16 dress size and i would say this runs tts with a flowing fit on the bottom. the top is fitted but has some stretch to it. absolutely gorgeous fit and quality. i love this so much i want to purchase the teal color. a spring must have!!!,1
"On me this was not good at all. couldn't get it off fast enough. the thick, stretchy fabric instantly added bulk to my frame and the leaf pattern over my mid section emphasized my belly (and i'm a size 2). also, the color is a dark, brick red and i think if it had been a true red it would have been much more attractive.",0
"This dress is very cute and super comfortable. as soon as i walked into work, i received a compliment. the fabric is not heavy, but actually on the thin side. if i knew this dress was maeve, i would have sized down. i'm always a large at retailer, but with some maeve items i need a medium. for reference, i'm 5'9"", 175, l/12. i love the look of a drop-waist, but because of my big bust i usually look silly, but this works.",1
There's just the right amount of billowy grace in this dress. the fit is perfect and the material moves and breathes with you. cute with a jean jacket on chillier days too.,1
"I bought this unique beauty in a size 0. the fit was superb and without compromise. the ascetics are incomparable, as well as the quality. the most stunning dress i have purchased from retailer in quite a while!",1
"This ran a bit small; i'm normally a 2, this was a 4 and 'just' fit. the pattern was very 'digi,' the length was shorter than i hoped (i'm 5'1""), and the fabric, while structured, was just cheap and acrylic-feeling. pass.",0
"I love love this top, it look so much better than expected. i bought black because red wasn't available in my size. the style, print, and fit are perfect. the shirt-style hides flaws, and the top looks very good and stylish. it can be worn for formal or casual occasions. i keep looking to see if the red one is available in my size, i would buy it in every color. perfect!!",1
"This could seriously fit a large and it's an xs. so frustrating!! this is the fourth retailer dress that is ordered that is just enormous. i get the whole ""loose fit"" style, but seriously??? you've taken it to a whole new level, retailer!!! another trip to the store to return another item. a complete waste of my time. ugh.",0
"This didn't work for me.  the piece looked cheap, rode very high...needed to be longer.  the piece looks incomplete for some reason to my eyes.  it also does not seem quality for an retailer piece.  this went back.",0
These pants are the perfect weight and comfort. they are cozy enough to wear around the house and sleep in as well. i highly recommend these dreamy pants.,1
The picture is not a good depiction of what the skirt actually looks like. the colors are more varied and green is the dominant color. it looks great on and the colors compliment each other. i would definitely recommend it as a daily go to item for your wardrobe.,1
"I really loved the way this shirt looked on me. it's forgiving and flattering, and really lightweight. the fabric, however, couldn't even withstand half a day's wear without snagging 3 times and developing a hole right in the center. i have no idea how this happened, as i wasn't wearing or near anything that could have pulled at it. 

such a shame. this could have been a staple wardrobe piece for me.",0
"Beautiful blouse in theory, however, on my 5'9"" frame it came off like a costume. i truly had a nice chuckle as i looked at myself in the mirror. had to sadly return it",0
"I have these pants in the brown & red colors, and i love them both equally! they are stretchy, and stretch out a very little bit as you wear them, but retain their shape & neatness.",1
"I got this shirt and loved it so much the first time i wore it. it swings well and is an easy basic that looks great. however, after i washed it the first time, it became clingy and stuck to me and doesn't lie right. it's such a shame because i was thrilled with this as an addition to my wardrobe!",0
This dress is great for hiding any insecurities. it's also very comfy.,1
I have several tiny tunics in m. i received this one today and it is very cute but too tight in the chest. i'm returning it for a large.,1
"I loved the material's texture and drape, but it was too sheer for me. i am 100% against having to wear a tank under white tees. (which means i have a lot of trouble finding any white tees, but...) 

other than the see-through nature, i loved this shirt!",1
"Definitely agree with the other reviewers. this top looks great on the model, but pretty bad in real life. super boxy and has no give so everything just hangs. if you plan on ordering, i'd recommend sizing down.",0
I received this top in the mail today not what i expected at all! it is a great fabric just way too much of it. it is proportionally incorrect width wise. unfortunately this one will be going back.,0
I love tiny button down tops. this one didn't work at all for me. i was excited about the mix prints but on it looked like i was wearing a vest over a striped shirt. also the arm was frayed on the shirt i tried on.,0
"It's difficult to tell, but the skirt is 3 colors. the pockets are dark brown and the hem or bottom part is army green. skirt fits pretty well but not great. , i'm almost 5 ft 6 in and it hits close to where it hits on model. i would have liked it better slightly longer. i'm 135 lbs and size 6 fits but is slightly on tight side.
material is high quality and thick cotton.",1
This is my new favorite dress!,1
I agree with the previous review that this skirt definitely runs small. i am normally a size 4 with rooms but this size 4 was very tight. i decided not to go through the trouble of exchanging and to keep it. my boyfriend seems to like the style more than i do so that's a good thing :),0
"Color was a perfect match for the linen slacks i wanted to pair it with, however the top was way, say too big so i'll be sending it back.",1
"The fit of this top is nothing like in the photo. the blouse on the model must be pinned back to achieve that fitted silhouette. in reality this top is baggy and boxy and runs at least one size large. the embroidery, details, and soft material are great, but the fit is off entirely. this item is going back.",0
"I love the style, easy to wear to work or out for an evening. great quality.",1
The color is completely off! i loved the way this vest looks in the picture! i was excited to have that vest but unfortunately what i received in the mail was a huge disappointment. it came wrinkled and the brown is not as rich as it is in the picture. very pale. horrible.,0
"Tried this on and loved it except for one thing -- the sleeves are split, so any movement reveals most of your arm, shoulders. which also makes it fairly impractical for winter/the office (yes, i could wear a sweater or blazer with it, but that defeats the purpose of having an all-purpose cute top.) why, retailer? this is a perfectly cute top and looks great with jeans etc., but the split sleeves make it a no-go.",0
"This blouse is just so beautiful! but i do love white blouses, so that may influence my enthusiasm. however, once i buttoned it up, it was just dreamy. i have a long torso and am tall for a typical xs, so it's often hard to find something that's the right length. this is perfect! it may overwhelm some ladies who are on the petite side of height, but it's a rare find for me. paired with a pair of cropped pants because i'd come in a dress, it looks delightfully vintage in the best of ways. i'm sti",1
"I read the online reviews and thought this dress would be a winner. it is tight in the chest (i am not busty) and i would have exchanged it for a larger size but i just didn't like the style. the material is beautiful but between the neutral colors and the style, i felt it was too ""little house on the prairie"". pretty but not the look i was going for.",0
This is a perfect outer layer for chilly mornings or nights. the detail on the back and sleeves is definitely retailer quality. the sleeves do run a little long though.,1
"I adore this dress! as a mom of two under 2, i need things that are cute, but no-fuss. this is exactly that piece! beautifully lined, breezy linen fabric, machine-washable, and flattering. the catch is finding the right size to flatter. i'm 5'7 and 128...found my normal size small to be really big everywhere. i went with the xs to avoid issues in the shoulders, but i maybe could have gone even smaller. fabric doesn't have a lot of give, so if you are large in the chest, my guess would be a possi",1
"I normally wear a medium in retailer dresses, but ordered a small due to the reviews that stated how large this dress is. they weren't exaggerating!!!! the small was way too big for me, and the xxs and xs are already sold out. beware that you will have to size down at least 2 sizes to make the dress fit similar to the model pictured. it is going back for me!",0
"This cardigan is so much more beautiful in person. i thought it would be very lightweight, but it has a nice weight to it. this will go with absolutely everything and looks lovely on!",1
"Such a cute dress but it runs large. i'm 5'4"" 130 lbs and am typically a size 4 can wear a size 2 in certain clothes. i tried on the xs and it was still too big. i would of bought it in an xxs but they are sold out. really a comfy laid back dress that would be comfortable in summer. if they get more xxs i'll buy it.",1
I got the brown one and i'm very please with the softness of the thread and the light weight feel of the fabric.,1
"This is the perfect day dress--loose fit, comfortable fabric. i usually wear a m or l in most dresses of this type, but the s actually was the best fit. i have worn it all summer and it's perfect for hot weather. just order smaller.",1
Really great pair of pants/leggings. considering a second pair. great flattering fit. i ordered the petite as well because i was concerned about the length but the stride on the petite a was to short and the regular was not too long after all.,1
"I bought this in the blue and you should definitely size down. it runs very large. it's amazingly comfortable and high quality. great length as well (not too short and not too long). it has a partial lining so it's not necessary to wear a slip which i love. i get compliments every time i wear it, even one of the saleswomen in retailer asked me where i got the dress. she was surprised when i told her it was from retailer from online. i liked it so much i just ordered the red plaid.",1
"I'm a 36ddd and although that's pretty large, i don't generally have trouble fitting into most retailer clothing. (the tracy reese amoret dress, for example, fits just fine in my regular size.) so, i ordered this dress in my regular size. well, i tried it on, and the right and left sides of the front closure on top were literally about 10 inches apart. there was *no way* this would fit, even if i went up 3 sizes. it's crazy!
this is a terrible shame because it's really a lovely dress and it fits j",1
"This dress really was huge, and not at all flattering. i don't know how they got it to look good on the model in the picture. material was nice and soft, but i really don't see how anyone could look good in this, no matter what your body shape is.",0
"Even on my 5'1"", short-waisted, 100 lb body, this was super short. it was also super boxy. not flattering at all. the blue was a good color but this is going back.",0
"I am ever in search of a light, white, summer top. this is not quite it. there are two distinct layers, and each of them is the scratchy, starchy type of gauze. it would just roast me in the summer sun--but i run fairly hot in general.",0
"I really wanted to love this sweater however it fell much shorter on my 5'10"" frame than it falls on the model, between my belly button and hip, and the sleeves ended just below my elbow and were much more voluminous than they appear in the product shot. i do have long monkey arms though, so on someone more petite it would probably fit more like the model shot.
the quality of the knit seems nice, however the zipper used is very slim and light weight and got stuck twice just while i was trying i",0
"I usually wear a 6 for skirts and dresses, but when i got this in the mail, it ended up fitting a bit snug on my hips. other than that its super cute and has a great liner underneath!",1
I wanted to love this dress but it was too large... and once i washed it (which is recommended) it shrank so i had to return it.,0
"I love these leggings! the material is a bit thicker than your typical leggings material so it hugs without being too clingy like spandex. the fit i's somewhere between leggings and skinny pants. the suede fabric feels soft and looks to be of good quality. the petite fit works perfectly for me as well, no bunching at the ankles. i can see these being a staple in the upcoming months.",0
"This sweater runs large and long in the arms. i am 5'5"" and often wear petite in pants but not tops. the medium petite is perfect, the sweater is a beautiful open gauge knit and will be great this fall/winter for work over a tank and nice pants. the blue color is more of a mint green/blue, very pretty and different than anything i have in my closet. great addition.",1
"Purchased this in the blue color in the store today. honestly, if i had just seen it online i would not have given it a second look. it really is beautiful in person. the bell sleeves are delicate as well as the pattern throughout the sweater. it fits true to size. i would wear it open with a colorful tank underneath. perhaps if you are very tall and very thin you may opt to hook it closed. the sizing is perfect, it flows and i really have to say you must see this in person to really appreciate",1
This is one of those dresses that looks so cute on the model but doesn't look anything like that in reality. it has no shape and it fits weirdly all over. i am normally a m and i ordered the s and it is massive.,0
"I ordered this for my mom in color ""blue motif"". i could not see a difference online between the colors ""brown motif"" and ""blue motif"" - both looked grey to me. in real life blue motif looks grey with a very light bluish tinge to it. it looks like grey wool and light grey-bluish fiber was interwoven, but you have to look very closely to see that. i guess i would have prefered a pure white or cream color but that is a matter ot your pesonal taste i guess. the cardigan style is an oversized one. t",1
I love the color of this cardigan and the cashmere is very soft. i love the detail in the stitching and how the zipper is covered. i do wish it were a bit longer but it's definitely a keeper.,1
"This dress was love at first sight.  i did have to size down from my normal size but the dress is so comfortable and cool.  as another reviewer said, it does shrink after first wash but perfect now since i am 5'2"".  it shrank about one inch in length only.  i got many compliments and my husband said it was beautiful- that's a plus! i was comfortable and cool all day.  get it before it is out of stock.  this dress will not make it to sale.",1
"This is the most beautiful dress! so many beautiful patterns, the zipper across the front and belt across the front is so flattering and sexy. beautiful flower applique on the hips. everything about this dress is magnificent!",1
It's not as form fitting & hour-glass shaped in real life as on the model. i think they must have clipped it in the small of her back so it does not look so boxy. otherwise it's nice.,0
"When i wore this the two times i did, i got a ton of compliments. it runs small, and is a bit tight when sized correctly but its really stunning. after the second wear, the fabric under the arms frayed and its now unwearable. i have to return it and am so disappointed. sadly, i would not recommend buying it for that reason.",0
I ordered 2 dressed in 2 different sizes. neither fit... both were very tight... runs very small.,0
"Beautiful dress but the fit was off for me. overall this is good quality with beautiful lace detail. as the other reviewer mentioned the cutout in the back is very cute. i wanted to love this dress but i found it to run large in the top. i'm 5'6 130lb with 34c and i ordered the small, the top just hung off of me. perhaps it would have been better with an xs.",1
"I can't say enough good things about this piece. high quality in structure and design. when i initially put it on i worried that i might have ordered a size too small. so i was pleasantly surprised to realize this dress fits like a glove but has enough give in all of the right places to let you eat, dance, breath, etc. i received tons of compliments.
of note, i am 128 lbs and 5/5 - i wore a size 4.
wanting another event that i can wear this to as i wore it to a work xmas party.",1
"I love this shirt and although it is see through a tank works great under it to wear to work. the buttons on the back are sewn on really well and it comes down far enough/ is not too short. i am about 5'4"" and 100 pounds. the 00 was tight on my neck so i kept a 0. otherwise the 00 would have fit fine since its a blousy shirt and would not have been too tight in the shoulders or armpits.",1
"This is beautiful and the leather metallic circles are sewn on really well, i checked a bunch of them because initially that was my concern that one would get caught on someone's clothes. the 6 fits perfect (5'9 and 140 lbs). goes really well with the dark denim shirt that they displayed in store. definitely a fun piece for the holiday season.",1
"Pretty fabric, nice style, took it back.",0
"Dress looks beautiful, but the fitting is very off. i ordered a size 2 which is the dress size i usually wear ( i'm 5;4 and 115lbs). the chest area fits perfectly, but the hip area is extremely tight and the lower back area was lose. i exchanged it for a 4, the hip area was a bit tight and the shoulders were too lose. if i ordered the 4p, i have a feeling it would be too tight. it feels like, it's meant for someone with very small hips and a large abdomen. also, this dress is very stiff, can't d",0
Overall construction/craftmanship of skirt is poor- the dots were sewn in on the seam- some dots didn't lay flat on side by seam- looked like some dots were missing around the top part of skirt in back- ( very disappointed in the quality from retailer- my last 3 or so orders have been similar complaints with their items- sad!!!),0
"I bought this for a wedding i will attend 10 months from now. when i saw this dress on sale, i just need to get it! it was simply gorgeous!!! it fitted so well. it makes one feel so special. i like the addition of the belt.",1
"This skirt manages to be both sophisticated and whimsical. it's well-made, classy, feminine, and timeless. love it!",1
"I love this skirt. unfortunately, no petite sizing was available when it was affordable (on sale). i purchased the 6 regular (based on ""small waist"" reviews) thinking i'll just have it shortened. did not realize there are 4 layers and tailoring would have cost $60+. was considering anyway, but when pinned up, the skirt lost its fullness and i didn't care for that look. if anyone has a 6 petite they want to off-load or exchange with me for a 6 regular, am very happy to do so. this is one skirt i",1
"These coveralls are not cut long enough, i am long in the body and it is very hard for me to find coveralls overalls that are long enough and these unfortunately are the same. i have large breast so that adds to the problem so when i stand sideways and look at the waistband the front you can see is pulled up where the back is hanging lower. they really are nice, my first thought when i put them kn was wow i look a tad like michael myers in them but they're really very cool.....wish i could keep",1
"What a huge dissippointment when this arrived home.....

the sleeves are very long and very boxy...
i have no idea the condition of this on store, but came with damages on sleeves also, we can tell that was something wrong and i was surprise that retailer sent me something like that, i'm a customer here for a very long time!!!!

dissipointed!!!! ;(",0
"Saw this skirt in the store, but the size was wrong. i am normally a 0 or 2 at retailer, but i was afraid that the 2 would be just too much material, so i ordered the 0, and boy, am i glad.
elegant, can go from day to night with the right shoes and accessories.
anticipating many compliments.",1
"The most important thing to note about this skirt is that it is a true blue color- not black! it's also perfect for spring , summer and early fall. super comfy, casual yet elegant. size runs a tiny bit small as the waist is not elasticized. a staple of a cozy chic wardrobe.",1
I'm always on the search for a comfortable shirt with style. this does not disappoint. super comfy and flattering. love.,1
The purple/cobalt is a beautiful color. i feel the t shirt material is entirely too thin for the price.,0
Like most retailer clothes this runs large. nice design & comfort.,1
Kinda a boxy looking sweater. it definitely made me look really large and just couldn't see myself wearing it very often. ended up returning it.,0
Great tee! flows well and very soft. true to size!,1
"Ordered this in xl- i usually am between l and xl. i'm 5'9"" and thought it was cropped, boxy, and billowy around the midsection that was not flattering. the fabric is light and is less like a blazer, more like a cardigan.",0
"I just adore these shorts from art dept. they are casual, yet slightly structured. the length is just perfect (for me), no ride up, no wrinkles (i can't stand wrinkled shorts), and the fringe gives these shorts a fun and playful look just perfect for a stroll on the beach or shopping with your girlfriends. i know these shorts are going to be a staple in my summer wardrobe for years. can i have these in more colors and patterns too????",1
"I saw this in the store and fell in love with it! i normally wear between a 29 and 30 in pants and the medium fit great. it is a very generous cut in the leg and the waist has an elastic band in the back. i'm 5'5"" and the pants almost graze the top of my foot, perfect for sandals. if i had seen this stock photo first i would have been totally off-put by the culotte length, but i guess that's what it looks like on a model! there are cute buttons that run down the outside length of the pants and t",1
"I was expecting a tunic with a bit of structure and weight to layer over leggings, with boots, etc.

this is just an oversized turtleneck - there's nothing special about it. it's thin material. nothing to justify the price.

the sizing seems odd. i'm normally a 2 on the top and 4 on the bottom. the xs was huge up top (i was swimming in it - much larger than it appears in pictures on the model) and spanned across my hips (more than the model).

even if i could find a size that worked, there was n",0

"I ordered this dress to wear to a mid summer evening wedding. i love it. i think it will be fun, and it is unexpected for me. i will need to order a smaller size.i am 5'-5"" and almost always wear a 4 in retailer wear. this ran a little big on the top, i will be ordering a 2 and sending one back",1
"I think the fabric is very nice and soft. i find this top runs very large. i am 5'2"" 130l. normally wear a small in a shirt. i should have ordered xs it is very large. i actually looked to see if they sent me the wrong size. the shoulder area fits fine. i may try tucking it in. other than size a nice top.",1
"Best jumpsuit ever! so soft and always gets compliments! get one now before they're gone. also it is supposed to be tied in front! i'm 5'3"" and the small petite is just perfect!",1
"This shirt looked so perfect on the model, and i was so excited to get it! when i received it, it was so soft and the color was so vibrant. the only thing is, it's too big. it kind of looks like a maternity shirt. it will definitely have to be taken in on the sides for me, but i'm happy with it other than that. i'm normally a l/xl but m would have been perfect this time.",1
"So this is a great tee, problem is the white you can see through. i an not looking for a layering tee so not what i was looking for.",0
"I loved the way this shirt looked when i tried it on in the store buto when i got home i realized it's extremely sheer. you can't wear a white bra with it, for example because it will show through. taking it back.",0
"These pants are extremely comfortable and flattering. i bought them in coral, and wore with a black peasant top, sandals and a long necklace. they do stretch out a lot though, so i would recommend sizing down. i bought mine to look like they fit on the model, and after a few hours they were hanging off of me, so buy them a little bit tighter than you like. the drawstring is purely decorative and does not tighten the waist.",1
"Got this in the moss color. i throw on a hoodie almost every day to walk my dog so i justified the high price. returned it because it was not cute on. the waffle fabric didn't stand out, and the bottom just hung straight. i thought it would be more ruffle-like. even on sale i won't buy it ~ it's just that blah",0
"Love this sweater.. fits perfect, flattering and soft. i got it in both colors. it is a true staple!",1
"This jumpsuit is very comfortable. the material is soft the waist is elasticised, it is not drawstring as it seems in the photos.",1
"I see all the amazing reviews and on one hand, i agree with them. but these pants do run huge and they don't fit tailored like on the model. on me, they fit loose around the legs and thighs and they're super wrinkly. you'll have to iron these after every wear and every wash. i'm surprised to see the comment saying they're wrinkle resistant. they aren't. also, the kahki is more grey which i don't love. i got these on sale, but even at $50 i just can't justify keeping them. they're super comfy but",0
"This is adorable! i got it to wear on the plane for an upcoming vacation. this is definitely tts. i am normally a medium and got the medium. i am long wasted and this fit just fine. looks like it does on the model.
the material is super soft too. it is also easy to get on and off which is sometimes difficult with rompers.
plan on wearing it with gladiator sandals and a jean jacket.",1
"I ordered this skirt in a size small and when i received it, not only was it too long, but there was also a hole in it. so i returned it. when a small petite became available, i ordered it thinking it would fit better. i just received it and there is a hole in this skirt as well. both skirts also looked as if they had been worn; there was fuzz and lint all over the skirts. i like the skirt but i either have extremely bad luck or it's really bad quality.",0
"Pros: material is amazing, super soft and quality thickness (but not like uber this, just enough, it will last). also seems like it won't wrinkle much which would make it a great dress to throw in a bag for a trip. fits well in the shoulders, chest and the length is good.

cons: the ""waist"" line is really tight and really really high. i'm 5'8"", 150lbs and my usual medium is pretty tight. of course it hits me on the rib cage too, which is so weird. it's way higher than it should be.

I am not particularly large but i have thighs! this pair of pants was totally unflattering! my butt looked fine but everything else looked bigger and my legs looked like stumps. i now understand why it's on sale. you may like these pants if you are tall and thin legged. but otherwise skip them. plus the material seems like it would discolor or stain easily. i had a pair from retailer in the same material last year that developed an odd discoloration the first time i wore them.,0
"I don't have anything like these pants so was thrilled to purchase the coral. i found the pants ran slightly large, though i stuck with my regular 28"" and they are very comfortable.",1
Love! love! love! i got this jumper right before it started getting hot and it has been my go to all summer! fun night out with the girls.. perfect! walking around the mall... awesome! at work with a green vest... super! every time i wear this i get tons of compliments! did i mention it feels like you're wearing pajamas which in my book is everything! get it!,1
"I purchased both colors offered and love this light weight full of neat detail piece to layer with other tops. the material is very soft and stretchy making it easy to wear over another item. i love the little shirt tail detail in back along with the drawstring trim in front. another piece that i am sure i will wear for years to come and the fit is true to size.
thanks antro!",1
"This dress is flattering, but size up. tight through chest in my normal size.",1
"I loved this skirt. so flattering and such a beautiful fabric. unfortunately after only 2 wears, the waistband stretched out so much that it was falling off me (literally). i bought the right size and it was not too tight. the waist band material simply lost its stretch very quickly. very disappointing.",0
"I vacillate betwixt saying this shirt runs large and small. i usually wear a small in retailer items, but the xs was all that was left in the charming bee print. the fit is flattering even though it's smaller than my usual size. conclusion: runs large. however, when i went to put my head through the top of the shirt, it was like being birthed. conclusion: runs small. bottom line: i'm in love with this shirt and so i'll just have to get used to the faux birthing feeling every time i put it o",1
"The fabric is really itchy, i felt like i was wearing a carpet, and it reminded me of the 70's fabric crimplene. this will not be comfy in humid weather. the top also had a strange synthetic odor.it was returned.",0
I ordered a small and the top part was huge yet the bottom a little snug. you need a big chest and small legs and bottom. too bad. it's very cute.,0
"I was really excited to receive this caftan, but it looked very strange on my body. i have small shoulders and the xs was still very big on me. there's also a seam along the sides that made me look boxy. the quality is really great, but i thought that the color seemed a tad bit darker/muted than pictured.",0
Love this dress.  the color is beautiful.  runs large so size down,1
"Wonderful print and color. dress style is very boxy and oversized, fabric is great but has no drape.",1
"I was so excited to receive this top!!! the material and design is gorgeous but it is way way way too short!!! i'm 5'7"" with an hourglass shape/average build and it barely hit the top of my pants! it otherwise fit true to size. so disappointed!!!! and for the price, it really should be cut better.",0
"The tops looks fitted on the model because she pressed her arms against the clothes. to my surprise,
the tops actually is very very very r o o m y below the chest area.
the appliques/laces on the front are made of low quality materials.",0
"I love this dress. it's an unusual material and really adorable in person. the problem was that it runs so large that i couldn't make it work. i'm usually an xs regular. the xs swallowed me. so then i ordered it in a pxs and pxxs because i really wanted it to work. only the pxxs fit, but it was so short that there was no way i could make it work. and i'm only 5'1"". i am 51 years old so i am not comfortable wearing ultra short dresses. maybe a person who doesn't mind really short would be able to",0
Material is gorgeous and soft but the fit is another story. i am a size 12/14 but very small busted. this suit is definitely meant for someone with a larger chest. the padding was so overwhelming. i also have a long torso so it just didn't really line up were the peplum should be. too bad. it's very pretty. but looked horrible.,0
"I received this top and loved the pattern. however, i ordered both and s and m, and the bust sizing on this top is very odd. i am a 34c, and the bust area was way too big on both, but if i had sized down to the xs the rest of the suit would be too small. maybe it's just made for busty people? also the supportive material in the bust area goes straight across kind of like a bandeau, so that added to the odd look of the bust. it's still a beautiful pattern, so if you're going to give it a try orde",0
"This is one of my favorite tops! i have it in two colors. it's almost like a swing look, yet it still feels like it gives me a shape to my body. very easily paired with a skinny jean. i paid full price for th two, but now i'm sure i'll buy the third on sale!",1
"This dress is super super pretty. it is very dull light blue grey, very romantic with the black blow. very very pretty, i love it! my only complaint is that it ""balloons"" up a bit due to the fabric. it is very fitted for me, i think if it were a tad loose fitting it would not balloon up around the curves as much. it is short and comes a little above the knees. i love this dress for it's romantic look, it can be paired with leggings as well.can't wait to wear it.",1
"Love this shirt, bought this shirt, returning this shirt. believe this and the other reviewers who say it runs small, especially through the bust, and even if you're not busty. it's now sold out in my size, wish i'd gotten a bigger size that i could keep!",1
"I love the designs of tiny blouses. but i wish they could make them more durable. i have owned several blouses in the past where i have to use a little pin to secure the button line from pulling at the breast area, or that after a few delicate washings have come apart at a seam. and ironing or steaming them is a must. this blouse was no exception. it went back because of pulling at the bust. i'm willing to take some extra care of my clothing out of my busy schedule, but i shouldn't have to! 5'7""",0
"This blouse is very pretty, but it does gap at the top button. darn! such a hassle to have to return it, or exchange it. but i love it and otherwise it seems to fit.",0
Such a pleasant surprise. i saw this in the store and had to try it on. it looks and feels like a lightweight real suede. the color is a wonderful neutral-much prettier than what i am seeing in the pic here. fits tts. although i will wear 0-2 petites in dresses and some pants i found the regular xs to be just right.,1
"I was able to purchase this on sale and i'm so glad i did. i usually go between a size s and m (133 lbs., 5' 5"", 34 d) but the small fits perfectly. the color really isn't dark orange as stated......kind of a cross between rose/pale red/ salmon but i really love the color. it's not super heavy weight but not really thin either....actually perfect!",1
These shorts were beautiful!! love the material and the way they fit. the drawstring makes them very adjustable.,1
"I ordered a bunch of clothing from retailer last week, and this is by far my favorite purchase! the detail is gorgeous, it's very soft, and figure flattering.",1
It turned out exactly as i'd hoped - very well made and very classy!,1
"This jacket is the best! definitely my staple jacket for the spring. it is so comfortable and soft. i usually wear a small in retailer clothing, but i opted for the medium in this so there's a little room for layering. even with the extra room, it is so flattering. i absolutely love this jacket!",1
"I love this tank, it is casual and comfortable, but has the little scarf attached to it, so sweet and styling. i tried on the xs regular, and would need petite, it was a bit long on me, but some people may prefer that. i also wonder about getting xxs only because it is a looser-fit tank. both colors are nice and neutral, good piece to add to a transition wardrobe. (115 lbs, 30 dd, 26.5 in waist)",1
"Trying the gray version on in the store, i found that the size of the armholes varied greatly within the same size. i am a 32c, 5'6"", 120 lbs. bought the size s. the top looks great with a faded denim skirt and is also appropriate for office environment. i also ordered the ivory in a s, but again, the armholes were so large that i had to return it. if you decide to try this top, order it in multiples of two sizes to find one that fits your arms.",1
"I love the idea of this shirt, but the execution is absolutely horrible. i ordered online and what i received is just a mess. the stitching at the bottom has big globs of black thread. not just a few hanging off, but literally big clumps. a large portion of the stitching on the whole shirt looks like it should be on the underside of the shirt as the where the thread is tied off is on the outside!! the fit is just as big a mess. i always have to buy a large in fitted shirts because i have very br",0
"I have other stevies, and these are nothing like them. the quality is very synthetic to a point that the material is shiny. the pants themselves run very small in the waist, approx. two sizes too small compared with other stevies. additionally, the cuff is sewn like that in place, and hits at an odd spot if you are taller or have strong calves. see how it gapes in the cuff on the model? like, a rounded bottom? that is way more emphasized in real life. buyer beware!",0
"This jacket is as cute as it looks in the picture, color is very close too. i normally wear a 4-6 top (sometimes s sometimes m). the small looked great until i tried to raise my arms - the cut runs a bit small acrossed the back). i love this jacket though! the m fits nicely and i highly recommend it!",1
"1st, this jacket fits true to size. 2nd, the shoulders are too tight (design--not sizing), as other reviewers have noted. it's such a beautiful design and material, so it's unfortunate that the shoulders are so tight the jacket is a little impractical.

i purchased this jacket with 40% off sale price. i'm not sure it's worth it for such oversight on shoulder mobility.",0
"Really love this jacket! i agree with the previous review that while the x small fits great when i am standing--it is a little hard to raise my arms in it. however- it is great to wear over a dress or with jeans at the office. great quality- lined with jersey. i've gotten many compliments! (5'8, 120 lbs, xsmall)",1
"I have been struggling to find a nice flowy summer dress that isn't too short. i am petite but do not like to wear my dresses too far above the knee, so i ordered this in the 00 regular. this dress was not what i expected. it is not flowy, but rather a heavy and stiff fabric. it is also way too wide. it looks like it can't decide whether to be a box or a bag. it is also shorter than advertised. last thing to disappoint was the color - darker and more muted than the photo on the website. i can't",0
"These jeans are one of my all time favorite ag jeans. comfortable denim, dark rinse. wide cuffs are fashionable but still classy. wear them all the time!",1
"I totally agree with the last reviewer. i'm 5'2"" 115 pounds with somewhat wide shoulders. the x-small fit my torso but was so tight in my shoulders i couldn't move my arms. the small was better but was too big in the torso. the material itself was really nice. too bad the fit was so awkward and unflattering.",0
"I love these jeans. they are very comfortable and do not stretch excessively after wear. i found the cut to be very flattering and the material to be heavy enough to hold its shape while still having enough give to move around and chase after little ones. they look great paired with a v-neck and flats or cute blouses and heels. a great buy! like another reviewer i, too, found these ran a little small and went up a size.",1
I finally found these jeans!! love them and have been wearing them almost everyday!,1
"I bought this top for my 15 year old daughter, and she thinks it is beautiful. it's very comfortable, and good for days that are not too cold, but not too warm. lovely!",1
I really liked this cardigan. it is well made and very pretty. i will wear it when it gets a little cooler in early fall because i tried to wear it on one of these really hot days and it felt little too warm.,1
"This is the perfect casual yet stylish dress. and, it's extremely comfortable!",1
"But i didn't like the fit. maybe because i ordered petite and the length threw me off, but they weren't flattering in any way. the color and material were unique and pleasing. had to send them back though.",0
"I have a collection of this artist's paintings throughout my home. she is a favorite. i was so excited to see the first clothing item offered at retailer. i ordered it at full-price. it looks the same in person as in the photos. the fit was true to size--it fits me as shown on the models. the knit was comfortable. the problem was the printed fabric. it was so flimsy and kept attracting static. no matter what i tried, i couldn't get the static problem solved. it was unwearable because of how messy",0
"I love the colors in this top, but sadly i'm going to have to return it. the first thing my husband did when he saw this on me was just stare, and not in a good way. then he said it looked like a maternity top. i was so disappointed, and sadly will be returning this. for reference, i am 135 pounds. 5-ft. 4-in tall and do not want to look pregnant in a top. i normally wear size medium tops, but this one is huge. now i know why the model in the picture had her arms nestled in at her sides. this to",0
"As another review said, the model's pose doesn't do this dress justice and i can't believe this is on sale. i picked this up this weekend at my local store. it fits wonderfully, very flattering. the fabric feels good and i'm fairly certain won't wrinkle too easily which is going to make this the perfect dress for packing for a trip. dress it up with boots for dinner, dress it down with sandals for day. this is a steal, get it! (i'm 5'8"", ~145, the size 8 fit perfect)",1
Way too long...the sizing is incredibly off on this product. order a size or two down.,0
"This cardigan is very similar to the c keer wrapped asters cardigan from a few years ago....i have this cardigan and have loved wearing it; i think it only came in cream color. unfortunately, i caught the cutouts a few times, and the cutouts are slightly ripped in 2 spots...not very noticeable, but i know they're there! so i was delighted to see that retailer brought back this cardigan, this time from meadow rue. i purchased both the cream and gray colors in a size small....i am usually a s",1
"Loved the styling, versatility, fit & quality of this top! length was good, not too fitted, perfect piece under cardigans & jackets. will look great with jeans, leggings or skirt. very happy with this purchase.",1
"Love these pants- they are so soft and comfortable- do not fall down like low rise trousers.  i like the length for wearing with flats - most wide bottom pants are too long, and these are very casual to be worn with flats.",1
"I love this top! the colors are beautiful & look incredible with jeans as well as so many of the different color pilcro pants in my closet. it's the perfect between-season item.
since i don't like garments that have a ""boxy"" fit, i was concerned that this top wouldn't work for me after reading some of the other reviews. but it looks great & feels comfy.",1
I got this in the brown and absolutely love it. this is perfect for cool weather. i'm super particular about fabric quality and this cardigan does not disappoint,1
"Love the cut and the way they drape. size 26 and 5'6"" 135lbs fit great until you wear them for an hour. all of a sudden my 26s became 28s. they were practically falling off. i plan to wash them to see if they shrink. i wish they held their shape since they are so cute.",0
"The top looks better on the model than in-person. it fits loose and looks boxy and matronly. i don't like the sleeve length or the top style, it just didn't look flattering or good. i am sending it back. looks very boxy.",0
This is a beautiful top! extremely classy. looks great with dressy trousers or jeans. drapes very nicely. the petite medium fits me perfectly (5'1 126 lb). love it! the embroidery ads so much. so pleased with this purchase!,1
"I bought a size small in this dress even though i am usually a large at retailer. it just hung strangely and clung to the unflattering parts of my body but seemed very large. i loved the feel, color (grey) and style of the dress, but i ended up returning it because of the fit. it also requires something under it since it is fairly see-through.",0
Love the design and print. absolutely beautiful bathing suit. would size up on the bottoms. top is true to size.,1
"Got this in the blue and was so excited. while it looks cute, someone had clearly bought this, worn it, and returned it. it had human and dog hair all over it. not to mention some kind of red strings. it was pilling all over. so much for quality control!!! i don't mind buying used things but at least clean it up and give me a discount!",0
"I was really excited to receive this dress but was disappointed that it really wasn't that special. i'm 134 lbs, 5'5"" and i ordered a regular size s and it did fit. i prefer my dresses right above my knees but this was probably 2 inches above the knees. it just wasn't that flattering nor worth the price. i expected to be wowed but wasn't!",0
"Colors washed me out, i need more vibrant colors. so cute on the model",0
Really wanted to love...but...the way it fit..lower part a tad too flowy...almost maternity like to hide a belly and the top area feels like my chest is being smushed! despite my bra size being a modest 36b...the look it gave was square on top almost block like with bottom that had flare...such a pretty top unfortunately the overall design just didn't work me.,0
I am so glad i ended up with these pants. wasn't ready to pay full price but ordered them immediately on sale & realized they were definitely worth every penny of full price. they are so soft & have so much detail. these pants are just gorgeous. i'm 32 and can't wait to wear these to cabo!! they may run a little large.,1
"Love this dress and its versatility! great design concept. fabric is pretty soft, cozy, and warm, as well. i found the dress to run large. i ordered a medium in the gray and small in the rose. i did like both colors irl, but the size small was the best fit. for reference, i'm 5'6"", 135 lbs, and wear a 6. the size small hit just above my knees and the sleeves reached down to my knuckles. i wore this around the house for awhile and realized that while the knit was nice and tight when i first put i",1
"This top is very pretty, i ordered both xs p and xxs p not knowing (someone wrote the word boxy in the review) - i tried on the xxs p first, and that was fine. did the trick to not look too boxy. teh fabric is stretchy, and soft/comfortable, not scratchy lace. the lining is soft as well. color is ivory and the embroidery is nice and fiery colors. the sleeves are fairly flattering, even on bigger arms. arm hole was just right too, never know with fluttery sleeves. 
for reference i am 115 lbs, 30",1
"I have been looking for a quality pair of black skinny jeans for a while. after reading the reviews, i had such high hopes for these jeans. i bought it in my usual size 28 and while the top part fit perfectly, i found that the bottom was too tapered in and ultra skinny making it not look right. sadly, i had to return.",0
"The lace on this top is pretty, and i liked the way it was styled in the product photos, but did nothing for me on. between the loose sleeves and the boxy cut of the front, it just sort of hung shapelessly on me. i also found the back to be much shorter than 30.5""--it came to a few inches below my hips and was not tunic length like i expected. the shoulders fit me well, and because the top was boxy already, i didn't want to size up for length. for reference i tried on xs (i'm 5'4"", 120 lbs).",0
"I am undecided if i will keep this dress or not. i am 5/4, 155 lbs and ordered both the small and medium. the medium was comically large on me, with broad shoulders and a sack-like appearance. but the small fit very well and felt very french girl chic. the brownish-greenish color is really stunning in person, like a greenish copper. and the gathered sleeves elevate this into a dressier look. but the material is sheer, so you would need to wear a slip, and the elastic waist still has somewhat of",1
"I was in love with this top from the moment i put it on. it is of high quality, with layers to ensure the top isn't sheer. the embroidery is so pretty and the top looks way less grandma in person. i ordered the petite xxs and it fits perfectly. i really appreciate that the underarm holes are just the right size and don't show off any of my bra, which sometimes happens with sleeveless tops. i can wear it with jeans and boots or with a pencil skirt and heels and it looks great with both outfits. o",1
"The picture makes it looks like it has rich brown yellow and orange colors. when it came, it was more black with some orange that popped. much different then i expected. the material was nice and silky but i was not willing to keep something that was dry clean only. i sent it back.",1
"Great top! i'm 5'7"", 135lbs and normally wear either an xs or s. i ordered the white to start with and decided to go back for the other 2 colors. it's a great basic to wear with pants/shorts/skirts, but the side slit and slant set it apart from a regular tank. i opted for the small in this top just because of where the side slit hit.",1
"There isn't much shape to this dress. it's fairly straight from top to bottom. i'm smaller on top with a small waist but slightly pear shaped. the top half was somewhat loose but the bottom half just clung too much. i'm 5'2"" and 107 lbs and bought a pxs for reference. also, i wore a tee shirt underneath and the dress shed all over it.",0
"This is a pretty dress. like the positive reviews have noted.
very figure flattering",1
"I love sweater dresses and was excited to find a dress that would be long enough for me to feel comfortable in. i am petite, but at my age i am not comfortable in things that fall more than an inch or two above my knee. this dress is much shorter than stated, and much shorter than it looks on the model. i measured the petite xxs (my normal size) and it is 31"" from the shoulder seam to the hem, not 36"" as stated. five inches is a big discrepancy. the color and style were lovely, but i just can't",0
This dress is super bulky and unflattering. the knit is loose and see-through. looks like it was knitted by a five-year old. if you need a dress that adds twenty pounds then this is for you. back to the store it goes,0
"This blouse runs large, billows out slightly, and hangs in a boxy straight way. i'm normally a medium but can probably wear a small in this blouse. the blouse is lined with a light-weight material but i can still see through it just a little bit. although very pretty, the blouse can snag easily so be careful when wearing. regardless, i plan to return for a small because this blouse is beautiful and unique. perfect for fall with its warm colors or summer because it's light weight.",1
"I love the lacey design of this top. however, it is very wide and doesn't fit well on someone with a small frame. i tried ordering a petit size. the width was better, but this size was too short. in addition, the lace didn't lay very flat, and there were lose threads all over. overall, not worth the price.",0
I purchased this dress online and it just didn't fit my body very well. it also arrived with a pretty sizeable hole so i can't say that i'm impressed with the quality. there were other areas too where was a loose thread which i'm sure will develop into another hole eventually. returned.,0
"I love love love the soft fabric and the cozy cowl. however mine not only had a giant hole, it seemed like the yarn started pilling as soon as i touched it. love the idea, but not practical, even without a hole =)",0
"Maeve is one of my favorite retailer designers. usually fall in love with a blouse, only to look at the tag and discover it's by maeve (go figure).
this top is just atrocious though. does nothing for girls with a larger chest. very boxy and unflattering. gorgeous colors though, and the sleeve concept is cute. however, where the sleeve meets the shirt looks cheap and thrown on. not impressed.",0
Colors are much more vibrant in person. love this skirt. true to size. makes a statement and is still classy.,1
"Such a lovely shirt and even though it is white, flowing and delicate it is not see-through so you will not have to worry about wearing an undershirt in the summer sun. lovely top!",1
"The colors look better in person and the sweater knit is thinner than i expected (which is actually a plus in my opinion) so i was very happy when i opened the package, unfortunately the fit was off for me. the lower part and the back are perfect, the dress hangs nicely, no puffing, no stiffness. however, the upper part at the front was tight and something about the armholes made my arms and upper body look beefy (i promise i usually don't have this problem). i am 32a and routinely order xs. the",1
"I adored this when i saw it online, paired with the leather skirt. i waisted impatiently for it to show up and, when it did, was happy at the price point but unsure of how it would feel. for the cut, i would say it runs tts. i am sometimes an xxs but in this case that size was tight across the shoulders. i am worried that the xs will be too roomy in the waist but time will tell. as for quality, well, you can feel the polyester in it, for sure. it's nice to have the lining, but i would not say it",1
This sweater dress color is great and texture is nice however ran huge. read the other reviews before ordering and ordered down to a medium and was just to boxy and could not get it to hang well. unfortunately it went back.,0
I just received this blouse and love it...more beautiful in person..i got the black one in a petite and it is perfect...if you want it longer in the front order a regular.,1
"I decided to give these trousers a try, despite my reservations about the appropriateness of the flowered embroidery on the fabric, given my age. girls and younger women can wear these types of pattern in public, but not me. for me, it seems too much like pajama wear, so wearing them as house clothing also didn't appeal to me. i'll be returning them.

the length is why i took off one star. how many petites have a 31"" inseam? i would need to have them hemmed. if you're looking for loose fitting,",1
"I really thought from the picture that the dress would be more fit for a curvy figure. it is, unfortunately, more well suited to those women with straighter lines. the color was more flat than the picture as well, but i bet it is lovely in navy.",0
"This may be one of my favorite purchases from retailer in a long time. i really appreciate the unique design, a quality that has drawn me to retailer for years. the cute little quirky owls are as rich in color as they are in personality. i'm don't typically favor cheaper polyester blends though the texture feels fine on my skin. this top definitely runs small and i had to size up to get the fit and length i desired. overall, i am very pleased and have received lots of compliments after wearin",1
"I splurged on this top and was sadly disappointed. i'm a 36d, and the l was so tight i couldn't get it over my chest. also the arms were super tight and the length is nearly cropped.  and the fabric is shiny, the picture makes it look like it's matte. if it did fit like the model i would've loved it. the print is beautiful though. bummer",1
"I really wanted to love this suit, but it honestly looked really matronly in person.",0
An awful dress! retailer why didn't you post my last review. i would not even give it a quarter of a star.,0
"Recently started loving rockets. i own a pair in black and a pair that are distressed. i've found that the 27s fit me best. i am 5'7"", 34c, 28 waist. this particular pair seems to run true to size, meaning i could get the 28s on (which is typically what i wear in other brands), but the 27s were embarassingly too small. while the 28s fit, and are made of a great weighty denim, with very little stretch, the wash was really not appealing. due to the distressing of the wash, all the lines butterfly",0
"My favorite colors are purple and green, so when i was in the store and saw the beautiful purple flowers on the top of this blouse and all up and down the sleeves, i was was blown away. i was disappointed by the bottom of it, just huge, flowy, green fabric with no design on it whatsoever. i went with my first impression and bought it, but now that i'm trying it on in the house, i'm still bothered by the throw-away bottom of this blouse. i'm thinking this is just another retailer maternity t",0
"I was so smitten by this shirt when i saw it online. i love embroidery and purple is my favorite color. i am a size 10 and decided to order an l. the shoulders fit well, but the rest of it was huge...like another reviewer said...like a maternity top. i would also concur with the reviewer who said "" [what] takes away from the lovely purple flowers is the blotchy moss dye finish on the fabric."" this is so true. the embroidery does not stand out / is not highlighted like in the photograph; they hav",0
"I love this suit! the pattern is just lovely. unfortunately i have to return the suit because i can't wear it. there are no cups or pads or underwire for the chest. you have to look like the model wearing the suit to wear this. if you need any support than give up. who can wear an xl and not have some breasts at all? the neckline is also very low and ended up revealing the top half of my breasts.

the birds of paradise are just lovely, not exactly the same on every suit, but still nice. i just",0
"It's a lovely pattern on a soft tee. the fit is similar to how it looks on the model, not clingy at all. it should be noted that it's fairly see-through. if i wear a bra that's close to skin color it's not an issue, but it is obvious if you're wearing any kind of patterned or contrasting bra. i suppose you could wear a cami underneath, but it's too hot for that in florida and i think it defeats the purpose of a t-shirt. overall, i'm very happy with this, though i'm also very very happy i got thi",1
"When i saw this shirt, i knew i had to have it! i got the white with yellow flowers, and the pattern is perfectly charming. i'm 5'2"" and petite with a short torso. the petite xs fit me perfectly! the material is pretty thin, so i hope it stays in good shape. until then, i can't wait to dress this up for work and dress it down for casual summer days.",1
"I am about 5'6"", 135 lbs and usually wear between a small or a medium. i ordered a small, as another reviewer did. right when i took it out of the packaging, i could see that it was going to be much shorter than you can tell from the online photo. i knew the sweater was going to be cropped, but it falls right at the top of my hip bones. when i raise my arms up, my whole midriff shows. did not flatter my athletic build at all. the fit around the shoulders and chest is fine, skimming but not tight",0
I love the cut and fit of this t. it's soft and has just enough flow to be comfortable without being unflattering. the gray floral print is very pretty. it's perfect with jeans or shorts in the summer.,1
"Cute shirt but it is very hard to wrap my head around being an xxs. sizing is ridiculous. and now that i have an xs that is too big, the xxs are sold out. typical.",1
"I love this t-shirt, i wish it came in tons of other prints! very soft, almost feels lived in, and high quality all the same.",1
"These shorts just didn't work for me. i loved the embroidery and the color, but i just don't have the curves for them. try these if you have an hourglass or fuller figure.",1
Very nice fabric and quality but runs very large. i had to return my pair of a size 0. stinks to pay for shipping on a product that looks so different in the picture.,0
Very soft! i sized up. was able to wear without a cami underneath,1
I tried on about 25 items in the store today and didn't buy anything but if i had bought just one thing it would have been this great floral t-shirt (i may have to go back for it). the combination of the very soft material and faded look of the pattern gives it the look and feel of an old favorite tee shirt. the fit is exceptional as well- not too loose or too snug. i would definitely snap it up on sale and may even have to cave to the full price.,1
"It's a t-shirt. a very cute print, nice cut, very soft--but a t-shirt. therefore, why is it almost $50???? tried it on in the store and loved it, but i just can't justify $50 for a t-shirt.

for those who will not be deterred by the price: i normally wear about an 8-10 dress size at retailer, and the medium fit well.",1
"This tee is so soft and comfy. it looks nicer than a regular tee but still casual. fits true to size, and not too loose, but not too clingy. i know i'll wear this one a lot!",1
"I like the look of this tee and the fit is fine but it's described as a ""cotton-rayon jersey"" and in fact it's 50% polyester. i would not have ordered if i had known and now have to take it back.",0
"I loved this t-shirt in the gray motif so much, went back to get the yellow:-) both go great with pilcro hyphen chinos. while the fabric is a little thin, it's super soft and just the perfect length.",1
I ordered the yellow. i love this shirt it such a happy print. can match a lot of things.,1
"I wear an 8-10 and these are a little big on me, which is surprising. they also don't lay really flat in the back. the pockets are inside in the back, in side two layers, and don't lay very flat. the crotch is low and rides up when i walk.
i'll probably wear them again, but i'm not totally thrilled by them.",0
Such a great purchase! it can be dressed up or down and seems to go with everything! great for summer!,1
"I ordered this on-line. while it fits well before washing, the fabric is a bit thin. i'm afraid it might shrink in the wash, too. i haven't worn it yet because i'm trying to decide it i will keep it or return it. colors are a bit more muted than i would like also.",1
"This blouse is very pretty, but the overlap in the front is a little ""strange."" it seems to fall open and will require either a pretty pin to hold it closed or a cami underneath. despite that ""flaw"" i am glad that i purchased this blouse. the trim at the shoulders gives it a romantic and special appeal.",1
"This shirt is so comfortable and soft. it has a great fit. it is a little thin, but i can get away with wearing it by itself. i love it!",1
"I purchased this towards the end of winter because it reminded me of spring time! it is such a lovely soft tee, with a delicate flower design. i wear it with jeans. it always makes me feel happy.",1
"Great fabric, great fit, great shirt. just found my new favorite for this summer!!",1
"I purchased this in the yellow for my daughter and she has not seen it yet. the style is very cute, but the fabric is quite thin. she will have to make that call, but if i had bought it for myself, it would be going back. i'm not willing to wear a camisole under a t-shirt. it also feels like the kind of knit fabric that shrinks and skews when it's washed, so that remains to be seen.",0
I debated forever about ordering this and so glad i did! the colors are so pretty. i got the yellow and it's slightly sheer but ok w/ a nude bra. regarding fit- completely tts imo. i'm a 8/10 and 38 c and the med is perfect. i am so happy i did not size up.,1
"I got this piece because it was so unique.. that's one of the things i love so much about retailer: not afraid to go where no woman has gone before, so i ordered it in a 4p, my usual size, and a 4. i am petite, but the 4 worked perfectly, i think. i am pretty voluptuous below the waist and medium to small on the top and the 4p was too small all over - so i would agree that it runs small.

the quality is excellent, the look is great. my husband liked it on me. it might work for the office with so",1
"I bought this at the store and when i picked it up i didn't think much of it until i tried it on! it is so adorable, i can't even tell you how much... i am 48 yo and normaly buy xs/s or 2/4 in retailer. mauve dresses are 2 most of the time. small chest, 5'5"" and about 130lbs and i got the size 4 and it is perfect! i hope it is age appropriate tho... ;) i have traveling plans this summer and i am thinking this could be an easy thing to take along with me, one piece clothing that will travel very we",1
I absolutely love this sweater. it is a beautiful deep blue color. i love the unique cuff on the sleeves.. i feel it does run a bit big but once you pull the strings it shortens up dramatically. looking forward to late summer and early fall so i can wear it!,1
Make sure to get the whole outfit. the skirt sits high enough so that it avoids the muffin look.,1
"I found this dress to be beautiful. only down side? you'd need to size up two sizes if you have any breasts or butt. i'm usually size s/m in maeve. i bought this in l and looked like a stuffed sausage. i'm 5'1"", 140lbs, 36d, 39"" hips. i'd need an xl.",0
"So glad i gave this a try. looks so much better on than seeing it online!!! i doubt i will ever wear it tied, but it's very cute and comfortable. it will probably be my go-to sweater to throw on over summer clothes when the ac is too cold. it would even be great to throw on over workout clothes! 
fits tts.",1
"Love ag jeans!! a little on the pricey side...but so worth it. the harper style is just enough higher wasted so i can actually bend over and not worry about anyone seeing anything other than my jeans :) but not too high waisted. these jeans keep their shape still with a little strestch to them. i am 5'5,, and 111 lbs and if not wearing under boots would have to a0 alter or b) wear as these are in the picture because they'd be too long for me. but i would purchase these all over again. love these",1
"They have some stretch, so if you are between sizes, order down. they are very long, which for me is a good thing!",1
"I really like the soft, flowy satin fabric and vibrant color of this dress! i am 5'5'' 125lbs, the s was too large, so i ordered the xs instead. things to note: pockets, elastic waistband with nice detailing on the sides, slip underneath, and large flutter sleeves. i think that women with smaller torsos should consider petite sizing.",1
"The fabric and design of this piece are so unique.  i am skeptical of wide leg designs in product photos because the fabric is often much more voluminous irl than it appears, which is the case for this jumpsuit.  despite the extra volume, the fabric weight gives it a structured look which makes the wide legs look fantastic on.  there is a silicon grip band around the top that allows you to wear it strapless, though it doesn't seem very functional to me without boning or more structure to the sid",1
"This looks great on. i'm busty, so it's a little awkward to zip under the armhole, but not bad. a little bit tight in the bust, but the smocked back stretches to accommodate. 
i just wish the description had mentioned that it has silicone gripper across the front neckline. i have a sensitivity to this type of coating/elastic and generally avoid it, since it causes my skin to turn red and break out in blisters. the jumpsuit looks so great on that i will keep it and either remove the gripper or s",1
"The fit on these is good for my hourglass shape, and the fabric quality and comfort is good too.i think the rinse is just not as nice in person- the orange stitching is pretty bright too. i bought. a pair from br a couple months ago that are almost identical in quality, fit and color that i got for less than half the price of these. i am going to return these and see if they have something better , but will only buy in store from now on.",0
"I really, really wanted to love this jacket. unfortunately, i have a long torso and it was a weird length on me. it hit touching my waist and i wanted something a little longer. i am 5'6"", but long waisted. this probably fits beautifully on someone more short-waisted or petite in stature. it was beautiful (although the buttons were cheap...)",0
"I really wanted to love this dress but unfortunately the length of the ruffle up top is not flattering on someone with a large chest. if you are d or smaller, it will probably be perfect. 

great material, color, and feel. so bummed i had to return it",1
"I bought the stained glass top/bottoms. the print is very pretty. however, the tankini top itself is not well-made. the front of it (chest area) turns out so that you can see part of the inside of the suit (which is white). it doesn't lay flat around the top, and so it shows more of your chest on one side. for the price, i don't think it is worth it. i don't like to wear it because it makes me feel uncomfortable.",0
"I bought the mosaic pattern in a small. the pattern and colors look much better in person. the design and quality are solid. the top runs small. it is difficult to put on, but stays in place. i would recommend.",1
"Bought this in the store and fell in love with it. very soft and flattering to wear. however, after wearing it one day it is already starting to pill. this truly is a beautiful sweater, but i fear it will not be beautiful for long. i am willing to take the chance as i got it on sale.",1
"This top is very pretty and you can definitely wear it without a cami with a nude bra if you're an outgoing person, especially for a summer evening. my only confusion is the too high neckline. if it was just a little lower, it would look and feel less ""chokey."" i keep wanting to pull it down. i'm a size 0 and needed the xxs which fits like most people's xs's as sizing continues to get bigger. really lovely except for the neckline. looks great over white or colored shorts and is a nice mix of cas",1
I ordered this sweater online in a size xs and the order was cancelled because it was out of stock. i ended up finding a sm at my local retailer and was so happy! it worked just perfectly. i'm usually an xs but the sm worked great. it is a thick knit and may snag so i'm being careful with it. simply meant to be:),1
I got the off-white lace top and love it! quality is great for the price. comfortable and the lace isn't super delicate so it seems like it should last.,1
"This top is beautiful and i have received so many compliments on it. the fit is very complimenting, and i would continue to wear it often except that the fabric is unraveling. the bottom of the lace has raw edges so i would expect some fraying there but my top is shedding long streaks of material with each wear throughout the entire top, 1-5"" strands of the lace unraveling isn't exactly a great look.",0
"These pants are gorgeous--the fabric has a satiny stretch that simply feels decadent on. i tried on the size 0 and 2 and though they both fit, the size 2 was more flattering (i'm 5' 8"" 120lbs). compared to cartonnier's capris (which i love and wear a size 4 in), the fabric and construction on these is superior. and the color is knockout red.",1
"I got this dress for my younger sister who's in the process of losing weight. she's currently wearing a size 12 with comfort room but can occasionally squeeze into smaller sizes depending on the product. this dress is deceptively true to size. at first glance it looks like a roomy dress but the inner part of the dress zips up real tight. as a result, the boxy top part of the dress doesn't look too big and is in fact very flattering. the dress is very silky and looks as high quality as its price.",1
The perfect summer top. paired with a small tank underneath and jeans and had many compliments!,1
Fits perfect!! tank top or bath top. swings nicely and not too tight on top. i ordered large and am a 38 d. sits perfect not long not short!,1
This will be a frequently worn item. print is beautiful and the fit is comfy and classy.,1
This dress attracted my attention with its victorian inspired print. the details are to die for. the blue is not the same as the picture. slightly darker and more muted.,1
It's a great addition for summer. defiantly need a tank on under it but very pretty.,1
I love the pattern of this shirt but there is definitely a design flaw in the arm/armpits.,0
"The lace on this looks like it would be stiff, but it isn't. it's soft and drapes nicely. i normally buy an xl (if it's not a knit) and so i did. the top will fit up to a size 18 in the xl because it is boxy and generous. it fit me perfectly and just tapered my body. it looks looser in the photo.

it's as see through as the photo. and, i wouldn't wear a cami under it. that defeats the purpose for hot weather imho. i think a nude bra works just fine. you can see the model is wearing a white bra",1
"Absolutely love this sweater because it is so pretty while being soft and comfortable. i am 5'4"" and purchased the small?it falls a little below my hips. while the color matches everything, the pockets and details add a nice touch and the longer sleeves are cozy. the only drawback is it pills and sheds.",1
Really great tank. fit runs a little small if you are tall.,1
"This simple lace top is beautiful and easy to wear, but do not wash it. the hem completely fell apart for me!",0
This has quickly become my favorite dress. i bought the turquoise dress and the color is so lovely. the fit is perfect and the lines are flattering and classic. this is one of those dresses that will never go out of style.,1
"I love everything by cloth & stone so was excited to see that they made a dress. hooray! i ordered it in the xl, which is my usual size in their shirts. when i tried it on i was so sad to see that it barely fit around my tummy and hips! i am a true size 12/14 and the xl just barely gave me enough room to move. my chest also caused the dreaded ""button gape."" it is clear that they cut the dress for people with a stick straight figure. so disappointing!!",0
"I love this dress in the photos, and like it enough to keep it--but i don't love it. it runs borderline true-to-size/slightly large. i'm 5'8"", 133 lbs, 34 b and usually wear a 6 in dresses. i ordered a sm and med. am keeping the sm. medium was way too big. my main issue is the amount of fabric in the skirt--it's a bit full. in the pics, this dress appears straight, but it's not. the higher waist and skirt's fullness gives it a more casual, youthful look, which is not what i want. but the quality",1
"I am 5'2"", 120lbs. and bought the 4 petite, which is what i normally wear, and it fits perfectly. the quality of the fabric and stitching is good, not great, and more what i would expect to see in a less expensive garment, but for me, the style, the fit and the fact that it doesn't seem to show wrinkles, at least not before washing, turned it in to a keeper for me. the drawstring ties in the back and i find it a little weird when you wear a belt with it. i tried the ada belt with it, but found i",1
"I waited to review as i ordered both colors and multiple sizes for comparison.

ivory is actually truly longer than the black, i wasn't sure from the photos on line, but having tried both on, ivory is longer (as shown online).

true to size/bigger: i am never sure if i should write true to size or big, but went with the xs petite (used to do everything in xs)... at 115 lbs, 30 dd chest, 26.5 in waist,t ehre was room to move super comfortably. petite for sure for me for both length at the kne",1
"This top is so unbelievably cute! the fit is perfect and it goes with just about anything on the bottom. i personally styled mine with high waisted distressed skinny jeans and it looks adorable. its a tiny bit see-thru, so you do need to wear a tank under it.",1
"Tried this dress in a small. i am 5'6"", 135lbs, 34c. the small was huge - the sash helped some, but looked like a potato sack on me. also, i noticed the fabric was piling slighly in the store. i had high hopes for this dress but left this one in the store.",0
"Tried the blue motif, size 6, regular.
i'm 5'6"" and if i were shorter i'd go with petite sizing.
stats: 34a-28-36 with broad shoulders, sometimes i go up to a size 8 in blazers but this was a perfect fit. side pockets, dress is unlined and quite lightweight. the tie has to be tied in back and i liked the clean lines this gives in front. nice and simple for when it warms up!",1
"I have these shirts in the blue and green and they were great. i'm 5'4"" c chest and athletic build - the small shirts fit pretty good and i love the fabric so i kept them. i really wanted these dresses to work but the cut was different even between the gray and burgundy. there was tons of room in the chest, but it was tight in the shoulders. i really wanted to love this, but there's just too many cut issues. it is a good length for work though.",0
"This is a cute top but the sleeves are super long.  they swallowed up my entire hand when i put my arms down to the side.  i also found it to run slightly large.  i ordered my usual medium and i had too much room under the armpits.  the sleeves weren't as fitted as the model shot either, which i would of preferred.  i probably could of shortened the sleeves, but didn't think this style top fit me so i sent it back.  this does not require a cami underneath.",1
"This dress would have been gorgeous and consistent with retailer's aesthetic if the designs had been embroidered onto a thick silk/jacquard fabric to give it texture, which is how it looks from the photo. obviously it would have been more expensive, but in any case, this was just a really expensive polyester dress, which it says in the product description, but i gave retailer the benefit of the doubt, thinking if anyone can make even polyester look like a quality product, it'll be retailer. but now i",0
"I ordered this dress in small, my usual size (for reference: 5'7"", 125 lb). it is too wide. it looks more fitted in the pictures and hangs loose on me. the belt does not help much; it still looks like a sack and i feel like a girl wearing her mom's dress.

also, i found that the material crumples easily.",0
"Love this dress! it fits perfectly, is flattering, and the fabric is high quality. i ordered the blue print, and it is a vibrant turquoise. i may order in the charcoal as well, as this is a comfortable, cute dress for everyday casual. i am 5'7, 135 lbs and the size 4 was perfect, even a tad bit loose, but i prefer a bit loose to tight, especially with the design with the buttons up the front.",1
"I bought the burgundy color in this shirt dress. usually wear a size 4 and xs in most brands. purchased the xs in this dress. i'm 5'4, 118#, 34d. the fabric is rayon however it feels more like a light flannel or soft brushed cotton. like you've worn it forever. the length says 40"" long but i found when worn with the belt it rides up substantially. about 2-3 inches above the knee. felt like i was squirming to pull it down. i normally wouldn't be drawn to something so simple but when i walked out",1
This dress is very lovely - ivory fits as pictured (slightly below knee) in ivory not as the black is depicted (much shorter). fits a little larger than expected and material is very stretchy.,1
"Lots of embellishment, striking magenta color, feels great on, with a flattering neckline that isn't too low. i recommend it!",1
"This dress is much better irl than pictured. when i saw it online i thought it looked very frumpy, but i tried it on in store and loved it. it's a perfectly draped shirt dress, and it ties to define the waist. a classic!",1
"I wasn't sure about this dress, and decided to give it a shot based on reviews, could not be happier. before trying it on i was worried about the length, and always worry about dreaded button gap at the chest, but none of that is an issue.",1
"I was nervous about this purchase, but it turned out to be a new favorite. the blue color is stunning on and i can easily see this taking me from work to dinner. i am normally a size 2 or 4 in dresses. after reading reviews about how this dress runs large, i ordered a 2 and hoped i didn't have to return it. the 2 is perfect and roomy. the drawstring can be let out or in for more figure definition. this really is a beautiful and modest dress.",1
"I ordered this on-line, in a size 8. the fit is ample and fine fine, and the fabric is acceptable, but as much as i wanted to like it, and keep it, i ultimately returned it. it is just too, too conservative for me. i loved the deep olive/khaki colour, and even experimented wearing it open as a duster over a top and slip pants, leggings, or skinny jeans, but the collar and the front pocket styling are just too man-tailored and cargo-like in their styling for me. i tried it with different belts, w",0
"While i love the fabric and the pattern, this skirt leaves too much to be desired. the full price is absurd considering what you get.
there is no mention online that there is no built in slip, and as the material is extremely thin a slip is an absolute must. (see attached photo.) even in dim lighting you can see straight through. 
also for this price point it is strange that the skirt is 'pull-on styling.' i would say that it is true to size, and i am usually a medium @ retailer, but i have a sm",0
"I was hoping to wear this dress on my wedding day before the ceremony. i'm 5'5"", 130 pounds, usually wear a 6. i ordered this dress in medium and it hangs off of me. it is not straight as it looks on the model, but bells out from the waist. the sleeves are so long that they covered my fingers.",0
"I loved how soft this dress was, as well as versatile. however, i only got to wear it one time because after the first wash, a giant fabric tear happened on one of the seams. unfortunately, the fabric is so soft, but rather thin, and it didn't hold. the care instructions say machine washable but i wouldn't put it in the washing machine again. especially since i often have to wash clothes twice in the washer i use because it's so old and barely agitates. would love this if it was made a little be",0
"This is my first maxi skirt and i am pleasantly surprised! i might not have purchased this had i not tried it on in store, but did for the fun of it and loved the shape and swing of the skirt. the material is a comfortable and substantial stretchy jersey fabric with an inner lining that keeps it from being sheer. though it is kind of a dark navy, i would agree with one of the previous reviewers that it could pass for a black and white pattern. for my sister's graduation, i paired it with a white",1
"I wanted to love this product so badly. i ordered it in the mail, and it looked beautiful coming out of the box. i normally look really nice in grey, but this color really washed me out and was not nice on. the fabric is very sheer, so you would have to wear it over a camisole/tank top. this is one of those pieces that looks better on the hanger than in person. large in arms, small on body. odd fit.",0
"This skirt has a great pattern and the stretchy fabric allows it to shape my body perfectly. adorable with a white-t, or a black one...great for a night out on the town and some sexy, strappy sandals! love this skirt!",1
"I think i own nearly every maeve skirt retailer has sold over the last five years, and this might be my new favorite. one major improvement over years past is the fit...it really is true to size, rather than running large as has been the case in the past. the material is a substantial, stretchy jersey with a nice texture. the weight of the fabric combined with the jersey slip means it's not sheer at all, and it also a nice smooth fit, skimming over less-than-perfect areas. i also really appreciate",1
"I couldn't be happier with this skirt! i was expecting a jersey-type material, but was pleasantly surprised by the thicker, textured, higher quality material. the ruffle on the front is such a cute feature. this skirt moves and flows very nicely when walking. it is lined and has an elastic waistband, it's super comfortable. so far i've paired it with a bright red knotted tee and a sheer white sleeveless button-down. i receive compliments every time i wear it! i'm 5'2"", 110 lbs, i ordered an xs a",1
This skirt fits amazing. i run between a s and m in bottoms and went with the s. there is a little give in the fabric which is always a plus. this will surely become a staple in my wardrobe.,1
I am in love with this skirt! it is the most flattering thing i have purchased in a while. the fabric is a beautiful medium weight knit with a good amount of give. it hugs your curves but doesn't cut in anywhere! i was able to easily go down a size from my usual. i love it so much that i am going to order the other color as well!,1
I wore this skirt immediately when my delivery arrived. nothing but compliments. i went right back to order the green and it has sold out. bummer - i would buy every. single. color. this skirt is that great!,1
"Again, maeve knocks it out of the park with this skirt! great quality, style and comfort! i love that it's machine washable. so great and versatile for work or a night out! this is not a ""con"" but might be a bit long for short ladies. i'm 5'6"" and it's below the knee.",1
"My only problem with the skirt was the length - it appears shorter in the pictures, and i can't take it up since it would mess up the front slit. i would have returned for the petite, but it was not available in the green color which i loved. even though the length is longer than i usually wear, i get non-stop compliments on the skirt. and, it's very versatile.",1
"These are the softest jeans ever! i love the way that they hold their shape, and make my bum look amazing!! i am 5'3"" and they do come much longer than shown on the model...right below my ankle bone. i actually prefer this because they will be wearable right through fall if i pair them with booties! the fit is true to size...108 pounds and i got a 25. highly recommend!!",1
"I ordered this online in a m and l because i am usually one of those on the bottom - i will be returning both for a s. the fabric is great and a cool pattern, but it runs large by far. in addition to the large sizing the fabric has a decent stretch so that makes it even larger. i think the small will fit well and the cut is flattering - i am about 5'11'' and it hits below my knees, similar to the model in the picture, so i would definitely get this in petite if youre on the shorter side. it's al",1
Love this skirt! i have worn it to work with a simple black shirt for a great outfit! i have had many compliments on it. it is very flattering and comfortable!,1
"I am sorry to say this blouse is way below all retailer standards. this top should have been placed on sale a long time ago! poor quality in cut, fabric, design. this is a top one would grab at a local box store for 19.99. the colors are not as vibrant. the shoulders ill fitted. and the fabric and threads are very cheap. i was expecting so much more.sorry retailer.....my favorite store to shop!",0
"Beautiful top but disappointed that the top was so sheer. i'm 5""2, 120 and i ordered my usual xs. fit perfectly but may exchange for a s as i was hoping for it to be a little longer (hits right below my waist).",1
"I purchased this shirt and was hoping to be able to wear it without a tank underneath (because of the lace detailing on the back). however, this shirt is a bit see-through, so i still had to wear a tank with it. it's very cute even with the tank though!",1
"I bought these a great alternative to black jeans but they are headed back.  the texture is nice but let's call them what they are- thin, leggings.  not worth the price in my opinion.  honestly, i can't seem to find a pair of pilcros that i like so i'd spent the extra money on a better pair of black jeans.",0
"I love the flowy-beachy look of this jumpsuit, it is very comfortable, and super cute, my only ""gripe"" is that the hip part is pretty wide, hands in the pockets, you can't tell, but if i were to get this, i would want a xxs. length was ok not petite since it is a flowy look. colors are very nice too, kind of ""70's"", but i love it. i think i will get this if it goes to sale, even if it is a little big on me... i am 115 lbs, 30d chest and tried on xs.",1
"I ordered these on sale despite a previous reviewer's comment that they were unflattering on the back side. they really do hug your bum, but that is not what bothers me. what bothers me is that the back side is totally see through, so unless you plan on wearing them with a long top, they are not wearable in public or around other people. i have gotten some of my favorite pieces from retailer, but also some of the most poorly designed. unfortunately, these fall in the latter category.",0
"Short of calling it dark gray- which  isn't dark, but that's fine because i saw the picture. it's everything i wanted it to be. i just wish it was chiller here in georgia so i can wear it more often",1
"This could worn with anything. tank top, long sleeves, gloves, jeans and pants. very high quality material. will be a staple in my wardrobe this fall!!!",1
"Super comfortable pant. they don't feel or look like jeans, but will hug your body like jeans. i bought the regular, size 26 - they waist is not tight and i needed to roll up the bottoms about 1.5 inches. i have not washed or dried these yet, but i imagine they will wash well.",1
"Like other reviewers have said, this is very sheer, look at the sleeve in the picture and you'll get an idea of how sheer the body is as well. the material posed challenges for it's creater because one top i tried on in the store had a sleeve that was smaller than the other, tight enough that it would have ripped if i weren't careful. tried on another identical top and the sleeves were a normal somewhat loose fit. bodice portion is much more intense pink in real life. loose, billowy, and perhaps",0
Beautiful skirt but does run small. i wear a small and am able to keep the skirt but have to be very careful about under garments since it is so tight. looks great though.,1
"I'm giving these leggings 5 stars although i did return them. first off i do love pilcro jeans and leggings. beware these are not jeans at all. the tag says serif legging. these are excellent leggings if that's what you're looking for. i thought they were jeans and was willing to spend the money on them, but not for leggings. i'll consider buying if they go on sale.",1
"I bought this in coral, it is soft and the fit is flattering. the perfect top for transitioning into fall here in the desert.",1
"Pretty tee, but not worth the price.  lace is beautiful, but fit is blah.",0
"This is a beautiful top, however it looks better on the 80 pound model. the shirt sits awkward on your chest if you have any cleavage and there is way too much fabric around the body. if you are any size beyond a 2 then it just makes you look bigger than you are.",0
"As soon as i saw this online i knew i'd love it, and when it arrived in my store i scooped it up right away!!! the poncho is exactly as it appears online. the color is different variations of gray. the fabric is soft and not itchy at all. it's longer in back, has arm holes on either side and lays beautifully. it's long enough to wear with leggings, but looks clean enough to pair with jeans and a top. this is light enough for cool summer nights, but will be my fall go to once the cold weather com",1
"This is a gem. stretchy, graphic, easy to wear, lightweight and so fun! the best thing about this is it can be worn as a jumpsuit or as a higher waisted pant! i've seen it paired with a pilcro denim jacket and cute sandals, and then worn as pants with a black tank, jacket and silver belt. i love that this can be dressed up or down...you could even throw it on over your bathing suit as a coverup. i would go true to size on this one since there is some room and the top has great stretch.",1
"I love this top and despite the higher price point, it came home with me. normally i tend to go for very basic colors - white, black, gray. but i saw this and was intrigued by the high neck and subtle cut away sleeveless style. tried it on and it was love. the fit is great. it is flowey, but without the maternity look in front and all that extra fabric in the back. it's just right. i love the print and i am so not a print person. i tried it on with some taupe skinny jeans and a denim jacket. per",1
I love the navy blue color. they are a fun alternative to skinny jeans. the fit is great and they are super comfortable!,1
"This is as pretty in person as it is online, good quality (except one item i'll get to), and fits true to size. i'm 5'6"", normally a medium/8, and the medium fit great in this top.
i almost kept this shirt...so close, i had it on a hanger, but i kept trying it on. the shirt is well displayed in the pics online, but unless you get close it's hard to see that the top button is set a little wide. every time i put it on, my eyes went to the top button (i did get a second opinion and they agreed)...",0
"I've never owned a romper before but after trying it on at the store, i fell in love! i'm pear-shaped 5""4 at 185#. i got a med and it fits beautifully with just enough room to not be baggy. i got the red mitif. super flattering.",1
"I purchased the one marked with the red dot (the one with the larger pattern and orange in it). i spied it in the store as soon as it arrived. i fell absolutely in love with it immediately. i am normally xl but this piece runs large so i tried the l and it's perfect. very bohemian, which i adore. first time out i folded over the top and wore it as pants and it looked fabulous with a black top. it can also be worn the way it is shown. i have also belted it and worn it with a black jacket, as show",1
"I love boys and arrows, but this top is really best suited to smaller size chests because there's no adjustable ties or straps or reinforcements for support. also, the fabric is super soft, which is great for feel but not so much for fit if you require a little boost! for my 32d's i chose a different design.",1
"I have a love hate relationship with this product. it is comfortable and cozy, yet unshapely. after the initial wear, the product begins to stretch out, and if you sit for a while your knees are demarcated in the fabric once you stand. the sherpa front is soft, but the waffle material in the back is in no way flattering. i purchased for sleeping so it does that job nicely, but i would never leave the house with this on. i am hoping that after the first wash it shrinks a bit too. i am typically a",0
"I bought this in white and coral. i usually wear xl, but both l and xl fit well. i bought coral in l and white in xl. it is a tad see-through but not a lot. the top is comfortable and looks very good on, coral is so dreamy and white perfect for a casual day out. i am not crazy about linen fabric though, it can be a bit scratchy, i would have preferred if the top were in a softer fabric. for now though i plan to keep both.",1
I really like the gentle flow of the fabric. this top can be worn casual or dressy by adding jewelry or or a scarf.,1
"I have this color also in the grey - flattering, interesting shirt. i have think hips but a fuller waist, the vertical lines of this shirt design suggest otherwise. great to pair with torn up skinny jeans! love the petite line now in portland.",1
"I am still in love with my ribboned denim dress from earlier this year. so, when i saw this dress i was super excited and ordered it right away in the same size. it just came and... i'm kinda disappointed. the fit is... shrunken?? kind of like i'm wearing a petite size. it's around 3 to 4 inches shorter, the tie at the waist hits instead right under my bust, and there's some weird bunching happening above my rear?? i kept wanting to pull the whole dress down more, but that's just the way it was",1
This is my new favorite dress. it's a lovely fall mustard shade. the design really accentuates the waistline. i would buy the other colors in a heartbeat. on my petite frame the dress hits just above my knees.,1
"I was on my way out the door when i noticed this adorable t-shirt and of course i grabbed one and went to try it on. i love it, it's a different take on a t-shirt. it's comfortable and stylish. i ended up buying the white one and gold colored one. i'm even thinking about grabbing a couple more colors.",1
"I didn't think top was very flattering and, while in the picture the mismatched hem lines in the collar looked cute in person it just looks odd. this is especially true of the back of the sort where the mismatched hem repeats at the bottom...just looks mis-sewn instead of purposeful. sadly this one is going back to the store.",0
"I purchased this dress on super sale and i'm so happy i did. it looks better on me than on the model and that's never the case. the material is soft corduroy with comfortable give. it moves with me. true to size (i ordered a size 8 and for reference, i'm 5'2"", 140lbs, 36c). love this staple fall/winter piece. i wore it to a conference for work with footless tights and a black cardigan. i can't say enough how comfortable it is on! it has a structured give if that makes any sense. love it!",1
"I really wanted to love this dress, but it just wasn't flattering on me. i have curves and i was hoping this would hug them in a joan on mad men way (sometimes these dresses that just hang on super thin models can look beautiful in a different way on a more voluptuous woman) but it was pretty shapeless on me. it also dips so low in the back that i would have to get a special bra to wear it. might be right for a more slender shape or someone who can go braless, but it didn't work for this short,",0
"Received this and love the style, but it falls just a little below my waist and i like my tops to be longer.  it'll definitely fit a shorter torso.",0
"The dress is true to size, but has generous stretch to it. i absolutely love this dress, i compliments where needed and hides what needs to be hid, for me the tummy!",1
"I loved this top when i saw it online, and i still love the idea of it. unfortunately, the execution of the design fell short. i'm 5'4 w/ a long lean torso. i ordered my usual small, and the arms on the shirt were so long! b/c of the way the sides of the top cut up and my 34 d chest, i don't think a petite would work for me. such a cute top, but it just won't work for me.",0
"Really cute tee... charcoal is deep and great all seasons. cut high on sides... may need to size up to accommodate - depends on body shape. tried the white, didn't buy--- too lightweight, but could work layered.",1
Love it fits great very comfy goes with all,1
"I'm always searching for a ""dressed up tees"" and these were fabulous! true to size and great quality!",1
The fabric is great quality but it stretches too much around the waist making it look a little awkward. other than that the quality is good.,0
"This shirt is so cute. i ordered a white, but will have to return it for a different color. the white is very sheer/shee through!",1
"These are cool jeans to have in a mound of typical denim jeans i have in my closet and these are like a thorwback of the 60s/70s made with modern, high quality denim. this is my first pair of 7 for all mankind denim, so i can't reference how they fit to their other jeans. however, based on typical pants sizing with other brands at retailer, these pants do run smaller than other brands, especially in the waist area. i ended up buying my size but clearly a diet will be in my near future because they",1
"I love anything orange- when i saw this coat online, i ordered it as i loved all the features. the features of the coat are fun- however the coat came all bunched up in the package. i let it hang for a couple of days but the wrinkles were awful and even steaming and an iron would not take the creases away. i tried the coat on - the buckles were poorly made. i ended up returning this jacket.",0
"I want to love this top - it is so pretty, but i find the fit very odd. i think it runs big, but the arm holes seem to be cut really low. i would love to size down, but then i think the sleeves would be off. unfortunately, i will have to return it.",0
"There was nothing i liked about this coat. it was definitely not designed with a chest in mind. the pins on the straps were already coming off the first time i tried it on. i usually like oranges too, but even this color turned me off.",0
"This super cute skirt has a beautiful drape and overall fit. i was afraid the tie at the front would emphasize my slight tummy, but to the contrary, the skirt is flattering and slimming. at 5'3"", the front of the skirt hits at my upper to mid knee. 118 lbs., 26"" waist, 36"" hips, size 2 regular is a perfect fit.",1
"Super soft, super cute but too short for a dress, too long and too overwhelming for a shirt, and didn't like the look with leggings at all so sadly i'm returning. love the colors, feel and style but no way will sizing up or down fit in a way that was functional...having said that..fits tts i guess.",0
"I wore this for the first time today, and after just about an hour, it gently nicked something and got a hole in the pack.  its so disappointing as i love they style and its so comfortable. very poor quality for the price :(",0
"I wish i had read the reviews before purchasing online. i love how this top looks online but when i tried on the small that i ordered, it was comical. so so boxy. literally, shaped like a square. it must be pinned back on this model. maybe if i ordered an xxxxs it would have worked...or perhaps for a larger person, it may look super cute!
just didn't work on my slim build. :(",0
"This is an absolutely gorgeous sweater. the colors are just as they appear online, but the length stated for the petite version is way off. i suspected as much from the picture, but decided to try it anyway. the petite small went down to my ankles! too bad. i would have loved this sweater if it were an above-the-knee or even at-knee length.",0
"The dress ran big but is tight at the bust, material is sooo sheer and the shape of the dress is off. you can't see the ruffle/ flounce that runs the bottom of the dress.",0
"I love cloth and stone and the softness and prettiness of this fabric did not disappoint. this is not a dress, however. it is a long shirt. the sides were so short the you could see where my bum and hamstrings came together. leggings would ruin the look and as a shirt it would be totally impractical. for reference i am 5'8"" and 130 lbs. the small was the correct size, save for the length.",0
"I tried this on in my usual xs (5'5"", 128lbs) and it fit like a dream. i was instantly in love. until i looked from the side and realized it was cut up way too short. i have a longer torso and shorter legs and this came up past my finger tips if i stood with my arms down. no way could i wear this as a dress. as a tunic definitely though, but i was really hoping to find a nice, versatile fall dress. it was a let down but i still may consider purchasing it because the material was so soft and it f",0
I absolutely love this skirt! i purchased both a medium and a large. i found that it ran big. i typically wear a size 10-12. i ended up keeping the medium and it was perfect!,1
"I love the cold shoulder trend! this sweater is not bulky, but the thick knit will keep you warm while looking stylish! it is not your typical sweater. if you want something unique, but still basic, this is your sweater. looks great with jeans and khakis.",1
"This tunic could be great but there is some weird construction going on at the armhole. first of all, the armhole is way too low! second, there is a totally unnecessary side seam zipper under the arm. since this is a tunic it slips over the head no problem. no need for the side zipper, it adds bulk and distorts the way the fabric should hang at the side.",0
"Loved the design and print of this blouse.  however, every time i put it on or took it off, i could hear the seams ripping.  definitely wasn't because it was too small either.",0
"I don't know how this dress doesn't have more of a following! it's really perfect. i will say, i am tall (5'8"") and lanky. the dress is oversized, but not overly so, drapes beautifully, and will work for any season. fabric is divine. i plan to wear this to work, for travel, on weekends, etc. love the cream/deep charcoal color. at the sale price, this really is a great, versatile find.",1
"Liked everything about this coat but the length! it is beautiful and good quality. first, ordered a medium because the fit seemed slight (i'm a 4-6), returned it for a large. unfortunately, the large will also be returned -- the body length is very cropped, not at all as it appears in photo to meet the top of a waistband. i'll hope to find a similar coat with just a bit more length.",1
The sweater has a substantial weight to it. i ordered xs which is my usual size and i didn't find it ran big at all. the sleeve length and hem length were perfect. very cute with jeans.,1
I sized down to an xs based on reviews and the fit was perfect. i am 34 b and usually take a small. i like the classic lines with the sexy edge. this is a heavier sweater but perfect for our houston fall and winter. if you size down the sweater has a much nicer fit to it and is not at all loose fitting. it just skims your curves.,1
"I am absolutely addicted to tunics. so, when i saw this on sale, with an extra 30% off, i went for it. i'm glad i did! it's absolutely beautiful. i love the opposing stripe patterns, the hi-lo feature (very subtle), and the tie back. so cute!

if you're petite like me, though, you may want to wear something underneath--it does cut a bit low in the chest area.",1
"If you're tall, this dress sits up too high-waisted and this makes your waist look big. it's also kind of thin material on top and stretchy, so even though i'm small chested it made my shoulders and chest look large, but not on a good way. in other words, this dress made me look fat. the length is not bad for taller gals. all in all, not worth it.",0
"Nothing wrong with the dress, sadly it's the body i'm putting it on that's less than perfect. fits fine and tts, but just doesn't do anything for my bit wide hips, other than adds to them. hangs nicely, but jersey top and nylon bottom add to the wide hip issue. that said, i think i may still keep it as its a great length (not too short) and a nice, simple dress. really versatile.",1
"This blouse is great to wear almost anytime! it can easily be dressed up or down depending on the occasion and the accessories. it has a bit more volume around the waist then the picture shows - but that could be because i'm bit more ""well endowed"" than the model. i'm 5'0 and size m/8. this shape looks great on my curves without making me look chunky or stout. the image makes the color look black, but in person the color can pass for a really dark blue in some light. the textile of the fabric is",1
Super cute. was really pleased with my purchase of this sweater. runs just a little big.,1
"The fabric on this top is just so soft. it's a thin cotton knit, and drapes beautifully.

the top runs tts, but.....it is tailored to the body. it's not loose and wide in the width. the length hits the top of the hips just as shown.

this works for casual or dress. for dress, i just put a fancy rhinestone pin over where the knot is. btw, i bought this in black, which is why adding the pin glams it up. although i bought it in black, it's not sheer so a cami isn't needed.",1
"I rarely write a really negative review and retailer is my favorite store ever. but this dress is awful. i ordered the black and white. the fabric is very poor quality. the colors are washed out. i almost didn't try it on, but i did and found that, for me, the fit was terrible (though some of the reviewer pictures are cute).",0
"I love this shirt so much i bought it in another color. it looks like it does in the picture, loose and flowy.",1
"I ordered this to wear for a holiday party hoping to have something unique and dressy. it was too bulky at the shoulders and looked like something a football player would wear. the little ruffled flower pieces were random at the top and stuck out in all the wrong directions. it wasn't as elegant as the model pic (is it ever?) and for this price should fit like a glove. went back within seconds. also, it's pretty short, and bulky short isn't flattering on too many people.",0
"Long-time ag jeans fan. lately though, i'm finding the material is much too stretchy. i wanted a good pair of jeans. if i wanted pajama jeans, i would've ordered them. i found the same thing with the prima jeans i ordered (same review there).
so back both pairs went. 
it's a shame because the color was as pictured and just what i wanted. if only they had been made out of actual jeans material.",0
"I like this top a lot - it's cuter in person than it looks on the model -- it's a little heathered. it definitely fits slimmer one me than on the model, and i'm pretty small on top.

overall, nice to see a reasonably priced basic t on the retailer site",1
"I was walking by my local retailer and saw this in the window and loved the colors. it's a great combination and looks good with white jeans, and regular denim. i like the cuffs on the sleeves and the textured material. it is a kimono - so in essence it is not form fitting. it's meant to flow over whatever else you have on. i purchased the xs/s and i am a normal size 2 and it looks cute. i got lots of compliments when i wore it! there are slits on either side at the bottom hem as well which allow",1
"This shirts dresses up anything-tights, jeans or a skirt. love the color and the length",1
"The shirt is amazing in the photo..but when it arrived in the package to my house, it is sooooo dark that you can't see the patchwork. not happy. going to return it. it was a holiday gift.",0
"Bought this shirt in red in my usual size small. it is so comfortable and easy to wear. i am 5' 8.5"" tall and it fall on me similar to the model in the picture. not sure if i can wear with leggings--may be too short in front. i'm looking forward to layering it under sweaters and sweater vests for a pop of color.",1
"This spandex top, in my opinion, is workout wear. it is not the tank i expected to receive, but my bad. it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts. it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is, it should fit like this. 5' 5"" 142 lbs medium is skin tight. color is nice but, as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisioned-it has to go back to retailer. quality seems fair.",0
"I purchased this top on 2 colors...a great go to....stylish, soft and very comfortable.",1
"This tunic is a great way to wear the plaid trend right now without it being the traditional collared shirt. it's fun, comfortable and has great style. the first time i wore it i got tons of compliments! i'm 5'8"" and the back of the shirt goes to the back of my knees, i usually wear a size 12 and the large fit great!",1
"The fabric felt beautiful, and it felt great on, but once i looked in the mirror it just looked too housedress like. maybe because it runs large. the price seemed high as well. i wanted to love it but i had to return.",0
"I really looked forward to receiving this piece, it was however extremely difficult to get on and off. you have to step into it and it is very narrow. it is difficult to get your arms in and i had to have my husband's help getting it off. i am 5'9"" 135 pounds. i have a fit figure. i ordered a medium, i wear a small or x-small for a top and an 8 in shorts or pants. once it was on i was not thrilled with the extra material around the hips and tummy area. it is not terribly becoming, it bunches up",1
"Simple cotton garment such that the price seems high. if it had fit perfectly there is a chance i would have kept the dress, but my normal size 6 was a bit large and even though it was size petite, also to long in the upper body. perhaps a 4 p would have fit, but it may have then been too small. puzzling for petite to be too long in upper body. love this shape dress and the color and pattern however.",1
I really love this addition to my wardrobe. the colors are great and it is very comfortable. my only complaint is that it runs large. it would be nice if they had more than two sizes.,1
"Pretty blues! colors are exactly as pictured! fits perfectly; not boxy, not tight, just comfortable! i'm 5'9 and this is tunic length on me!",1
"The shirt looks a lot less fitted on the model in the picture than how it fit in ""real"" life. size was not wrong, the material was just very clingy. i was not impressed and subsequently returned it.",0
"I was first attracted to this tunic by the beautiful, bright colors; tried it on, and it was becoming, comfortable, and perfect for my laid-back lifestyle. i just bought it a week ago, have worn it three times already. i bought the blue.",1
"I liked this shirt well enough to order in several colors, preferred it fitting loosely (5'1"" around 100-105 size small). i always look for marine was able and this fit the bill, or so i thought; was so so dismayed to see that after one wash the dye had settled strangely into folds making it look like the shirt had cracks all over it. worse looking on the moss green but still apparent in the black, both no longer wearable.

i am forced to return the shirts but since i do like the shirts i am goi",1
"I have these in many different colors, some with stripes. very versatile and i wear them all year around.holds well through the washing. love these tank top.",1
"I've worn citizens for almost 12 years now, i keep going back because i have an athletic figure (my thighs and butt are bigger than my waist), and usually citizens fit and hug all the right places and are made with a certain quality expectation - these did not meet any of those standards, the ripped as soon as i put them on. the material seemed cheap.",0
"Great material, and i like the idea of a scoop / v neck combination. but the hem rolls up, making it impossible to wear not tucked in to pants or a skirt (and even there it's a little bulky). it's possible that ordering a size up would fix the problem.",0
"Love this top! i'm 5'7, 145 pounds, athletic build, and the medium falls slightly loosely and very nicely over my hips. it is quite low cut, so i wear a tank under it in a professional environment, but it's fine to wear sans tank top in a more casual setting. i really love the back, as the straps are sexy and show off my shoulders. the material seems to be good quality, and i would order this in more colors if it were available!",1
"I saw this dress in the catalog and on-line and it looked so lovely on the models. i took a chance and ordered it in my normal size small. when it arrived i was a little disappointed with the weight of the fabric, it was a bit light in my opinion. it did have an interesting texture, (suede like) so i could overlook the weight of the fabric if the dress fit well. unfortunately it did not, it rather just hung there and was not flattering on me. it looked wonderful on the model but i keep forgettin",0
"Look carefully at the pics of the back. if this style and the color suit you, just go ahead and order this one. it looks just like the pics, and is light, comfortable and true to size. the kind of top you can throw on when you are in a hurry and look great. however, because the back is sheer from halfway down, maybe not for work if you work in an office. moth is one of my favorite brands at retailer and this one is easy-peasy. i am 5'3"", 34c/28/38 and ordered the regular s.",1

"The fabric of this dress feels like suede, i couldn't stop touching it. here comes the ""but"": the dress is cut straight down, no definition. the rosette lace is sewn on, like an afterthought just to make the dress not to look plain or cheap. i tried it on with a belt and by itself, and i still feel like it's just a plain dress that i can get at a discount store. i'm a big fan of tracey reese and own a lot of her dresses, and i feel that this is the most plain dress she ever designed. size s regu",1
"Loved the look of this shirt on the hanger. however when on, i found that it puffed out in the back. it's fitted through the shoulders and mid-back but the bottom rounds out and creates a lower hump. maybe it wouldn't on someone taller? also, although this wasn't a con for me, the shirt is darker than appears online.",0
"It is polyester but seems good quality. looks like a girls nightgown with the pattern combined with the baby doll dress silhouette and the overall width of the dress. i usually wear a small but, to look like it does on the model, 6-8 inches would have to go in the width.",0
"Beautiful neutral color in a comfortable fabric. fits tts. i am 5 ft 2 in and went with the petite. it is a midi on me. i have other skirts from retailer from past years in similar fabric and will say that overtime the waist will stretch even if hand washed carefully. so that being said, buy your size in this skirt, don't go bigger to get a longer length. you can wear it lower on your hips if you like it longer which i think actually looks more flattering. in any case, it's a great piece that no o",1
"This is a beautiful spring/summer dress, and the quality of the materials is great. i wanted to love it. but the sizing is ridiculous! i'm 5'3"" and 115 and i think you could fit three of me comfortably in the xs. while the pictures of the model in the dress don't suggest it has a shapeless cut, it definitely looked like a sack on me. a sack with a lovely print, but still an ill-fitting sack.",0
"Definitely cute and good fit but the distressing at knee is open and will probably get worse, worth it if price lower... maybe",0
"I'm so upset that this didn't work out. i'm petite at 5'2 and ordered this skirt in petite, however, i felt like it swallowed me up. the fabric is thick and warm so this is definitely only cold weather attire. i'm the picture it looks like there is a little leg showing, but on me, i feel like a schoolmarm. sadly, this is going back.",0
"This shirt has much less color variation in person (online it appears vaired, imo). in person it is a darker classic charcoal grey with little to no color variation.

this shirt is very soft, of medium weight, and fits tts. the buttons down the back of the shirt are functional, and the backside pleating ensures you don't show too much skin if you opt to leave one or two unbuttoned.

"Ugh! i am not sure how anyone is giving this good reviews. i tried small, medium and large on and huge huge huge, boxy, fabric bunched at the shoulders and did i mention it's way too boxy? the fabric and pattern are so pretty but the fit is just awful. i would try this one on before purchasing.",0
"I agree with the previous reviewer - the color variation is much more subtle than what is shown online. i would not have bought it had i not seen it ""in real life"". this is a super cute, soft and comfortable shirt. it fits tts and can be worn with jeans, leggings or a skirt. for reference i'm 5""7 and 122 lbs and i took a small but probably could have gone with xs as well but i like the extra room.",1
"I so wanted to like this dress i ordered it for summer graduation and weddings. i usually wear a 4/s and even the xs is was too pig. it drapes like a smock. the material is heavy. the only thing pretty about this dress is the pattern and color.

still looking for the perfect dress...",0
Very happy with my purchase. fit very nice! already received compliments!,1
I was so excited to receive this topped then i tried it on. i am a petite and i normally wear an xs so i ordered it in both a size 0 and a size 2. it was huge! it looked like i was wearing a potato sack!!! i really wanted it to work because the fabric is absolutely beautiful! i am so disappointed.,0
"I wish this fit more to the body, it really does flare out a lot,a adding volume to the person wearing it. the mustard color is beautiful, so is the pink (i ordered both to compare). but the 00 was still big on me (and p). so i passed.
fabric is light for summer, so if you are thin, not muscular, perhaps that would look great?",1
This top is huge! i'm typically a size 2 or 4. i bought the 2 and its huge. it's wider than it is long. even if i sized down to a 0 it would still be too much fabric. i'm so disappointed! beautiful color and fabric but there's so much fabric. i love a flowy top but this one is way too much. :( i will be returning this top.,0
"I bought this because i thought it would flatter my boxy big busted shape and it does. however, while i liked the irregular hemline on the model, on my 5'5 frame it hits at a strange place and so i will hem it a little shorter. the fabric is extremely thin and not lined so this is definitely a light weight summer top even here in the south. i love the modern styling but the quality of the fabric is a concern, definitely no dryer on this one.",1
"Fits well, comfortable and flattering. i wouldn't call this pattern fabric purple though. it is definitely multi colored and purple should not be called the dominate color.. the picture is an accurate representation of the color.",1
"This top is so pretty. i purchased the peach color. it does run large so you will need to size down. you do not need to wear a cami which is nice in the summer. it will look great with jeans, white jeans, shorts, dress it up or down. its not suppose to fit tight... love it!",1
"While i had high hopes for this dress to be my ""go to"", unfortunately o couldn't get passed how cheap the material felt. the cut and pattern both worked on my petite frame, however, the cut out pieces in front are not lines and exposed the top portion of my bra.",0
"Retailer consistently provides unique, sophisticated and quality made clothing. with the exception of an occasional purchase at their sister companies, i shop with them exclusively. i suppose that i can't expect 100% perfection from retailer-but 99% of the time-that's what i get. this is that 1%...this sweater is truly awful! i cannot (or find it very difficult at least) begin to describe what this sweater is like but it is so unlike retailer that, had it not been for the distinct pattern on the front",0
"This top is absolute perfection. i don't think the photo does it justice as it looks so much better untucked. i don't even have great toned arms, but it's still so flattering. i got the gray one amd might get another color. great value, as well! i'm petite - 5'1"" and bought my usual size small.",1
So much extra fabric. not something i would recommend buying online.,0
"I originally bought this from my local retailer in an xs petite. i think it was a return. i brought it home and decided it was just too big for my 5'4"" 116# frame. i ordered it in an xxs petite and am keeping it. the colters are just so pretty and it is machine washable which is an added bonus. it is still flowy but not objectionably so. it is meant to be unstructured and bohemain i think. looking forward to wearing this on my upcoming trip to italy.",1
The top ran too large and it made me look more bustier than i am and rounder in my midsection by how it fell on me. maybe would've been better for someone with a smaller bust. the quality of the fabric was just okay.,0
"What a beautiful, comfortable material and the colors are stunning. i'm so disappointed at the unflattering cut. it fits like a shapeless tent, even the arm holes have big gaps that aren't snug. i am 5'2, 105lbs, and ordered the xxs petite.",0
"I wanted to love this top so badly. between the beautiful photos and the good reviews, i didn't think i could go wrong with it. unfortunately, it just didn't look great on. the bust area sagged on my smaller chest, and then the top flared way out from the waist down. it doesn't lay even remotely flat like the photos would have you believe. maybe this would look better on hourglass or slim types. the quality does appear to be good -- the material is weighty and soft.",0
"After reading the reviews i sized down to a 6. once i received it, i loved the fabric and color, however it was so ill-fitting. it's like the designer didn't even use female measurements and used a box to make this top--too wide. i liked it so much that i sized way down to a 0 and it still fit horribly. it is too wide and not long enough. both are going back!",0
"Beautiful fabric, but the fit was off. the picture makes the dress appear fitted than it actually is. the belt is definitely needed, but would leave a lot of fabric in the back of the dress giving it a less than tailored look. 

also, the arms and the top portion are a tad small, so if you have a larger bust/arms, this dress may be tricky. i am a 34b and the button in the xxsp was puckering a bit.i was really looking forward to this one for fall, but was no way for me to make it work.",0
"Whatever happened to sizing! pretty print and color but has enough fabric for 2 tops. it is also unlined which is not a huge issue. i wore it with a cami. the arms weren't too gaping for me, thankfully. i tried to make it work with a wide belt but i will have to get it tucked on the sides. i am 140 lbs and got the small. should have gone 1 or even 2 sizes smaller.",0
"This dress is absolutely lovely. i couldn't leave the store without it, even though it was full price and i have a million dresses. it's just that great. i am 5' 8"" 130 lbs and bought the small",0
"Was very disappointed with this dress. it's very baggy, no shape. felt like an oversized sack. purchased in med. bust area was only semi good fit all else flopped :(",0
"This blouse is romantic and timeless. the tonal print is lovely, the peplum cut flattering. i followed the advice of other reviewers and ordered one size up, which fits perfectly. it has a hidden side zip to make for easier off and on. i love the mix of cotton and silk which makes it breathable and lightweight. thank you, retailer, for finally making a blouse with natural fabrics that do not need a cami underneath! perfect for warm climates.",1
"I bought this t-shirt in pink, blue, red, grey and black over the past year. every one of them except the grey, has gotten little pin holes in the front of the shirt below your waistline. i've returned them all. the fabric is thin and the quality of the t/shirt is terrible.",0
"This is a gorgeous blouse, but it runs small in my opinion. i consistently wear a size 2 in moulinette soeurs, and i'm trying to decide if a 4 will still be too small, and if i need to exchange for a 6. construction and materials are lovely, just consider sizing up if you purchase this blouse.",1
"Beautiful top but runs very small. based on some of the reviews that i read i ordered two sizes up from my usual size and it is still a little tight in the chest and around the ribs. i would like to exchange for the next size up but it is sold out in that size. considering how small this blouse runs it would have been nice if retailer had ordered some extra tops in larger sizes as i am sure that many people will have to size up. regardless, i love the blouse and would definitely recommend it to an",1
This top is adorable! runs a bit small but so cute worth the price and tons of compliments!!!!,1
Light and airy. runs really small. had to go up 2 sizes. a little pricy but overall a cute blouse. not your typical blouse.,1
"I just purchased this cute top at my local retailer store and definetely the size is way off! in blouses i wear a size 6 (small or medium) with a 34b bust, tall and slender and i had to purchase a size 12 (what????).

overall so cute and could not pass it up. good luck. try it on before purchasing.",1
This jacket is really cute. i tried in in a large in the store and was too big so i took a chance and ordered medium on line. i have broad shoulders so i was a bit worried. it's perfect. very fitted and cropped. but will look great to throw on over a dress. for reference i'm 5 foot 6 inches and a 34 c. 132lbs. slender but athletic. medium was perfect.,1
Great romper i personally would not wear it for ever day - i will be wearing it for a beach cover up while on vacation. for reference i ordered a m and am 130 34b.,1
"Very feminine and romantic blouse, i love it. it runs small as other reviewer said. i had to go 3 size up, as i want to wear a cami under it. the fabric is soft and sheer. the design emphasizes the nature curve of a woman's body, in a good way. back is longer than the front part. if you like romantic, floral prints and soft fabric, this one is a winner,",1
"I had really high hopes for this shirt after reading the reviews. first off it runs really small. i usually wear a small or medium ( 4 or 6) i couldn't even get the 6 on. i probably could have even done a 10. the fabric was extremely flimsy. i was almost afraid i was going to rip it taking it off. other than the sizing and the fabric, it just wasn't flattering on me.",0
"The fabric is beautiful, a bit sheer, but overall lovely. however, the sizing is really off.
fyi: 36c, broad shoulders/back - my usual size in a fitted top (this one is very fitted in the waist and bust) is a 12. i tried the 12 and 14, and the side zipper wouldn't come near closing. it is very, very nipped right under the bust.
so, if you have no bustline and a super small waist, this top is for you. if you are like me, high waist and straight up and down, this is a pass. in fact, it is really h",1
"Loved this online, but the xs was too big and the material was too bulky.",0
"I bought the black leggings and love how warm and comfy they are. i wore them with a tunic and boots to work, and people were surprised that they were leggings. the ribbing makes them nicer than plain black leggings. i want another pair, especially for the price!",1
"This dress is just so beautiful. i purchased the teal with beading at the hem. the beading is subtle and beautiful. i'm wearing this do a spring wedding, even though i believe it would be best in cooler months. i so wanted the plum option with the flower aplique at the hem - wouldn't that be perfect for the spring wedding - but all gone!
note - the teal with the beading - the beading weighs a bit, enhancing the lines of the dress - doesn't stick out, doesn't make you look like your wearing a dr",1
"36dd, 10/12 in tops, 12/14 in bottoms, bought size m/l
very cute pattern on the grey leggings, and the fleece lining is warm. they are thick too, so even stretched they are not see through. i would say 14 would be as large as these bottoms would fit as they are snug, but fine for wearing under skirts and dresses.",1
Does not say ribbed. did not want ribbed. would not have bought ribbed,0
"Love this top..got it in both orange and white and always get compliments, especially on the orange color - beautiful and vibrant color! very comfy top and washes well with no problems. the style does swing but not too huge.",1
"$20 for super comfy, warm leggings. bought two pairs for myself and another pair for my mother. let's be honest, i'll probably be buying another pair.",1
"I love these jeans, but they run small. i recommend ordering one size up.",1
I bought this to wear to and english garden themed party and i loved it for this event. it is very bright maybe even more than the pictures if that's possible and the skirt is was long on my 5'4 frame so i had to get it it hemmed several inches so that it didn't give the 50's housewife look. it was comfortable and i the skirt had just enough poof to make me feel great. i could wear a regular bra but not sure where else i'm going to wear this but i'm going to try to come find another event worthy,1
"These leggings are amazing. by far one of the most comfortable pairs that i own! i should have ordered more. i got a m/l and they fit perfect. the detailing is awesome, and they even stay opaque when you sit, so you don't have to worry about them being see-through. great buy!",1
I loved the look of these jeans-super cute-however they were way too tight! i ordered my usual size 31. they don't fit like a darker pair of serif jeans i own. back they go ! i'd be curious if anyone else found these to run smaller.,1
"I love this skirt! i wasn't sure about the mix of the back pattern with the front but it works! it is great for work at a less conservative place and for dinners out too! the quality is great - the skirt is a fine silk, ant it is lined, so you don't need a slip. i think it fits perfectly for my body type, and while it runs big compared to typical retailer sizing, it is true to size compared to other stores in the petite sizes anyway. i am normally a 0 petite, 5'2"", 104, waist 24.5"", hips 34",1
"This skirt looks and feels cheap, and the color is much more green than pictured. additionally, i comfortably wore a size 4 and then lost a few pounds, and this is still way too tight to be flattering.",0
Super itchy! had to return.,0
"I was expecting these to be the normal thickness of everyday leggings, plus fleece. instead, they're more like thicker-than-average tights. still warm, though there's a weird seam on the inside of the thighs that takes away from some of the comfort. not so bad that i want to return them, but not what i was hoping for, either.",1
"The material, deep color and design are gorgeous. however, the dress is just too bulky for my 5'2"" and 110lb frame. i ordered a 0p, and it just wasn't flattering on me. it's somewhat tent-shaped so the fact that it's not at all fitted and has a thick lining made me look larger than i actually am. i'm so disappointed because the dress really is beautiful otherwise.",0
"I really wanted to love this shirt. it looked so nice and cool for summer and i don't own anything purple. the color was really nice, very subtly feminine. i am a little too short for this style though. i am 5 ft. 1 inch, 105 lbs ordered an xxs and it was still too wide. the side slits came up a little too high for my liking, but i easily could've stitched those up a bit and they'd have been fine. i think this would look great on taller women, but on me it looked like a dumpy sack.",0
"This is a beautiful skirt, but runs very small. i usually wear a size 8 and could not get the side zipper closed....at all.",0
I usually wear a 6 and ordered two other skirts at the same time. the other skirts fit perfectly and this one was more like a size 2. very disappointed for i really liked the idea of it.,0
"Really comfortable, great for casual event or everyday wearing. best style with jeans.",1
"I had high hopes for this top, as it looked great online. unfortunately it was much more ruffly in person and not my style at all. it was a lot of fabric and poofed out too much -- reminded me of a child's top. sad to return it!",0
"I'm a size 28 jeans 5'9 with a bubble bottom. these were falling off of me around the hips. these are warm. i was expecting them to not be sheer since they are fleece lined but when i sat down i was shocked to notice it. it doesn't matter functionality wise because i never felt a ""draft."" they look good and are well made but i will be returning due to the lack of fit.",0
"Truly the only word that comes to mind when i think of this dress is dazzling! the pictures online just barely do it justice...if you have an retailer nearby, check to see if its available in store and go check it out in person. it does not disappoint! every year around this time, our beloved retailer seems to come out with this style of dress. in the years past they have all been different and beautiful, but i think they have truly outdone themselves this year. this dress is a deep emerald green...",1
Really comfortable leggings! not see through and at a great price!,1
"Maybe it's just me, but this skirt had a little more volume than i was expecting. i'm 5'7, around 125lbs and the small fit me well. i like that the waist is elastic in back providing some give, but allowing the front to look smooth. pockets are always great. i got a striped henley from retailer (which is awesome) to tuck into it & was excited for the 70s vibe.
the problem is that it fell an inch or two longer on me than the model, and i already worry about midi skirts appearing frumpy without the",0
"I stumbled upon this item at my local retailer, and immediately had to true it on. the colors are so lovely in person. after trying it on, i was disappointed :( the material has a foamy/air feel to it, and the skirt seems to run small. needless to say, i didn't purchase this item.",0
Liked everything about these but they should say in the description that they're ribbed.,1
"Just got this top in the mail today, and i love it. i bought the white in a small, and it fits as pictured on the model. the fabric says it's cotton, but it's a substantial fabric and feels as soft as silk. the bodice is lined, so no bra lines show through. the tiered part of the tank is not lined but is not really sheer or see-through. the arm holes are not too large, as sometimes happens on me when i wear sleeveless tops. i think i'll be wearing this one a lot this summer, and a lot of summers",1
"This top is beautiful in design, but sadly, i will be returning. it is hand wash, and even after doing so, i had 2 unraveled threads resulting in large holes. unfortunate since it was so flattering before washing.",0
"So soft, comfortable and warm! i ordered the black and think i'll buy the grey and lavender, as well. the material is a little synthetic/almost shiny looking, but definitely not a deal breaker. these are my new lounge pants. recommend!",1
I bought the black and gray fleece lined leggings. i thought the price was great. too good to be true. you get what you pay for. once i opened the box they smelled awful. it was a chemical smell. i washed the black pair twice and it was a little better. i have washed the gray 5 times and it still smells.,0
"I'm 140 at 5' 8"". pear shape. the pockets really opened up when i put them on and didn't lay flat. loose on leg opening - which i liked. but the pockets sticking out around the hip area made my pear shape even wider. i got a medium",0
I get so many compliments when i wear this... colors are great and print is unique. perfect for fall.,1
"This dress is absolutely gorgeous. every time i wear it, people just don't stop admiring it. great material and great fit.",1
I couldn't even figure out how to wear this sweater the fit was so odd. the arms cut off short and the seams don't hit your shoulders where they should. all the extra fabric around the collar is just confusing and unflattering. moving around in it was not easy. i will return this one!,0
"I loved this top but it runs small so i had to send it back, unfortunately.
beautiful styling and color blocking. just wish there had been a larger size available to have been able to exchange for.",1
"Love tiny. i am 5'7"", 125-128 lbs depending on the day, and a 34a. i also have a very long torso, and tiny shirts are one of the few brands that are usually long enough for me. this one, however, was a huge miss. i ordered online in my usual tiny xs. it was much too big around and felt shorter in the front than stated, so it looked boxy on me. however, the worst part was the placket. the description doesn't note that it's held together with a tiny snap. that snap takes nothing to undo, and then",0
Was so excited to see that this colorful top came in petite sizes! it fits perfectly and so happy that it doesn't fall too long. looks great with a longer cardigan sweater. very happy with this find .,1
Loved the look of the sweater and the the fit was as shown.  however this is a thin cashmere for the price.  returned.,0
"I love this tank. super soft and comfy. i wear with leggings, jeans, shorts- anything. longer in the back so will cover your butt- at least it covered mine. runs slightly oversized. love the asymmetry in the front- very flattering. very happy with it.",1
"Online this dress looks so perfect, but in person it's a bit dowdy and unflattering, at least on me. i'm a size 4 with curves, and i was hoping it would enhance my waist and flatter my figure. but, sadly, it was too large on the waist and too poofy in the skirt, so it just did nothing for me. i considered sizing down to a 2 so that the waist would fit, but the skirt still has too much fabric, making my hips look large. so much potential, but missed the mark for me.",1
"It looks adorable in the picture... but just not flattering in real life. too much fabric in the skirt that flares from the waist in a bunchy, unflattering way. makes a slender but curvy figure look boxy, rather than enhancing curves. it's a pass. love the blue print, though.",0
"I have had this shirt for a little over a month. i've wore it maybe 3-5 times and there is a small hole in the middle of the sleeve on my shoulder. it's not even on a seam, so i can't fix it. i expect much better quality from retailer. don't buy this. the quality is very disappointing. which is really unfortunate because this is a very nice fitting shirt and goes well with pencil skirts.",0
"Some quick notes- it is not sheer, like a previous poster was asking. there is a lining. the color is darker than it appears online, which was ok with me. i thought it still looked nice as a deeper gold. i was excited about this top, and thought it was the perfect thing for a casual/festive company holiday party. i ordered a m, and am usually between m and s in most retailer items. unfortunately it fit me rather boxy and short. i have a larger bust (30g) and it draped in a very unflattering way. m",1
"I ordered this turtleneck in white and was very surprised to find that the material is so thin and gauzy it's sheer. i will definitely have to wear a white camisole under this every time i wear it, even when using it as a layering piece. it seems to run true to size if not a little small. the neck is interesting because it is so light and floppy...you can adjust several ways. it doesn't hold form well, though. i will most likely keep it but will never wear it without something both under and ove",0
"Oh boy...i didn't get this one, and it runs small. too bad.",0
The dress has an awesome fit and the perfect length. it's easy to make it more classy with a summer cardigan.,1
"I didn't notice what some of the other reviews have said. i think it's very flattering, makes my waist look tiny and the flouncy skirt is a lot of fun. it is low cut in the bust, but not crazy. i'm a modest person and i'm comfortable with it. what i like best however it the cut of the top. it is wide enough at the arms to cover any armpit bulge! the fabric is very light and soft and the colors are vibrant and fun. it does run a tad large. i can go between a 2 and 4 in most retailer dresses and got",1
"Love this dress! sadly, it ran so large that it was literally falling off of me. because i bought it on sale, the option wasn't there to buy a smaller one. the quality is excellent and it's perfect for a spring or summer day in miami:-) sorry to have had to return it due to the sizing issue.",1
"Everyone else who reviewed felt the dress fit quite odd.  i have an oddly shaped body, so this dress was perfect on me!  the bigger bodice fit on my large broad rounded upper body, skimmed my true waist and flared out to complimentary skirt that wasn't too twee.  the silhouette evens out my odd figure.  the fabric is a gorgeous pink/orange/teal pattern on comfortable cotton.  i do have to agree with the lowness of the neckline, it's a bit immodest.  i wear my cropped denim jacket and a simple la",1
"I took a risk on this dress despite the multiple reviews about the pouffy skirt and revealing neckline, because i loved the look of the blue motif print. alas, the adorable print, the handy bra-strap holders, and super-soft fabric were the only things that worked for me. i'm 5'3"" and 120 lb, small up top, not especially curvy but not straight either, and i ordered my usual 2p. yup, the pleated skirt was much too full (i felt as though i was wearing a cheerleader's skirt) and the neckline was way",0
The color of these shorts is even more beautiful and vibrant in real life. the detail is wonderful and they are so comfortable!,1
"It is indeed cut to the shape of a trench. however, i think retailer should rename it as it's more like wearing a cardigan. it's soft and pretty which i like. however, i wasn't convinced to buy it since i have a gazillion long black cardigans already made out of the same jersey stretch material.",0
I saw this initially in the store and thought it was nice but did not purchase because i thought the price was too high.  i saw it again and it was on sale but the store had sold out of my size.  i checked online and my size was available so i ordered.  i was afraid this cape would be to long and make me look frumpy but it wasn't and i didn't.  it looked great. i tie the belt a little higher than the model to make me look taller.   i can't wait to wear it on cool fall days.,1
"I love the colors and style of this poncho, however, the fabric is a total miss.  it is so scratchy, i developed a serious rash within the first 1/2 hour of wering it. also, unfortunately, the fabric is not woven tightly, so the poncho does not keep you warm, the wind whips right through it. it is disappointing that while the styles of retailer have remained top, the quality of their clothing has steadly gone down the hill. i hope retailer will put more effort in bringing the quality back.",0
"This blouse is stunning on the website ;however, it is totally sheer which you cannot tell from the photo. i was very disappointed and will be returning.",0
Very comfortable and love the color. i'm a bit curvier on the bottom and the small still fit me fine.,1
"This was very tight in the bust in my typical size. it fit more or less everywhere else, but the material has no give. so unless you are the precise measurements of the dress, this will be a hard dress to wear.
the color is really lovely though!",0
"Love these! i am a medium in shorts or 29-30, and the medium fit perfectly.. true to size, very soft, flattering cut and color. love the embroidery. great for travel, very light and can be jazzed up a little with nice sandals, almost like a flirty little short skirt. the fullness and non fitted look is great for a less than perfect tummy.
i am very happy with this purchase.",1
"I loved this dress when i saw it online, perfect for a summer wedding, but when i tried it on i was very disappointed. the fabric and styling are gorgeous and very high quality but the sheer amount of fabric on this dress is just not as pictured. there is layer after layer of silk and ruffle and while lovely, it made me look very large. i tried tying the belt many ways to no avail. sadly, it will have to go back. it may look good on a very thin frame but didn't complement my average one.",0
"First off, this shirt is a hd in paris brand, not floreat. i love floreat clothing so that is why i initially bought this blouse. i like the idea and the coloring of the shirt. the biggest drawback for me was that it is completely see through. i just bring myself to get a strapless cami just to wear this one top. please change brand name.",0
"I had such high hopes for this blouse, as it looks totally stunning online. however, it's not as pictured/described in that it is totally sheer and the brand is not floreat, but rather hd in paris. for the price, the quality is just not there...i've seen comparable shirts at other stores for much less. i returned it without a second thought.",0
I tried it in the store but was not the true size so i ordered online. i wore it only once so far and got lots of compliments. very unique design.,1
Simple pull-on pant with a great design. they look flattering on and can easily be dressed up. i wear between a 4 and 6 and the small fit perfect. i have washed them and worn them several times and they still seem good as new. the wide elastic waistband ensures that they stay in place.,1
I was hesitant to buy this due to the price but so i glad i did when it came in the mail. great quality and surprisingly thick silky fabric. very comfortable and the shimmery thread detail is beautiful. could be very warm in the summer due to the thick tweed like fabric. fits and looks true to size just like it does on the model.,1
Cute top; somewhat sheer but color and fit are great. fits slim but true to size.,1
"These pants are wonderful. they are very flattering, the color is gorgeous, and they are incredibly comfortable. got tons of complements!",1
I got fooled by this dress's description. it's 100% polyester and not wool as it claims to be! looks cheap.returned it!,0
This top is perfectly feminine. the fabric is light and the bow adds that perfect touch of distinction.,1
"I wanted to love this dress, and i don't. it is soft, it is flattering on the model, and sits comfortably on the shoulders... until you move. the heaviness of the shoulders pulls the fabric back, causing the drape along the bottom to look odd, and unflattering. so sad- i wore it to lunch with my husband, but felt like i was constantly pulling the shoulders/sleeves back into place... i won't pull it from my closet to wear again, very often.",0
"I really try to avoid hand washing so i immediately checked the label when i found this dress in-store. and despite the fact that retailer lists this as hand wash online, the label says machine wash. (it also says lay flat to dry.) so i was happy about that. i tried this in xs regular (first photo with camisole) which was too low-cut and then ordered the xspetite in the second photo (i'm a 34aa, ~105 lbs.) which was better; higher v-neck mainly and shorter length, although i could've gone with eit",1
"The dress is beautiful! it is very long, romantic, and feminine. i am 5'10"" and it touches the ground. i tried on an xl, (normally i am a l and today i wore a size m retailer dress to work) and i could not even begin to zip the xl dress. the arms were fine. i think i would need 2-3 sizes higher. i am so sad because it is so beautiful.",1
These are so comfortable! i love how they fit snug but have tons of stretch..this is my second pair of fleetwood from coh. love this style,1
"Very cute skort that fits tts. great length for us middle aged women as well! love the hidden front pockets and the modern color block design. my only issue is the side zipper gets stuck right where the waistband starts. i'm assuming this is because of the thicker fabric around the waistband. i usually try to wait for the sale prices, but i think this skort will sell out well before then.",1
"I'm 5'2-5'3 which is supposed to be the max height for pieties in retailer (former employee) and while the bodice hit right, the skirt was insanely long. not even with heels is this gonna be right. and no discount towards hemming? i'll wait until this hits the sale rack, which it will because concensus is, it's way too long.",0
"Gorgeous, but the trim detail on both in-store coats was already trashed and falling apart. for $218 and it can't even make it out of the store intact? i love the look but didn't want it to fall apart. they should've done an extra reinforcing stitch on the trim. such a shame!!",0
I love this tee so much i bought in every color available. i have received so many compliments on each one! so soft and comfortable and easy care.,1
It's the inverted invert ... not so obvious at first but then it shrunk and was harder to ingnore.,0
"I ordered this dress for my engagement photos and i am so excited to wear it! it's a gorgeous dress, a bit fancy. it drapes so nicely on the body. as previous reviews have stated, it's a little snug in the chest and shoulders so you might want to size up. i typically wear a size 4 in dresses and fairly small chested, and i decided to stick with the small in this dress. i probably would have been a little more comfortable in a medium as it's a little tight in the shoulder area still. overall thou",1
"Love this dress so so much! the wearability of it isn't much since it's such a ""wow!"" dress, but if you have a wedding that it would be fitting for, itso perfect. if it were a touch shorter i'd be happy wearing it to the park. i'd suggest hemming if you want to make it more casual buy why go there when it's so stunning long. the sales associates in store kept telling me i looked like a princess ( although that may have been my doing as i kept twirling for them saying "" look how cool this is!"") .",1
Wore these to church and stayed cool without being scandy. i havent worn skorts since the 90s and this was such a nice return to that trend. :-),1
"I have discovered that i'm really picky about t-shirts. it's hard to find a cute, flattering one that you can wear with whatever. this one is perfect. the neckline is different, the sleeves are short -- almost cap sleeves. it fits nicely everywhere. i am an 8/10 and the medium fit well. i love that it's a dark enough color and not sheer (why are so many of your clothes see through, retailer?!!!) , so i don't have to layer something under it just to wear it. it's thin enough that you can wear it in",1
"I love this dress. it is so flattering and comfortable! i am petite with curves, and feel so good when wearing this. i ordered a petite small. i will have to stop myself from wearing it every day this summer.",1
"Nice t-shirt. the print is very nice and the fabric is soft and flowing. i love the baseball cut, it gives it a different look.",1
"Thought this would be great for a laid-back wedding in new mexico, but didn't fit. i am a 12-14 and the 14 barely fit my chest and arms. not flattering. material did not seem very breakthable. had to return. better luck next time.",0
The skirt part of the dress falls straight and accentuated my stomach. you can't really tell from the pic. but if you have even the slightest bump of a stomach the dress might make it look worse instead of better because of the way that it is cut. i'm pretty slim - 5'5'' and 114 pounds and it wasn't doing me any favors! the top of the dress is beautiful! i will exchange it for something else. i ordered it online and couldn't try it on before purchasing it.,0
"This dress is adorable. it's very comfortable and so flattering. the only thing is i can't understand why it is priced so high. it's a great dress, but i'm just not convinced it's the worth the price tag. i'm going to watch for it to go on sale. fingers crossed!",1
"Looks lovely in the picture but looks poorly made in person, runs very small. i returned it.",0
"I absolutely adore this set. it's beautifully constructed-- perfect for something special but comfortable enough for everyday wear. i normally wear a 32 c but got the 34 a/b and it fits perfectly. my only complaint is that the longline portion tends to ride up and rest just below the underwire, as there is no band holding the lace in place along the bottom. still, it is far and away my favourite bra and i highly recommend it.",1
"A truly gorgeous dress. ran a little too small in the shoulders for me so i had to reorder the next size up. its is very long, but i won't hesitate to have it altered. it is stunning!",1
"Love  this dress, beautiful!",1
"I love this dress, saw it online and went to try it on in the store the next day. this dress is perfect! the pattern stands out but isn't too overwhelming. i'm 5'4"" 120lbs and 32ddd i bought an xs and i love the fit. it's just the right amount of fabric to be flowy without being excessive. one thing i've found with flowy dresses is they make you look preggers if you have a large bust however this dress is nothing of the sort. seriously if you find your size in stock snatch it up!",1
"I fell in love with this dress as soon as i saw it. it does fit more loosely than i typically prefer, but the colors and the patterns have such personality that it didn't matter. i wear mine both as a dress and with leggings for the windy days. this is one of my new favorites!",1
"I was excited to get this romper, but it just didn't work. i'm petite with a large bust and the blousy design of the top portion just hung like a bag on me. returned.",0
"After washing this top pilled terribly. it is beautiful, but only for one use.",0
"I ordered the orange color online and was very happy with the product when it arrived. it's a soft orange color, perfect for fall. the shirt is thin and probably will need a cami underneath, but it's longer in the back than the front and will go great with leggings or skinny jeans.",1
I am so sad that this romper didn't work out. it's just way too billowy and huge. i am usually between a small and medium so i ordered this small. i'm petite and somewhat curvy and i was absolutely swimming in this romper! might look best on taller girls. i am 5 '2 and about 125-130 lbs and this was like wearing a tent. do not recommend. such a bummer because i was a believer after treading all of the great reviews!,0
"The picture does not do this swing sweater any justice. first of all, the colors are much more vibrant in person than in the picture. the description says it is a ""yellow motif""; there is absolutely no yellow in it. a bit of khaki in two rows of plaid, but no yellow. the predominant colors are a rich maroon, which is so popular this season, some bright blue and salmon colors, which does not come out in the picture. rich and beautiful.

secondly, the sweater is sassy on -- just plain fun. i am",1
"I followed the other reviews and sized down. normally, i'm a small/medium in retailer (5'8""/135 for clarification) and i expected the garment to be a bit roomy. i ordered the small and when it arrived i almost called the corporate office to ensure i didn't have to pay rent on the romper, given that you could comfortably fit a small family of five in it. oddly, the arm-holes were normal sized? i returned this mess.",0
This is an adorable dress that just didn't work for me! so sad! i wanted to love it because the pattern is super cute. i gave it 4 stars because it is very pretty and i can see it working on others!,0
"On shopping trips i try to try on at least one thing that i like but don't think will look that great on me. this dress was that item today. not only did i like it, but i liked the way it looked on me. i'm 5'3"", 140 pounds and purchased the medium. i loved it, the clerks loved it, and my very honest daughter also loved it. i will wear it as a dress and also as a tunic over skinny jeans.",1
"I am 5'9, very long waisted, generally a size 10-12 or med, but ordered the large to ensure it would not ride up.
(and this brand has run small in the past)
i am keeping the large but also ordering a med to compare as i have room to spare - length and width
either way, this is a keeper!!
it is adorable on, comfortable, my t-back bra works perfectly, very flattering, and way better than expected
the shorts length is a little longer than pictured, but there is an elastic waist with a cami under an",1
"Noticed this sweater as soon as i walked in the store. i am 5'5"" 135lbs, with an athletic build so teeter between a small and medium in tops. i spent a long time trying to decide if i preferred the small or medium fit. the sweater is a bit boxy so ended up sizing up, as the longer length seems to off set some of the boxiness. i am looking forward to wearing this with skinny jeans and boots. as another reviewer suggested, i think a denim shirt will look great underneath. rated a good in quality b",1
This dress was very boxy and unflattering. i really wanted to like it because the blue and white details were so pretty but it had to go back.,0
"Fell in love with this romper online, but since a few reviewers mentioned it ran large, i wanted to try it on in the store. this romper is even better in person! extremely flattering, delicate details and lined! it's adorable! i am glad i tried it on in the store. i am usually a size 6/medium, but the small worked better for me. i know this will be a staple of mine all spring and summer.",1
This shirt is very flattering and drapes beautifully. i am 5'7 175 and the medium fits perfectly. i bought in navy but am disappointed in the other options - i would have bought all of them had they been nice colors but the yellow and orange are really garish and unflattering on any skin tone and the white way too see-through which ruins the visual lines of the top. bummer! but i wear the navy every day so give that a thumbs-up.,1
This dress did not work for me. it was shapeless and boxy. i tried to belt it but the white front looked odd. if you are tall and thin maybe but not for the short girls.,0
"Sometimes ""swing"" styles don't work on me - i'm on the busty side so they often make me look like i'm wearing a tent from a side view. not so this sweater. it's more of an a-line shape than a ""swing"" style and is very flattering - i would think on all body types. i love that it zips up and has pockets. the plaid is really pretty and the overstitching detail and ribbbed bottom elevate the styling. super soft too - not an itch in sight!! 
(don't know why they call this coloration ""yellow"". it's n",1
"I threw this into my cart online on a whim, but i'm not disappointed! and i don't even wear rompers usually. for reference, i'm 5'2 and normally a size 2, and i bought this romper in a size xs petite. if you're on the shorter side, i definitely recommend buying it in the petite size, as i feel that this romper would run large in the regular sizes. the fabric of the top drapes nicely on me, and the shorts are about medium length. i like the neckline details. the armholes in the petite size aren't",1
This is a pretty tunic but it just didn't look right on me. the colors are nice and you can easily hide body flaws.,1
"A fun dress to just throw on go, nice details in the bodice, mix of blues in the prints, little longer in back is nice detail for those of us who want a shorter dress but not the worry of flashing from behind",1
"Cute design, the fabric drapes well, conceals many possible figure flaws, and has an upbeat, easy vibe. i got a small and am 125 lbs and 5'4"". i also washed it on a short cycle on cold and put it in the dryer for 5 minutes, which worked out just fine. great dress!",1
"I agree with the other review. the fabric and pattern are adorable and well made. the fabric is not sheer at all and great quality;however, the shirt is very wide. i am a 34/26/36 and the small is way too big. the arm holes are perfect but the bottom is uncomfortably large and awkward in appearance.",0
"Love everything about this: the length, cut, look, etc. i wear medium/large... went with medium and it was perfect.",1
"Purchased this dress at the sale price, with an additional 20% off sale, not exactly sure what to expect-- the print is so different than my usual style preference. so glad i did! while the dress is way oversized (for reference, i'm 5'4, 132 lbs) ordered size sm but prob should have gone with xs) it's stylish, yet effortless. today is the first day of wear (at my office) and already received many complements.",1
Did not notice small hole and stain on the bottoms until i had the tags removed the return label shredded.,0
"This shirt is incredibly comfortable. the material is so soft, and it fits so well. i am 5'6"" and 130 lbs with a 32b chest and i purchased a small - it is large on me, and i would have preferred an xs, but the small is just fine as well! it is a great shirt, especially for an oversized henley. 100% recommend. (one star off for the larger sizing.)",1
"I liked the product shots of this cardigan, but when i opened it up out of the package i was kind of ...unimpressed... the green wasn't quite the color i was expecting, the fabric was rougher, the lace was scratchy, the fit was boxy, and the sleeves are very dolman... none of which translated through the pictures online... i still think it's cute, but it has a much more casual look to it than i was expecting. i might reconsider if it hits sale, but for now it goes back...",0
"I had high hopes for these as coh is my favorite brand of denim, and these crops were made specifically for petites. also, i was happy to see they were described as a straight jean, not a skinny. the fit and sizing seems to be a little off. i ordered my regular size in this brand, 27p, but they were too big. sized down to a 26p. they were still too large in the waist (seemed very stretchy) but fit well in the legs. i like the fact that these crops were made for petites so the length was perfect,",1
I agree that this shirt is boxy and has no shape; it doesn't look at all like it does on the model. i returned it.,0
"I'm 5'3 135lbs with hour-glassy figure and the medium was a too tight from the waste down (but perfect on the top - i'm a 36c). pretty dress overall and looks true to color in photo, but have to return.",1
This is a great winter addition to any wardrobe. warm but not hot. looks great with tights as a dress or with leggings. so many compliments.,1
"In accordance with other reviewers, the pictures don't do this gorgeous lightweight sweater justice; the fabric has threads of gold, silver, and black that together make for shimmery elegance--not at all the heather grey in the photo.. i'm 5' 8"" 120 34b and the xs (regular) fits perfect--and actually more slimming/fit than in the photo. sleeves are long--which i love. a keeper, especially on sale!",1
"I tried this on in store yesterday and didn't buy it due to the dolman style sleeves and the scratchy lace.  dolman sleeves look terrible on me, so this was a no go.  beware the scratchy lace...i had this on for about 2 minutes and was itching.  otherwise, this will wok for plenty of people - the color can be a nice neutral.  it does run large - i usually wear a large and sized down to a medium.  it didn't work for me, but i'm sure some will find it a nice part of their wardrobe.",0
I couldn't tell on line this top has gold metallic thread running throughout. i find metallic thread to be itchy. when i first put it on i thought it might be o.k. i can tolerate a fair amount of itch in fabric. after about 5 minutes i suddently couldn't wait to get it off. seemed like the longer it was next to my skin the more irritating it became. it is also a bit thinner fabric than i expected. i was hoping to use it as a layering piece. it would work well for layering if it was comfortable.,0
"I was excited to see this top on sale as i had been watching it for a few weeks. unfortunately, i was very disappointed when i received it. it is, as a previous person said, very much like a pajama top. it is very loose and boxy, and in my opinion, did not flatter my shape at all. sadly, i will be returning it. i would not recommend this top to a person who is athletic, or straight and slender, as you suggest.",0
"This top is has an awkward neckline, doesn't lay like the photo (as mentioned by another reviewer.) see threw, and of poor quality. the fit is very baggy and unflattering. and material is very thin. it also runs very large!! the color is pretty, but that is it :(",0
"Hi, when i received this top i tried it on, looked in the mirror and packed it up for a return. the quality is excellent but it just too boxy. fits nothing like it appears on the model.",0
"I really wanted to love this but the cut was very wide, short, and crooked. after it was washed once, it was completely unwearable because it hung all wrong.",0
"I wanted to love this shirt, but was very disappointed. i had read other reviews and still ordered, but wish i would have listened. the shirt looks nothing like photos online and is extremely boxy and unflattering. had to send it back.",0
"The color is perfect for fall.  dressy enough for work, and looks great with a pair of jeans.",1
"When i saw this online i immediately put it on my ""must buy"" list. i hate paying the exorbitant shipping fees retailer charges so i was waiting until i could get to my local store, in the meantime it looks like it has sold out online but i am sure it will be back in stock soon. luckily, my b&m store had it and i am so glad i didn't waste my money or time ordering it online. this could have been great but once again antho missed the mark. what the product shot online doesn't show is that it has dol",0
I love every other byron lars dress i've bought and this was a no brainer for me. when it arrived i was really disappointed. the fabric is very stretchy which makes it super forgiving and very thick. with all the buttons planted on this dress i was expecting it to open easily from the front as one of my other dresses by his does. nope. only the back buttons open. thick stretchy fabric and back buttons...not an easy thing to navigate. i was also very sad to see that the length was all wrong for m,0

"I love baseball style tees and when i saw the homebase tee (in two colors no less), i was very thrilled especially since it was during the 20% mother's day promotion on all items. based on the model's photos, the top looks flattering with a swing type style. i usually wear a medium and bought a small size in this top. when the package was delivered, i excitedly opened it and found two tees looking like maternity tops which would be lovely if i was pregnant. the tops are so wide not like the webs",0
"I have never taken the time to write a review but i was so disappointed by this dress. the design is cute and i got the medium instead of a small (i'm normally a 4/6) and i wanted to make sure it was a bit looser and below the knee. that was a good call because the fit is comfy and cute belted. however, it is so very thin and see through. i was looking forward to a cool, cotton dress for summer but this will definitely require a full slip if i decide to keep it. it came with no slip at all so th",0
"I love the design of this top, however, it's quality is lackluster. the shirt is pretty short and would be more flattering (at least on me) if it had a few more inches. also it's pretty sheer, so figuring out under garments is a dilemma. i will still wear it because i love it. looks great with a denim vest over it!",0
"I bought this shirt after reading so many positive reviews. it looks much thinner and cheaper than the photo depicts.  like many reviewers have said, it does hit just above midriff but the fringe covers your belly.  it didn&#39;t hang right on me and i felt like i was wearing a rug.",0
"Really cute top(especially the back)!  i've tried on several of these tops that overlap in the back and none of them lay as nice as this one.  the soft cotton fabric really works well with this style.  runs tts and i love that the arms are more fitted with some stretch to the fabric.  regular length works fine on my petite frame as well.  the color is a darker cream and almost has a slight nubby effect to it.  first one i received had a snag/hole in the lower sleeve, so hopefully it holds up.",1
"I have more of an athletic figure, and the sleeves tend to come in closer to the body than pictured. i didn't like that cut on my arms/torso. the shirt is really cute, otherwise! i am usually a size 4/small and this was a little short and snug.",0
"I love baseball tees and this looked like a more refined version, but it was huge and shapeless.  nice material and fabric but this one is going back.",0
So thin and see thru it's not even wearable in public. extremely cheap and ill fitting for any price let alone this price. i feel like they will rip the moment i wear them out. going back.,0
"Hi, i would have to agree with all of the reviewers.i unfortunately had to find out for myself. mistake. it's huge. i love the quality and design but even if you sized down two sizes it wouldn't help.",0
"I ordered this top online and was hoping to love it, however it didn't fit me properly...the arm holes were much too large (i'm typically an xs or small) i ordered the small and based on this fit i don't think the extra small would've fit either :( also i thought the material seemed very delicate and somewhat thin....and with 3 kids always hanging on me i don't think this top would last very long...",0
"I love the look of this sweater, but just bought and put on at home and noticed 2 pea sized holes in fabric, near arm holes, but not on seams. not sure if i bought this way and did not notice or if fabric is just incredibly delicate. will try to repair but scated this will not hold up... look it over carefully before you buy, they kind of look like moth holes...",0
"This sweater looks just as pictured on the model. its very warm though even with cropped sleeves. i ordered a large and it was true to size but roomy. i liked this top very much but is thicker than seems. outer grey material isn't very pleasant & itchy, however the bottom portion is an underneath gown and attached to sleeves inside so its very soft on touch.",1
What a let down. this is not what i would call a coat but a sweater. it is unlined and very lightweight. the fit was cute and would have been so great if it was actually a coat.,0
"I bought this in size xl. it is so much bigger than i expected. there are panels of material. it really is huge. not flattering at all. still, i kept it. the material is so soft & flowy. i've gotten good use wearing it around the house, doing chores, resting, etc. i wouldn't wear it out doing errands. but, around home, it's perfect for feeling cozy. such a strange cut. i don't know who would look good in it since it can look sloppy. i think many would enjoy wearing it at home.",0
"I wanted to like this coat so bad! i loved the bright red color and design, but when i received it, it seemed very cheap and just too large. i returned it.",0
"I have been looking for a fall/spring coat to wear when the weather is between 30 and 55 degrees. this ""coat"" looks great in the pictures, but so disappointing in reality. the best thing i can say is that the fabric is soft. it is unlined, so i'm not sure why you'd even wear it -- if the weather's warm enough to wear a thin, unlined jacket, why not just wear a sweater? the weight is not what i would expect at this price point. even worse, the design is terrible; my husband (who has a great eye)",0
Visions of sartorial splendor danced in my head as i planned my instagram posts centered around this coat. and then it showed up on my door and my dreams were crushed. i'd already read the reviews and knew the coat was unlined and would be oversized. i did not expect it to be soooo sloppy. especially around the collar. there is nothing crisp about it. i've had boiled wool outer ware before that held its shape much better than this. if i wanted fleece i wouldn't have picked retailer as the s,0
"This dress was so comfortable, i wore it all day - to church, out to brunch and actually slept in it. it would travel well, too.",1
I loved this shirt when i purchased it but it shrank badly and the front seam (on mine) was crooked. no longer have my receipt so not sure i can return it~ sigh. i do love the pilcro chinos i bought to go with it however!,0
I love this coat! it is exactly what i was looking for. it is unlined (with cute fabric edging on the seams) and a lightweight wool but it is roomy enough for layering and that is what i like about it. also like the length as it can conceal a long tunic sweater without it hanging out the bottom. it is very versatile in that it can be worn with something dressy or jeans and leggings. also like that i can add any fun scarf to dress it up or down. it's a great contemporary shape. i would say this c,1
"I love the way this coat looks in the website. it turned out to be a little different than i thought it would be. can't decide if i will keep it.
the sleeves are bracelet length, i have long arms so slightly awkward for me. i ordered the small even though i wear a medium in everything else (5'8"", 135 #). so glad i did because it is biggish on me.
it is unlined but made of a lovely, soft wool. the edges are all finished with a bias edging which is unique and well done. it is boxy, very.

"I had my eye on this one for awhile and decided to buy it when it popped back on my wishlist. i can see why someone returned it. the sweater top hits at the worst possible spot and made me look ridiculous, like a mushroom top. from the side i saw the potential, but not enough to save it. probably one of the worst things i have ever purchased from retailer.",0
I love this coat. it was a great purchase and i would reccomend it to others. it looks great with layers and is comfortable for 30-50 degree temps. definitely size down when buying.,1
"I ordered these in m (5'8"" 140 lbs.) and they are tts: they fit well and are neither tight nor loose. the issue that i have with them (and the reason that i sent them back) is that the material, although comfortable, is completely transparent; if i were to try to run out to get the mail in these, the whole neighborhood would essentially see me bottomless! furthermore, these are not white but off-white (and quite a yellowy off-white, at that), so these loungers don't look as cute with the feature",0
"This top is light and swingy with a bold pattern that looks even better in person. the neckline is very high, which was a surprise for a summer tank, but it's cut well. nice surprise: on seem pockets! wore it today for the first time and received many comments. a keeper. fits true to size and perfect for my petite build up top.",1
This is a great little top. colors are beautiful and more vibrant in real life. ordered size large and the fit is the same as the model. you could probably size down. armholes are a bit large but am picky about that area and i can work with it. the body flows but it's not huge and is slimming. the high neck and tie are darling. will be cute under a sweater or jacket as weather cools. good buy on sale.,1
"Super soft fabric, however very short in the stride. i ordered an xl, normally wear 12/14.  i had to return it.",0
"I love this jumpsuit. it's fun, flirty, and seems to put a smile on the faces of passersby. it works for multiple occasions/events, and is so comfortable. if daytime pajamas sounds good to you, this is your jumpsuit. dress it up with an up-do and dangly earrings, or down with slip-ons and a cardigan, i have found that i can't go wrong with it. fits me just perfectly, doesn't wrinkle too much during wear, and the adjustable shoulder ties are convenient.",1
"The photo misrepresents how large this sweater is. it is giant! petite ladies stay away from this sweater. i ordered an xs and usually can manage to fit in a regular xs, but this just floored me. the neckline wouldn't even stay up on my upper body, it was that loose. also the width of the sweater does not at all hug the body as shows on the model. it is like a tent. i'm so bummed. the color blue is nice and the sweater is really soft. it's too bad it doesn't fit smaller women.",0
"Love this shawl/wrap! was looking to purchase the white & warren cashmere poncho (but available online only), and then saw this in the store. tried it on and fell in love. love that it's 100% cashmere -- super soft and warm. would recommend!",1
"I got the cream color and absolutely love the style and color of this sweater. however, when i tried it on at the store, the one i tried on was super soft and comfy. i ended up finding this later on sale and ordered it online. when i got it, i don't know if it was once worn or washed by someone before, but the inside was not soft at all! i was so sad! anyone else have this experience? size is great. i ordered an xs.",1
"I have been searching for grey jeans and haven?t found anything that i truly love. i tried on both a 25p and 26p. the 25p was too tight and i don?t think they would have stretched out enough for me to be comfortable in. the 26p was close but i was afraid they would stretch out too much. they looked good from the front but did nothing for my cushion. the color, length and feel of the jeans was perfect. in the end they went back and the hunt continues for grey jeans. i would recommend trying these",1
"I saw this dress online and loved the colors and whimsical embroidery . i thought it would be the perfect dress to wear on the weekend with cute sandals. i was excited when the dress arrived in the mail as the colors were vibrant and the material was soft and cozy. unfortunately this dress is huge. it is a rectangle with pockets. i bought the xxsp, my usual size and this dress was so big my sister was able to fit in it with me.this dress was beyond alterations. too bad it was a great idea but no",0
This top is a good concept but the structure of it is not for all body types. i am 5.6 and 135 and wear an xs to a s in retailer tops and i ordered this is a small and it was huge in the chest and tight at my hips...will be returning.,0
Very cute print! love the mix of the colors on this sweater. looks great with jeans!! throw it on over a tshirt and you are set.,1
"I normally wear a size 27, but i have a pair of shorts by same designer bought several years ago in a size 26 and so i went with a size 26 for this purchase. they fit perfectly. i would have liked to order the petite, but it did not appear to be an option. the fabric is very soft and stretchy. they are little loose around the ankle, but i have very skinny calves and ankles, so that is not so surprising. the color is a perfect grey that will go with everything. i would buy these in other colors.",1
"This dress is 100% rayon, not silk like the description says. that doesn't bother me that much because it's a really cute dress! it's also hand washable, which i like! i hate going to the dry cleaners! it fits true to size, and i know i will wear it for lots of occasions ? from casual to business. i almost always wear a small in retailer dresses and this one is the same. i'm 5'3"" and the length hits me at the knee, so it might be too short for taller girls. the only other thing that was unexpected",1
"So disappointed. bought these in a 29 and should've gone with a 28. they're super cute - i got the green. the fit is off. like the other reviews, they stretch out way too much. i would return these but have already washed them. they wash terribly, too. there are weird fading marks all over, even when washed in cold water like the tag states. so disappointed that i spent my gift card from christmas on these. i've been a loyal retailer customer for years and this is the first time i've been severely",0
"The design of these ankles pants is very cool and the rise is perfect. however, the fabric, despite 2% spandex, has absolutely no give from the knee down. the extensive stitching probably contributes to the lack of stretch. while i was able to pull them on (size 27 for 110 lb/5.4'), i could not bend my legs at the knee comfortably. with longer wear, i think they would cut off the circulation.

please post if these stretch for you enough with wear and become softer.",0
"I was expecting elbow-to-full-length sleeves and like a previous review noted, they were short. very weird look for a wrap. returned.",0
"Love the fabric and it seemed warmed. but as other reviewers mentioned, the neckline was awkward.",0
I on the other hand wore these once and boy did they stretch during the day! i really hope they shrink back up...,0
"This sweatshirt is a very nice staple piece! i think it can be easily dressed up and down. the quality is quite nice and should hold up over time.

the sizing of this really depends on the desired fit. i elected to go with a size small because i felt that it fit a little bit closer to my figure and the length seemed to go better with skirts. but honestly, i tried the medium as well, and it was much different... just a bit more slouchy and looser in the arms if layering is desired. for reference,",1
"I was very disappointed when it arrived and had elbow length sleeves. from the photo, it looked like full length sleeves. it went back.",0
Obsessed with these pants. i have them in the green color and was looking for them to go on sale ! great fit very comfortable,1
"Really disappointing quality. these jeans are of a very poor quality material and developed holes in the inseams after only a month! i love pilcros, and am totally shocked at the poor quality...retailer, i hope this is just a fluke. not worth the money!",0
"Bought the green in the store. wore them every week for 3 weeks so i bought the bronze color too. i usually wear a 26 in pilcro because they do give a little during the day. i had to go up to the 27 because the thighs were a little too snug for me. there's a zipper at the ankle so getting you foot through isn't a problem. the fabric is sturdy. it almost feels like a brushed cotton (soft to the touch). they zip up the side so are very slimming. i'm 5'4"" 120# for reference.",1
"This dress is beautiful, i usually wear a 6 or 8 and i ordered a 4, it is huge, i will be returning.",0
"This dress either runs large or just has too much fabric. ordered my usual size, but it is too long and too baggy to do a thing for me. embroidery pretty, but background is more of a muddy gray, then denim as shown. if the smaller size in petite was available, i'd have exchanged it, but it is going back.",0
"If you like looking like a giant square and hide things this is the way to go. for me, it completely irradiates my shape, including my neck. this will be returned.",0
"I saw this t on sale and ordered it. i had second thoughts, thinking it would be just like a lot of ts i already have. well, i got it today and am thrilled. the fabric is so soft, a sumptuous softness that makes me feel good. the fit is the fit we all want in a great t, nice fit, not too baggy, not too tight, and it is so flattering. it doesn't show off my tummy as so many other ts do. i can wear this with jeans or a skirt. so glad i got it!",1
I tried this on in the store and it was huge. i couldn't try on a smaller size because they only had a 2 and 4. i tried on my usual size 12. i don't think the embroidery is as pretty in person either. definitely not worth the price.,0
"This dress is gorgeous in person, soft and wonderfully comfortable with two large pockets. it also comes with a cotton knit slip for added swing. i bought at size 6 which was two sizes smaller than my normal size 10 in retailer dresses. i have worn twice and each time 2 random strangers have complimented it. it dry cleaned beautifully and it is really fun to wear. the model is shows the neck wide open but it is very cute tied in a little bow. expensive maybe, but well worth it.",1
"This dress definitely runs large, so i ordered it through my local store, in order to get a size that would fit. i ordered one size down, but could have gone down 2. i love the embroidered design. i just wore the dress to a slovak festival, yesterday, and it fit right in :-) very comfortable, and fun to wear.",1
"This is a great feminine top i just wish it were a little bit longer for my taste, it hit about two inches below my belly button. it was a little snug around the belly area so that's why i feel it runs small for the brand, usually the brand runs true to size but not for this top",1
"First of all i love cashmere so by default i love this sweater shawl. the photos are a bit odd because you can wear it two different ways. if you wear it so it's long in front then the back comes up a bit higher and vice versa. my only big complaint is that i've worn it twice and there's already a large hole in the arm seam. poor construction which is disappointing. hopefully mine was a one-off.
i'd recommend it but definitely wait for a sale.",1
This is the oddest fitting pullover. there is too much fabric around the chest. it is fitted everywhere else but then balloons out in the front. i liked it at first but really started to dislike all the bunchiness (is that a word?). i gave it away..,0
"Lets discuss the neckline: it's fabulous!
furthermore, this sweater can go anywhere,
it's dress up, dress down.

feeling low? this girl will lift you up and take you to town.",1
"Love the length, color, and rise. new favorite jeans! they're a little loose around the ankle and the way they hang is the only thing i don't like.",1
"I am all about beach cover ups. i already have the leblon one from this season (which i loooooove) but i love this one too-and it is in my go-to color which is fantastic! i love beach cover ups, i always imagine the sounds of the birds, waves rolling in, and a nice breeze allowing it to flow as i walk along side the beach. my reality, of course, is chasing after screaming kids and walking along a mn pond (not rolling waves) but this dress would at least make me feel like i am in my own little wo",1
"I liked the colors of this dress and the material was fine, but i could not tell from the pictures that the seams at the waist are atypical and frankly unflattering. they are scalloped at the hips, so it looks horrible if you have any hips at all.",0
"Love the pockets and back of dress. the buttons on the the straps allow for them to be adjusted. that's a plus. i'm 5'3"" with an athletic build at 34d. the medium fits perfect",1
I bought an xl and they looked like they would have been a small. can't review anything else because i couldn't even get them on.... ridiculous,0
"I am 5'4"" 120lbs, got xs. it was huge on me. had to return it. very trendy, great quality, unfortunate design. not worth the money.",0
"These are very flattering thick leggings that would keep you warm in the fall and winter, but when i pulled them up i got a big hole in the seam at the waistband at my first trip to the bathroom! obviously you might expect a rip if they were too tight, but these fit perfectly (even on the looser side) and ripped effortlessly. pretty embarrassing given the price! bringing these back! 

for reference ( if you decide to try your luck), i am 5'7"", 128# and my normal size s was perfect.",0
"I loved the concept of the dress and that is why i chose to keep it in spite of the negatives. the grey color is drab, yet leaves room for creativity. it's stylish yet wrinkles horribly. i am 5' 2"" so it hangs too low in the front and armpits. another reviewer mentioned the buttons, yet there should be one more to bring it up in the chest. the pockets are a great space for hands, yet fabric is too thin and they are side slits, so will not hold much. i typically wear a 4 petite and the small fits",1
This coat is beautiful in color and design. we could have been great friends but it was waaay too big so i had to return it. i bought the smallest size possible yet i could have been 9 months pregnant and still would have had room to spare. i also was disappointed that the sleeves were not lined like other coats in this price range.,0
"I ordered this in both an extra small and a small... i found that there was a very big difference in the two sizes- the extra small was true to size and had a great width, but was shorter in length than i would've liked (if it shrunk at all, it would've been unwearable). the small was quite a jump in size and was a little wider than i liked, but i decided to keep that one. 

the top was very cute and comfortable when i wore it, however i just washed it once on delicate in cold water and when i",0
"This tank seemed like it should have been a maternity top. way too much fabric, not flattering for those of us with a larger bust. i am wearing a medium in the photos and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40.",0
Very comfortable great quality with beautiful crocheted front top and lovely blend of colors,1
Ordered med petite. love the print & design but it runs really big more like a large and length of top is not flattering . returning,0
I love the unique design! the details are wonderful. it runs a bit large but it works. a great piece.,1
These pants are amazing.  material on the thicker/heavier side.  the pants are very comfortable and very cute for the fall.  fits perfect,1
"Love the unique stitching on the shirt and the dye job.  i think it does run a little big.  the arm holes are quite deep even in a medium, but the fabric is thin so a tank underneath would probably work out well.",1
"I bought this today in black. it fits true to size and is very flattering. i love the draping, the weight of the fabric, and the length . i would buy it in another color i like it so much. i will probably wear this with jeans and boots with a sweater over it. i wasn't sure i was going to like the little connector piece across the front neckline, but it works. if it wasn't there the top would probably gape open.",1
"A beautiful shawl but not practical. i was impressed with how elegant/romantic it first felt/looked.  however, after 5 minutes of wear, it would not stay on my shoulders. the design is very awkward and despite several attempts with different tops/tanks underneath, i kept running into the same problem. lovely for the first 5 minutes of wear and then awkwardly/annoyingly wouldn't stay on my shoulders. the neckline is undefined and it just fell off. not a great design. disappointedly returned it.",0
"I tried this dress at the store today and couldn't leave without it. also tried the pacquerette shirtdress which has a similar boho/peasant vibe and overall preferred the fit and look of this one. plus, its lined, which the paquerette shirtdress is not for the same price. fit was very similar to the anwen peasant dress, which i also have, and the regular size xs fit me much the same as in that dress. it is maybe 1 inch longer though, but still that makes it a couple of inches above the knee for",1
"I saw this in the store and it caught my eye right away due to its bold color and pattern. i tried on an extra small and it was large, especially in the sleeves. i ordered an extra small in petite and it fits perfectly. i love the velvet and jeweled detail along with the cris cross tie. i wore it to work today and received so many compliments. one lady said how artsy i looked. i paired it with burgundy velvet tie up boots to complete the look. totally worth the money ladies!!",1
"This is a lovely top! sooo soft, very flattering draping if you have a bit of a tummy. i wasn't sure about it on the hanger but was pleasantly surprised when i tried it on- very glad i have it a chance!",1
"In a sea of dresses, this is the one that caught my eye in the whole store. i am a pear shape, and ended up trying both the medium and the large, taking the medium home. it was super flattering on, and was an appropriate length to pair with tights.

here's where the problem happened. i wanted to wear this dress for thanksgiving, i put it on, and as i tightened the drawstring to cinch in the waist - riiiiiiiiiip! the drawstring ripped through the fabric at the waistband. so disappointed.",0
Like the other reviewers i was disappointed to receive the gray dotted sweatshirt with a zipper down the center when it was not in the model picture. looks like this item has since been removed from this listing...would have been nice to have the correct item pictured in the first place.,0
"I was so excited to try this on in the store, because i've had my eye on it online. unfortunately, it is not like the picture. the material is very thin, almost translucent. i also could not figure out how it get it on! the cape has short sleeves, not long, as it appears in the picture, and the folds of fabric would not drape quite right in the front. love the look of black design on white. hopefully retailer can redo this in a thicker cape for the fall, but for now, i'll skip this one.",0
"This top is soft, flattering, modest enough to wear to work, but subtly sexy (and i'm amply endowed at 36d). i just wish i'd gotten one in every color.",1
"I'm upset. i ordered the grey sweatshirt and while the description says the sweatshirt has a zipper, the picture of the grey does not have a zipper. i prefer no zipper, so when it arrived in the mail with a zipper, i was disappointed. it's going back. why have a model where an item that you're not offering???",0
"This arrived today and i am thrilled with it. the material is soft but not at all clingy. it drapes perfectly, falling just above the knee. there is a matching slip that is as nicely made as the dress itself. what a find!",1
I loved the style so i ordered on line. it runs small and the arm inserts are so low its awkward to wear. i wish the cut was better cause i love the look but not the fit. i am returning this item..,0
"I wanted to love this dress - and did from the picture online. when it arrived, the black already looked faded and old. also, the embroidery looks like a grandma, but not in a cute vintage way. the fabric is stiff, which causes a boxy, unflattering look. had to return it.",0
"I also expected this sweater to have more bulk to it per the images. it is very thin as others have said. the design is awkward with the sleeve placement and that makes it more flowy vs. structured. it is more similar to a cape or shawl design. if you;'re looking for a warm cozy blanket sweater design, this is not it. i will keep it though as a layering piece and because of the sale price and classic color design.",0
"This is a busy dress that makes me think ""boho-glam holly hobby"". i bought my usual size and it looks like nightmare of a nightgown on me. i'm going to try a size smaller in the hopes i will love it more. i'm recommending this dress for those that like the quirky whimsical hippie eclectic crafty style.",1
"The pattern and fabric are lovely, but the sleeves are short (unlike the photo) so it drapes very strangely. i personally could not figure out how to wear it so that it looked anything remotely like the photo. had to return this one.",0
"I found this dress to run very large. the fabric was substantial but rather coarse. also, the lighter color in the pattern is lavender and not white or cream.",0
"I love this shirt, in fact, i love all bordeaux tops from retailer. i followed the instructions to hand wash only and after it was wet and then lay flat to dry, it may fit a child. it is a belly top. i want to love this, but it shrunk so bad even with the hand wash only instructions.",0
"I always have to try on tops of retailer. i know this, and yet i ordered a top through the website anyway. i don't think i'll do it again. the drape of the top seen in the pictures did not translate in real life because the top scratched up pretty quickly. ironically, when i washed it (according to directions) it also shrunk quite a bit.",0
"This top is very strange. i agree with the other reviewer in that i think it's not cotton. it clung and got bunched up around my chest. like in a static cling way. there's just something about the way it hangs that is not flattering. too bad as i was really looking forward to wearing this but alas, it's going back.",0
"I wanted to love this so much! i am 5'8 and normally do a size large in retailer, but based on the previous review i sized down. the top fit fine, but the bottom just sort of poofed out. not flattering. it does have pockets which are amazing, but overall, just wasn't a good fit. the top is t-shirt material, not denim.",0
I purchased this shirt to wear postpartum so i could easily be comfortable but still cute. it will work well for the fall with some cute jeans and booties. i cannot wait to wear it....any day now!  great choice.,1
"I ordered this top because 1. the online product page states the fabric is cotton. 2. i liked the style with the scarf insets. 3. the colorful embroiderey would be a welcome companion for my many pairs of pilcro chinos.

when i opened the package several tiny round beads rolled out. after examining the detailing, i found where the beads were missing.

size: i normally wear a small for most retailer brands, but i know nothing about slone rouge. i went with a small since it appears oversized on",0
"I love the color blocking but dress hangs a little strange on me. love the pockets, thought about sending it back and decided it is very comfortable, i will wear it but not quite what i was hoping for.",0
"Regarding the product, high quality materials and overall make. extremely comfortable and flattering cut. i'd love this in all the colors of the rainbow.",1
This top flows so nice. i get so many compliments when i wear it. plus the color is an interesting blue,1
To be clear i am not built like your models but the biggest problem was the way in which it tented out from the bustline down,0
"I ordered the blue version of this dress thinking the accent stripes were black. they were not ! they were wine colored. i liked the color, but not in combination with the other colors in the dress. black would have been a better look. i had to take it back. sad...",0
"Tried this on in the store - i love the colors but the cut was just not flattering. the liner was fine, but the dress flared out excessively and looked like a tent. tried it with a belt for some definition but the fabric was too thick.",0
"Very good quality. love the length of it. i wore it with a belt, since on me without it looked a bit too big. i bought the blue one.",1
"I ordered this after reading through the reviews. i realize the reviews were mixed, but thought i'd take a chance. unfortunately there were more things wrong than right with this dress. right: i loved the various colors (yes, it shows black but is actually brown). i also loved that it was lined and the lining was semi-attached to the dress, with the same hi-to-low hemline. wrong: as said by others, the sleeves were very tight! the dress is roomy and does swing but unlike the model, it isn't real",0
"After readying the reviews of this dress, i thought for sure i was purchasing a winner. boy, was i wrong! first, this dress feels like a potato sack and looked like one on. i felt that it was very boxy and more of a o' one size fits all' sizing. it did not embrace my curves at all. the material was not as chic as i would have thought. overall, the entire dress was not flattering. honestly, i do not understand what the rave reviews were talking about it.",0
"Too much material everywhere. i am 122lbs 5'4"" and i ordered an xs as usual. i was overwhelmed in a blanket of knitted material of muted colors. nice green slip, though. i will return it asap. this is super-ugly.",0
"Okay i'm short, so this tent dress is seriously huge on me and not flattering. the fabric is so pretty, but this dress must be for a tall girl. no shape at all!",0
"This dress hangs horribly. unlike the photo, the waist does not cinch. too bad. the colors are great and the quality of the material is nice. because i bought it on sale, i may try to tailor it to work, but unless you are willing to do that, its a no go. :-(",0
"I almost missed this, i snagged it during the black friday sale online. i got an extra small and it fits great-not too fitted. the back is a cotton material with some stretch to it. the embroidery is beautiful.",1
"This was pretty to look at: nice weight, lining, colors. i tried it on and whoa. ridiculously bad. i have broad shoulders and a small waist and this accentuated the broadness of my shoulders and eliminated any hint of shape below that. the model photo looks great, so i imagine this will look great on anyone with slim shoulders and narrow hips. definitely not for me, though...",0
I am returning the dress. it has too much volume and is not flattering at all,0
"I bought both color options in this dress and they are both gorgeous but i think this dress must only look good on the model and her body types because i put it on and cringed. i'm 5'7"" and slim. it was matronly. i also ordered my usual size small and felt like the medium might have been better? the picture of blue colored dress looks more fitted around the waist and these dresses and very loose. the only way it would be flattering is if you added a belt. keep that in mind if you do buy. pretty",1
"Love this dress! the stripes are flattering, the material is interesting and it swings! it's feminine and fun!",1
"This is a beautiful looking dress, but definitely runs wide and long. i'm 5'4, 112llbs and my normal xs swallowed me up. if it had been available in xs petite then that probably would have worked, even though i normally never go with petites. it is a gorgeous dress, and would probably work on those ladies who are taller.",0
"By itself, this dress is a disaster. it's semi-maternity and offers no shape at all. however, with a belt, it really becomes the sweetest sweater dress. i can't believe how flattering the dress becomes with a belt, the skirt falls perfectly , it's perfect, especially with it's rich colors.

for $50, you can't go wrong and i'm positive you need this dress. boots, heels, jacket, whatever, it goes up and down, it's perfect!",1
"I have worn this beautiful sweater with all kinds of outfits! i love to dress it down with ripped skinnies, booties, & some long layered necklaces. i did not have as big an aversion to the itch factor as the other reviewer, but it is definitely not super soft or anything. it fit a little larger than true to size in my opinion. i should've ordered a small. i think it's a very unique winter staple that matches almost every single thing in my wardrobe. it's versatile, snuggly, & warm i'd recommend",1
"I saw online, great quality sweater dress- reviews about seemingly extra fabric- easy fix with a seamstress. i have very sensitive skin and wear long sleeves under sweaters. wool, angora, mohair! 5'1, xsp, tts (length/arms) but lots of extra fabric for width. just trying it on was too itchy for me.",0
This runs super big and it just wasn't flattering--way too much fabric. i wanted to love this dress.,0
"I walked into a hair salon wearing this dress, and everyone who walked by complimented me. to me, that's a definite winner! i got the blue color, and the various colors in it are vibrant and lively. the underdress is like a full slip and an added bonus. this probably also makes the dress hang the way it should. there's no static or clinging where there shouldn't be. i was afraid i might be too short to pull this off, but i absolutely love it.",1
"I saw this dress online first and suspected i would like it, but the price scared me away. then, while visiting in portland, i saw it on sale at an retailer store. when i came out of the dressing room to look in a bigger mirror the store clerk said, ""well that's a no-brainer!"" i thought the same thing. i love this dress so much i actually would have paid full price for it. it's super fun and easy to wear; i paired it with navy blute tights and suede ankle booties. i'm 5'6, 138 lbs and the m",1
This colors and fabric of this dress are beautiful and i really wanted to love it but from the chest to the hips there is too much fabric and it give you no shape at all. it had to go back.,0
I just got this at the black friday sale..... i may have passed it by had i not been in an adventurous mood ( i usually wear brighter colors). it feels wonderful....cozy and silky like expensive pjs!! looks very glamorous yet laid back... i feel like i am in a 40's romantic film.. i got a ps and it fits flowy. it was the only one so i was not able to try the xs. love it! it was cold today so i wore a cami under it with lace peeking thru the low neckline .,1
This dress fits great and is very warm for the winter months.,1
"I bought this dress online and was hoping it would be a great comfortable staple.. it may be the most unflattering piece of clothing i have ever tried on ever! i let my sisters try it on too, to see if they wanted it or liked it better, but it was awful on them as well. i ordered the xs in blue. it was beyond enormous and was just plain and unflattering. i am 5'7' and 115. i love swing dresses,i just don't think is cut well.",0
Ilove this dress even though it does run big i put a belt with it and it looks stunning.,1
"This looked fabulous on the model, of course, and i love sweater dresses. but even in an xs, i was drowning in fabric and looked ludicrous. concept is good but execution went terribly wrong somewhere. a definite return.",0
"I love this dress. based on reviews, i ordered the small, and the only problem i had was that, while the dress is quite large, the detachable slip lining was quite tight and fitted, which i didn't find comfortable. so i replaced it with a flowy silk slip of my own, and the results are great. the fiber content contains a bit of wool, but i do not find it scratchy to my skin. and i am lovin' the hi-lo aspects of the hem. fun dress for winter!",1
"... for the model to look like this?
pros: nice quality. the colors of the blue version, at least, are rich and beautiful. note that the dark color pictured is really brown, not black. the colors are also much brighter than they appear in the picture. it is a medium to heavy weight sweater knit which is well suited for fall-winter. it is layered over a bright navy poly slip.
cons: i am 5'8 135# . i looked like i was wearing a circus tent in med. the sleeves were more dolman than fitted. i imagin",0
"I wore this dress for the first time the other day and it fit larger than i expected. it is definitely not form- fitting, however, i still love it. just note the previous description if that is the sort of fit you were looking for. as far as the length goes, i am 5'3"" and the dress covers my knees.",1
"I wish this dress was more fitted.. the dress looks more fitted and more vibrant in the picture. i bought this dress in an xs, but i am not sure that going smaller would take care of the amount of material in this dress. it was shapeless and did not fall as nicely as it appears. i think someone with a fuller figure would look very nice in this dress. sad to say that it is going back.",0
"This is a great addition! it's comfortable, pretty, and can be dressed up and down. most importantly it's slenderizing and a great length for me! i bought it in my regular size, but bought the petite size, noting the model is 5'10"" and where the dress stopped on her. i'm 5'6"". the dress fits perfectly and is a great length for me! it also comes with a lovely, blue slip! such great quality for the price!",1
"Really wanted to love, the top was very flattering and loved the material: very swingy and forgiving. but way to much material, i was drowning in it. sized down to x small but no go.",0
"Another reviewer mentioned this was maternity-ish. i am currently almost 5 months pregnant, and i have to say: this is a wonderful maternity dress, even if that's not what it was made for. when not pregnant, i think this might have been a little overwhelming (and i guess we'll see next year if that's the case for me) -- there is a lot of fabric here. i am usually a small or medium in antrho dresses, and i am wearing a small in this now with room to grow as my stomach grows. the colors on the blu",1
"I'm 5'4, 115 and the xs swallowed me like a snuggie. i suppose the tons of fabric might drape nicely if you're 5'8 and above? it drooped and hung comically large from every angle under arm, body and skirt. a belt was no match for that much fabric. the colors are gorgeous and it appeared well made, but the design was awful.",0
"I love the style of this jumpsuit. it is so much more interesting than a long dress. i am 5' 7"" and need a few inches hemmed which will cut off some of the pretty embroidery at the bottom. my biggest regret with this is that it is not made from better fabric. it is a little stiff and scratchy. if it were more silky it would be a dream. but i am happy to have this in my closet. i purchased this in the berry red.",1
"Originally i bought this in black and white. recently purchased several more in different colorways . why? it's just perfect to wear as an under tank/cami. i'm a busty gal and sometimes cami straps can be too thin and dig into my shoulders. this is soft, smooth and provides just enough coverage. very flattering fit on its own as well. great under loose knit or low cut sweaters. love!",1
"I am an retailer employee, i love this romper and suggested it to several of my regular ladies the day it arrived in our store. they both loved the piece before they tried it on...the jumpsuit is so cute and has the special flair of a piece you would expect to find at retailer. the piece is lined which is an added bonus but there is where the issue with the jumpsuit arrives. the lining is to short makes it feel awkward. i ordered the xxs petite, and it fits perfect, except the inside l",1
I disagree with other reviewers on this. it looks a lot better in picture on the model. i found it to run large and not fit in the most flattering way. fabric feels great. i want to love it but it is going back.,0
"I love this tank, it is so comfortable but it does have its flaws. it rolls up every time i walk or do anything, it becomes very bothersome.",0
"Yummy, soft material, but very faded looking. so much so that i am sending it back. if a faded look is something you like, then this is for you.",0
"Terrible fit for a longer torso.  runs small in hip and lining, huge in the waist.  not good for an hourglass figure!",0
"The reason i gave this an overall rating of 4 stars is because of the sizing. the jumpsuit runs big and the black does not have a petite option; otherwise, i would give this 5 stars. this jumpsuit is so gorgeous that i had to buy both colors. i bought the black in medium and it looks absolutely beautiful on but i will have to take it to get it altered; it is way too big on me. i really need a petite in this but i still bought the black and am getting it altered. 

i loved this jumpsuit so much",1
Beautiful dusty rose color! the fit is fabulous! love the sleeve and hem length! very flattering and does not cling.,1
"I really liked the fabric and the design of this sweater, but the sleeves hung at an odd length (no way to push them up like on the model) and the sweater was large on me. i have broad shoulders but am otherwise petite. unfortunately i had to return this. glad others are having better luck.",1
This tank is soft and flexible. great fit with wonderful material. very pleased.,1
"This is an awesome piece and i got many complements while wearing it! it is that rare combo of super comfortable yet amazing look all in one. it does run a bit big, especially on top but the stride is short so i had to keep my regular size or i would have had a wedgie all night.",1
"I recently wore this to a beach wedding, and it worked out great with a cute denim jacket. the orange color is pretty and vibrant, and it is comfortable to wear. i like the length of it, and it flows really well as you walk. the cons are that it wrinkles really easily; i used a steamer extensively when it arrived to steam out the wrinkles, but it still had a wrinkled look to it because i think of how the seams are. as i got back up from sitting down for 10-15 minutes, the front and back were alr",1
"I really couldn't tell if i like the dress or not - it was swimming on me and i always wear a size small. design is great with cross straps in the back, thin, silky fabric. i would call the color more of a bright coral/orange - not a bright red.i'll get back if i decide to try ordering the xs. . .",1
"Received this jacket yesterday...and it is lovely.
very well made with a relaxed yet feminine fit.
the cobalt blue accents are not as vivid as they appear online, was slightly disappointed with that, but being more subtle will make it more wearable...so no ""oh she is wearing that jacket again""....
the forest green is rich and elegant.
the fit is true to size, but this is not a fitted jacket, it falls more straight, but the peplum is a gorgeous accent. 
a classic with impeccable quality!",1
"I really liked the color and style of this dress, but the proportions were off. the top was too small and the waist was too large. if you are more uniform in size/shape and less of an hourglass this dress may be perfect for you!",0
This is a well made blouse with a pretty neckline. the print with the sleeves makes me look really wide. it's an odd look.,0
"I know the photos for this dress show it as a very ""casual"" dress, but i find it very elegant.i really love this dress. it is very simple, but that is what makes it stunning. . the fabric is heavy enough to drape perfectly. it fits really nice on top - my bra fits just fine underneath and doesn't show. i'm a short gal and i will have to wear a small heel even though i purchased an xxs petite. i'm fine with that. nice quality, fits well - done deal for me!",1
"Now, i ordered both striped versions and i don't know which to keep... the material is a nice soft knit. the neck line is almost boat-neck, with little buttons, so cute. colors are really nice too. i tried it on with skinnies and trousers,a nd ti looked great with both. i went with the petite version, for those shorter gals out there... xxs petite fit me, i havne't tried o the xs petite yet. (5'1.5"" and 115 lbs). i think it would loke nice with a pencil skirt too, if i only had one that went wit",1
"Loved the fabric of this dress, and the slip that comes with it. i wish the waist line fit a little better though. i am 5'4"" with an athletic build and it looked really boxy on me. i was so disappointed. thought i could synch it in to make it work, but think this is a return.",1
The material is awesome and it's a super pretty dress it just didn't work on my body.,0
"Couldn't make it work, even belted. ivory color is darker irl--dingy light tan, like dirty vintage. ""drop"" waist is not dropped at all, just a maternity-ish cut that starts boxy-loose high up (below bust), then abruptly flares out at bellybutton level (not low hip) into the skirt. i usually find a-line cuts good at giving illusion of a willowy, curvy waist, but this does not--adds ten pounds. poly fabric heavy/hot; rayon lining awkward and doesn't flow/drape. (5'3'' 127lb 34a, tried xs)",0
"I am 5' 4"" and 128 lbs and could have worn the 4 or 6 but took the 6. it does run short and the length in the 6 was better than the 4 with arm hole size being the same. the bees are embroidered making the fabric high quality and normally i would run from a print like this but not this one. it has great style!",1
I really love this dress. i cannot believe how many people have complimented me on this dress and ask where i bought it. the color is so soft and pretty. the dress is comfortable as well. it looks great with a light pair of wedges.,1
"I'm 5'3"" about 130lbs and ordered a size 6. the print on the fabric is as expected but the shape of the dress and fit were not good at all. i probably would wear a 4 instead of the 6, but could tell that even if i had the 4, the cut of it still wouldn't be flattering on me at all. it was baggy in odd places and had no shape. the outer fabric is very sheer and see through and the lining is nice, with a fitted slip design.",0
"I saw that there was metallic detail when i ordered it, but i wasn't prepared for the entire thing to be metallic. it fit tts, but wasn't what i was looking for.",0
"Fabulous fabric, adorable details. fitting is very, very odd. it's non-adjustable in any way. the fabric has no stretch at all around the middle and the underwire of the bra is very stiff which i found painful. the straps were kind of loose, but there is no way to tighten them because of the frills. when i bent over, the shorts exposed the bottom of my butt. i'd get a larger size, but then i can't adjust the straps and they would definitely be too long and leave my breasts very exposed. overall,",1
"Fun versatile top for casual wear with capris, denim, or shorts/skirts. purchased both striped versions. love ballet necklines. the 3/4 length sleeve is wonderful for spring, summer, fall in california. the top is fitted yet it runs small. be sure to sized up. i normally wear xs, however this was way too tight. so i've ordered a small in both. hoping it works perfectly.",1
"Love the fabric of this button-down. runs really large, however. am usually a small or xs - so bought a 4. it's ok, but is incredibly boxy and stands away from the body -- & not in a good way. i think it probably works well tied at the waist, but, alas -- i am too old to be showing off that part of my anatomy. returned reluctantly! hope others will enjoy!",1
"This has a cute aesthetic on the hanger but not so great on- at least for my body type. i am 5'10"" with broad shoulders and slim, and both the arms and dress length were too short. in addition, the size 8 was boxy and unflattering. sizing down to a 6 would have exacerbated the length issues.",0
I'm 5'1 and a tad busty and this sweater i found to be most flattering. i saw it i. the store on was drawn to it. i love the shimmer but perhaps that's because the holiday feel is already in the air in nyc. the m fit great in both length pans width. it looked great with my straight black jeans and boots. i felt it made me look thin. thankful i bought it on a discount day! it's a fabulous sweater.,1
So cute! a definite add for this summer. sizing and pattern are both on-point. would be cute with so many bottoms,1
The sleeves are a bit too voluminous and the solid color collar stands out a bit too much.  but it's a cute pattern and style.  very comfortable.,1
This is a nice tunic but i wish it was a bit more structured. the band in the back helps hold it together so it doesn't balloon out but a few more pin tucks would have been nice. i do like the length and style as a alternate to a white button down shirt and it looks super cute with skinny crop pants.,1
"This sweater was in-store in a more neutral color palette and was so pretty. when i tried it on i noticed a few things: the versatility and quality are definitely there - this is a nice piece even at full-price. the downside is that it runs very large. i'm typically a 14/16 and a size xl in most retailer items, and even the large was a bit roomy. the other thing was that the sleeves of this sweater are pretty long (and i have long arms). due to the bell cut of the sleeve you couldn't even really c",1
"I received this dress today and can not be happier. i'm 5'6"", 120 lbs, 34c, and the 2 fits perfectly, hitting about 1.5"" above my knees. the print is so pretty and elegant. the colors aren't too vibrant, aren't too muted. the collar and french cuffs give the dress an extra flair. it comes with a little slip because the dress is sheer. i just tried it on with suede booties and it looks adorable! i'm ready for cooler temps to arrive so i can wear it!",1
"I got this dress in the mail today, and it's one of the best dresses i've ever gotten at retailer.. the material is of high quality and feels silky against the skin. the fit is true to size for maeve, and is so flattering. for reference, i'm thin (116 lbs), but curvy and usually order a regular xs. in maeve, i'm usually an xsp, and the xsp fit perfectly. it looks good with a wide cream colored crocheted belt (also from retailer), or on its own.",1
"I am busty and have a difficult time wearing stripes because they are not that flattering. the stripes on this top are narrow, and the material is thin which makes this great to wear under a jacket if you want to dress it up. i am 5 feet tall and ordered both the regular small and the ps because i wasn't sure which sleeves would be best on me (as far as the length goes.) if you want the sleeves to look like they do on the model order the petite if that's what you usually order. you can also get",1
Had to return. ordered an xs which usually fits perfect. 34b chest and it was falling off. shoulders and chest!! it was like a sleeping bag. huge fan of retailer but there is a design flaw in this sweater.,0
"I bought this sweater online as soon as i saw it. but like the other reviewers i agree it is shapeless and sticks out too much at and below the waist. if it were a softer fabric maybe the flair would work but not for this one. i am 5' 2"", 115lbs, 32d and got the xs. maybe if you aren't chesty it won't flare out as much. sadly i had to return it. i was so excited for it, o well.",0
"As previously mentioned, this dress runs very large. i ordered accordingly, and the small was the right size for my frame, but it was just not flattering. i'm pear shaped, and i found the shoulders to be large, the neck a bit too high, and the overall cut to hug my figure in a very unflattering way. i'm 5'4"", 140-ish, and maybe if i were a few pounds lighter and a few inches taller, it could've worked. i so wanted to love this, because it's soft and comfortable and cute, but back it goes.",0
"I wanted the blight yellow as photo with navy flower motifs. however it was much more darker as on the tag, mustard. if you like its color you will like it.",1
The model looks like she's 14 years old - this sweater of course would fit a younger teen. it definitely won't work for a grown woman. please make some longer sweaters.,0
"I just received this dress and i feel like a goddess in it! it is perfect for graduations, weddings, romantic dinners, tropical va cations....heck, i'll wear it to the grocery store! i love it that much!

i am 5'7"" with a 34c bust.....i have this dress in a size 4 and it fits very well. this dress is slim cut from the shoulder down to the waist. the dress length hits me at the lower calf, just like the model online. i think the armholes are cut a little high...this being said; this dress would",1
"This sweater was unflattering me, very boxy and did not fall on me like the model. soft fabric and looks nice off, however this one went back.",0
"This dress was so cute and comfortable! i said it runs big, but i think that may also simply be the style of it. i paired it with some cute boots and received many compliments! love it!!",1
This sweater did not flatter a sz 12 with 36d chest. it's very well made but not for the curvy girl. this is my very first review and felt compelled to share my thoughts since i heavily rely on others' reviews before i purchase.,0
"Yay hei hei! love these pants. thanks to the roll-up, they show a nice bit of ankle. lightweight but sturdy?i've been reaching for them when it just seems too hot for jeans. they're a little poufy toward the top (below the waist), but the tie waist makes them sufficiently cinchable. i expect to get a lot of wear out of these this summer. i did experience some stretching/sagging after a full day of walking, moving, and sitting, so i bought my second pair in m instead of l. (got navy and went back",1
These pants look nice and are comfortable but the quality of the fabric is terrible! i should not be surprised because i bought another pair of pants by this same label at antro earlier this year and they did not hold up at all either. but i thought i'd give it another shot. never again! i'm on my 5th wear and the crotch and inner thighs have worn away completely...i mean huge holes in the fabric where it's just disintegrated. even at extra % off the sale price it's not worth it. the full price,0
"This is simply a fabulous dress. i think the issue with the other reviewers is that they are too small (though there is nothing wrong with that). i am not. i am older and heavier, and the dress fits very well. i'm also rounder on the bottom so it is not baggy or tent-like. the material and texture of the yarn is soft and comfortable. you can wear it all day at the office and into the evening. it looks great with a jean jacket, for example, and booties. and it also looks terrific with flats. it d",1
"This dress is a lovely creation! however, i had to buy it three times before finding the proper fit. it runs extremely large!! i am 5'4"", weighing around 128. i ordered a 4 petite the first time because others stated this dress ran small. ha! it was a sack!!! the 2 petite was little better. the 0 petite was perfect! but i have never worn a 0 petite in my entire life!

otherwise, this dress is an original that i will enjoy for many years to come! if only it had been made of silk, it would be un",1
"I bought this is in the gray color, although imo it has more of a greenish hue. i love it. it's a wide boxy fit like others have said, and tends to fall off the shoulder. i purchased it in the small (my typical size) and it definitely seems to run large (it relaxes too as i wear it, giving it an even roomier feel). that said it's very cozy & comfortable. i wear a tank underneath. works well for 50's and 60's weather.",1
"Bummer, i loved the lacy bell arms and everything about the look of this sweater but it is huge in the abdomen. seriously looks maternity to me. the neck is also too wide. the quality of the material is very nice and the weight is nice and heavy but the cut just didn't work on me. i returned this one.",0
"These pants are so great, light, comfortable and reasonably priced. they are very well made, and the soft fabric is perfect for summer traveling and hiking. there's a bit of elastic in the waist which i like since pants usually gap at the waist on me. they're like classier lounge pants.",1
Good reason to read reviews. i concur with others in that it fins large and looks boxy. heavy fabric makes matters worse.,0
"I ordered the small and it fits ok,i probably could have went with an xs but i am keeping the dress.it is a very beautiful dress.this dress can be worn for casual or dressed up for evening.very versatile dress and well made.i did get it on sale which made it very affordable. i am only 5'3"" and the length in the regular s is fine for me.",1
"I am 5'8 and 220lbs (extremely muscular) i ordered a size large and it hangs very nicely over my curves, the neckline looks pretty good with my broad shoulder, and the dress comes about 4 inches above my knee. i think people with curves would really like this dress but it does lack shape so beware if you're looking for something with some structure. the blue is gorgeous and the fringe details are very cute. this dress does seem to run a bit big.",1
"While i loved the sleeves on this sweater (the lace detailing was beautiful) the core area was really big. i agree with another reviewer who said it looked like a maternity top. i was hopeful but i sent it back. i am 5'7"", 128lb and ordered the small.",0
"While i loved the material, color and concept of the dress, it was much too large and sack-like. i'm 5'2"" and 108 lbs, pear-shaped. i purchased the regular xs given stated length in the description. while the length was just right, it was just much too large throughout. i'm not sure that even an xxs will help so sadly, this will be going back.",0
This sweater is even better looking in person. the body of the sweater is substantial - a nice weight. the lace is gorgeous. i usually wear a size large but found the sleeves really long. i purchased a medium and it fits better - sleeves are perfect.,1
"I agree with the other reviewers; this sweater was strangly shaped in the waist, in an unflattering way. the rest of it was beautiful though. looks too much like maternity, even in a petite xs, so it's going back.",0
"This is a beautiful skirt; the colors are fresh and summery, yet subtle, and it's a nice sturdy cotton, not flimsy and cheap looking. however, i agree with the reviewer who said that this runs small. i take a 4 in most skirts, but i had to try on a 6 and still felt that it didn't fit quite right. if you're extremely thin, this might be great for you.",0
"I ordered this online and i love the style, but didn't like the print as much as i thought i would.",1
"This is a lovely sweater--unique, nicely made, though i found that it ran large for me. i was between a size xs and small, and neither one seemed just right so i ended up returning it. the small had the right length in the arms and torso, but was too wide in the torso and shoulders, and the xs was too short. bummer! also found that every single ivory one had stains or spots on them in my local store, not sure why. if i had been able to settle on the right size i probably would've kept it!",1
"These pants are really great! the fabric is soft, but substantial, and the fit is so comfortable. i bought the ""grey"" color - it's a very light grey, almost a stone color. it's a perfect neutral to wear with just about any top you may have. i love the deep front pockets and the elastic waist is an added bonus. i'm 5'5"", 124 lb. and purchased the small.",1
"Very high quality fabric and the fit is excellent. the skirt is stylish yet simple and very easy to wear as i feel i would have no trouble paring it with several different tops. it can easily be dressed up or down and is excellent for work. i got this on sale and am so glad, still, it is one of the few items actually worth the initial high price tag. great quality!",1
"These pants are so comfy i'm getting a second pair. i ordered the olive color in a small/reg, im thinking of ordering the xs next time since they do stretch out a great deal as the day goes on. would definitely recommend these for sure. hope this review is helpful as i struggled with ordering petite or not. glad i didn't!",1
"Loved everything about this sweater but the short length.  didn't notice in the pictures but the last one of the back of the model shows the length. it barely reached the very top of my jeans so would have to wear something under or i'd be flashing my stomach all the time.  worked a bit better with skirts, but still too cropped for my frame. wish it was 1-2"" longer in length and would have been a new fall favorite. really great color and design besides that. just make sure you are wanting the sh",1
"This dress was stunning on the hanger -- on me not so much. i am 5' 1.5"" and typically a sz 2. the smallest size at the store was a 4. i felt it was baggy about the waist and the length would have been better in petite sizing. the print is gorgeous with beading accenting different flowers. there is a tinge of green-yellow to the background fabric and the color did not look good on me. i hope to try this in a 4p.",1
"I love this cotton weave shift dress. it is supposed to be loose and not tight. i purchased a medium and fits the way i see it should fit. ref: 34dd, 148 lb; 5'4 height. hits above the knee but office appropriate as not too short. i paired it with a few seasons ago, the navy blue suede fringe jacket by retailer elevenses; new necklace in the blue motif from retailer ( it has a hanging druzy pendant) navy hose and navy crew neck long sleeve top.  great outfit for work and an after work party at retailer",1
This is another item i've been stalking that i thought miraculously made it to sale with my size still available. i ordered online but when it arrived i have to be honest i didn't even try it on because i knew it would be going back. the beautiful print online looks really cheap irl on the flimsy fabric. the beaded detail on neck is basically a low grade sequin trim. so much potential just executed poorly.,0
"The sleeves on this top always caught my eye every single time i was in a store. they never had my size to try on, so when a free shipping offer came up, i ordered the ivory top in a size large. well, the sleeves are indeed stunning, but that is all that is attractive about this top! the rest was a plain, blank, white canvas. in fact, that's what it felt like to wear it -- like i was wearing a tent or an artist's canvas on my chest. yuck! how can this designer put so much thought and care into t",0
"I went with my usual size, but it is too tight, it fits, but i would feel uncomfortable in it. i ordered the pink one, which looks nice in the picture, but in person, it looks cheap. the beading at the neckline immediately looked to me like cocktail dresses my grandma used to wear in the 1970s. that beaded neckline added to the cheap look. this one is not for me.",0
"I just bought this and i really disagree with previous review that it runs big - i wear an 8 in skirts and bought another retailer skirt last week that fits just fine - this one does not even zip up. i might exchange for bigger size, as label is just a number to me and sizes are really inconsistent - or it may just go back.",0
"The lace inlet sleeves on this comfy top add unexpected detail that dresses it up. you can wear this with jeans or skinny cords, as well as a fitted skirt. the material is comfy and the neck is not too tight, nor too loose.
i usually wear a small and the small fit the best. i tried the xs and medium and although they both fit, the xs seemed a bit too short and the medium was too long in the arms.",1
"This sweater is much more cropped than shown. the sweater i received was only 24 inches long. the color of the trim is black, not the navy or plum that i expected. quality does seem good.",0
I can not imagine the cut in the waist being flattering on anyone. i ordered an xs and an xxs still would have flared too much in the waste. i ignored the previous review and that was a huge mistake!,0
"I went back and forth on whether to purchase this dress, and i'm so glad i did. the fit was perfect. i'm always a little hesitant about long dresses since i'm 5'2"", but the petite length was perfect. the quality is great and the dress is so comfortable, but i feel elegant in it. i wore it for rehearsal dinner at my wedding and plan on wearing it again for a wedding next month.",1
"Dress appears to be slim fit, but that's far from the case. usually wear an xs regular because i have a long torso for my 5'3"", but it just hung on me like a heavy sack. i have a hard time finding dresses now that i'm not working and like to have a couple on hand for all purpose occasions--weddings, memorials, special occasions. i hoped this one would meet my needs. disappointed.",0
"This a a great sweater! it is classic, but has the fun surprise element of the lace bell sleeves. loved it so much i got the black and the sea mist. looks great with jeans or leggings! the only negative is you can call it that is that the sleeves are a tad long for me. compliments everytime i wear!",1
"I ordered this sweater in xxsp and the sweater is still very large on me. it is definitely a sweater that is supposed to hang off of your shoulders, however, i'm finding that it wants to fall all the way off of me. the quality is nice. it is medium in weight. it has a cottony feeling, but it not super soft. it looks way better on the model shown than in person to me. i wanted to love it, but i only just like it. i think others will like this if you are looking for a fun, loose look in a sweater.",0
"I ordered an xxs petite and this hangs like a bag on me. i'm usually fine with the petite sizing, but this didn't work and i'm so bummed. the dress is soft, the blue color is gorgeous, but it fits like a bag. i wanted to love this, but sadly will have to return. i think someone with curves will love this dress. it is really beautiful quality, just does not fit a petite frame.",0
"I debated buying this, so glad i did. tts. i'm 5'5"" 115 and 32c. i got size 2, and it worked but i could have done a 0 (which is my usual size). i was afraid to order it too small because i needed it right away! this dress is gorgeous! i got the pink color way and it is more vibrant in person. the beading is beautiful, it's incredibly soft and flowy! this dress is probably my favorite dress ever! if you're on the fence, order it!",1
"I loved these pants and purchased them in three colors. like another reviewer, within a few weeks, having worn them no more than a couple of times, the fabric in the crotch area started to wear thin and two pairs developed holes. i was not hard on the pants - just wore them to the office - and line dried them. so disappointing, as i really did love the pants. total waste of money.",0

pros:

"I've been buying from retailer for the last 15 years and this is the first time i've ever posted a bad review. first of all the fabric is scratchy, thin, and looks very cheap. second of all there is no v back, it's more of a slight scoop. and lastly i'm 5'3"" so i ordered the petite small and it's still comes 4 inches below my knee. i am very disappointed in the quality and am definitely sending back. the only thing i think this could possible good for is a swim coverup.",0
"I liked this top, i really did. i also liked the subtle shimmer. the fabric didn't seem as soft, but i could not get over the big difference in length between the front and the back. you can see it on the model here, but when i tried it on it was even more obvious and just didn't look right. asymmetrical tops look better when the length difference is not so large, but here it is. the print at the top also made my shoulders look a little broader. i am sending it back.",0
"I love this dress. i agree with the other reviewers that the rhinestone linkages do very easily get caught on the lace part of the dress and i could see it snagging very quickly. that said, i am going to keep it and hope for the best because it is absolutely gorgeous. it is not actually a true white as it looks pictured. instead we, it is more of a nude color, but it adds to the flattering nature of the dress and makes it look sheer. the embroidery is beautiful. my only complaint is that it will",1
"Oh what a disappointment! i was looking forward to wearing this as a layering piece with the shawl cardigan. the material lacks serious quality and it was ripped on the seam. so, back it goes. and, i am flabbergasted at the price retailer is charging almost $60 for this top!",0
"Beautiful, unique design. it's very flattering the way the fabric hangs.

i usually wear a 10, but because the lining is much smaller than the dress (which many linings are... it's a pet peeve of mine), i sized up to a 12 and took in the shoulders a couple inches so the bodice area would sit correctly on my bust. otherwise in the 10 my stomach would feel squeezed even if it looked like it fit perfectly. that said, i'm very sensitive to that kind of thing.

other reviewers have noted that the emb",1

the embroidery does catch on the beading so you have to handle it carefully. it's worth the special treatment, though!",1
I love this top. i had no issues with fabric. it is soft and light. the wrist details are very pretty. i love the buttons. it fits true to size and it is a good layering top. i got the red which is true to the picture. not looking red but a bright coral color.,1

"This skirt is definitely not what i was expecting. the material is stiff and rough. the skirt is also loud. you can hear it swishing when you move, and not in a classy way. it feels like you're wearing a very long tutu. also, the pattern isn't quite as pretty in person. they must have used magic in order to make this skirt look flowy in the photos - it does not flow.",0

"Bought this dress on sale - i haven't decided if i'm going to keep it yet or not, because i'm not sure if it's flattering to my bubble butt. i normally wear a 6-8 in retailer (5'6"" 135 lbs thin limbs 38-26-38). i ordered this dress in a size 4 regular and i find the length perfect with flats or with heels. i also find the bust area, waist and hips accommodating without being tight, which usually never happens. for this current sale price, this is a gorgeous dress made with beautiful material.",1
"The print and style we're great! unfortunately, my bust unbuttons the top. there's no way i can wear this, even if i sized up.",0
Love this sweater. i wore it to work with leggings and a long sleeved shirt underneath. it lays nicely.,1
"This dress is so beautiful it makes me feel like a goddess, lol. i'm normally a 10/12 or m/l and took a 12. i think the 10 would have worked too. everything from the colors, fit and flow of the dress is wonderful. i didn't have any problem with there being too much fabric as some of the reviews mentioned.",1
"This skirt is unique yet versatile and gorgeous. everything about this skirt works: dazzle balanced out with softness and midi length. the twirly width shows off the skirt in a subtle way, and super comfortable. no petite 2 left so i purchased a regular 2 and it fits perfectly (i am 5ft2in, 26 waist, 36 hips), the hem falls about 2in. longer than shown on the model. this skirt is sold out fast, no surprise. it flatters all body types at all ages. get ready for lots of compliments!",1
Very cute top but it is wide and runs large. it is very flattering with skinny jeans and the color is a beautiful navy almost a hint of purple. i would consider a size down. may run on the short side for those with longer torsos.,1
This sweater/jacket is great over any blouses. love the color. it looks more slightly peachy cream color that i love! goes with everything. warm. i thought it ran true to size. i ordered a small and love the way it fits. if you are looking for more of an oversized piece then you would need to size up.,1
Love this top. fits me perfect. i am bigger on top and received many compliments in this shirt.,1
"Super cute, well made, great embroidery. waist runs big.",1
"This style is right up my alley and i was excited to receive it. however, it is seriously overpriced. i ordered the white and the material is thin and see-through. the small was even a bit roomy (5'7"", 140lbs, 32dd). going back unfortunately.",0
"This top looked so cute in the picture, but unfortunately doesn't live up to it! the one i received, actually has the print shown in the photo on the inside of the shirt. it makes it much darker, and boring. the shirt itself is on the short side, and would've looked better if it hit lower on the hips, there's just too much fabric for it to land higher than that.",0
"Love this dress! the light fabric quality, color, and design all added to the grecian goddess feeling! my usual 0 fit perfectly, giving me a great shape and the length is great!",1
"This dress has rich color, excellent quality fabric and wonderful style. you can wear it now for fall with boots and jean jacket or in the summer for a great sun dress.",1
Cup size is really small for a medium. no way to adjust the back strap. ended up giving it to my daughter. cute but so poorly executed.,0
"I'd say these are exactly as-pictured and i'm happy with them. they run a little big in the waist; i most often wear xspetite in retailer sizes, and can often wear xs regular but these are a bit loose (i have a 26"" waist, 34"" hips). the drawstring tie solves that of course but it's only in the front, it doesn't go all the way around the waist, the rest is elastic. i'd also say these are high-rise, or long in the crotch (but i'm only 5'3"" so they're probably mid-rise on tall people). i have them hi",1
Love this top!! fits perfectly & it's lovely,1
"I purchased these leggings to match the top pictured with the outfit. i love the top, and i wanted to love the leggings since the combination of the top with the leggings has fantastic style. alas, the straps around the ankle got bunched because my legs are just not long enough. even though these are very comfortable leggings, i will be returning the leggings due to the length issue.",1
"As much as i loved the fabric and lace on this top, the cut of this blouse was not flattering for my body shape. also i thought it was shorter than it looked online. i had to return this piece.",0
This sweater i bought to go with a navy dress. it is not ivory. it is sortof a blush color???? not at all what i had in mind. the sweater itself is pretty. the back is shorter as someone else described which looks slightly awkward when wearing it. definite return. :(,0
"This tee is cute and unusual and i am sure i will wear it pretty often. i do wish i had ordered a size smaller than my normal large, but i am waiting for it to shrink in the wash a bit. the material is thin and it certainly doesn't feel like it is worth the price tag. i got it on sale and still think it is only worth about 20$.",1
"This didn't work for me. it looks better unzipped. the piece made me look extremely top heavy, and i am by no means overweight, but i do have a larger chest on a small frame (36c, 5 feet, 115). honestly, it just made me look fat. the design is cute, but this is going back..",0
"I'm 5'8, 130 and a small fits nice. these are different with the silky fabric, pattern and piping - busy but still classy. it is hard to match with a shirt as you need a shorter top so you don't lose too much of the pant's unique design.",1
"I love the colors. however, $200 is a lot to pay for a small piece of fabric , no lining what so ever. the fabric is very thin. you will need a slip. looks just like a cover-up. going back.",0
"Skirt was too big in the wiast and too much fabric. was not flattering, and generally not cute enough to warrent spending 50$ to get it tailored. usual size, oop felt atleast 2 sizes too large. the pattern on the skirt, and the nuetral color is very nice. if you can find one that fits, would be a nice 3 season skirt!",0
"I was in trouble when i saw this dress in the new arrivals section this month! it's one of those dresses i had to have for the holidays. i didn't want to risk it not fitting so i ordered my usual size 6 and also a size up, 8. (5'6"", 135lbs, size 6) well the 6 was entirely to tight, i couldn't even zip past my rib cage. the 8 went on, but it was very body con looking! hugged every curve! this might be the look some might be going for, but not me!! i'm so disappointed that i can't have the dress f",1
"This dress is everything i hoped it would be--bright, colorful, quality jacquard, classic silhouette. unfortunately it runs small up top on the bust and i couldn't even zip it up all the way. returning :(",0
"I was planning to order it online but someone returned it to my local store and i tried it on.............. my regular size is 6. i have another byron lars dress size 6 that fits me like a glove. this dress fits beautifully from the waist down. the top part is very loose and at least a size too big. very disappointing. i am not sure if it is just me or this particular dress, but it was not flattering. :(",0
"I was very shocked to receive this dress with a rusty zipper, looks like crusty white rust . see attached pictures. the dress fabric is very nice and i did try it on and it is a very nice fit, lined with a little stretch but my gosh what a cheap poor quality zipper that looks like it was old and exposed to moisture because the metal parts have a white crusty substance! retailer you really need to check your merchandise before sending to your loyal customers. lately the quality has been declining a",0
I got the white with black print and it is nice material and a pretty dress. i just would have preferred a better cut but overall pretty work dress .,1
"I really like this dress. buying it during retailer weekend helps me to like it more. the fabric is lovely. i like the popover styling. its slightly boxy, but not oversized. the sleeves do puff a little bit and i wish they didn't, but that's not a deal breaker. the shoulders are cut a little small, so it can be a challenge to take off. i usually wear a medium or an 8 in most retailer brands. i ordered this in a medium and it fit true to size.",1
"I'm a big fan of the ""idea of"" jumpsuits and rompers, but so often they go wrong. this one was an unexpected surprise. i'm 5'10"", size 8-10/medium, and the medium fit well and was actually super flattering. the waist is cinched just so that it's very slimming. the roll tab cuff is a cute touch and is probably 2"" higher on me than the model, but adorable none the less. great quality too. love!",1
"There isn't a whole lot that i did like about this dress. the shoulders have large poufs, the fabric isn't very soft, and it's not flattering. maybe with a belt i could be tempted, but i wasn't too fond of the dress.",0
I was returning an in line order from same designer and saw this dress. i love it. much prettier in person. this will get well worn by me!,1
"This is the third jumpsuit i've ordered and written a review for this season. this jumpsuit is the best by far. i bought it in my usual size small (32d--31-38) and it fit me, even though i'm tall (5' 8.5""). i would say it looks much the same as it does on the model, maybe an inch shorter in the legs on me. love that the legs are rolled up by a tab and a snap--no uncomfortable elasticized legs. i am more legs than long torso (i usually wear a 33"" inseam with flats). the jumpsuit is very easy to g",1
"I'm so disappointed this dress didn't work out! i ordered the size medium, post baby i'm a solid dress size 6 or 8 depending on the designer.
the cashier was laughing with me how ridiculously huge this garment was when i held it up. 

also the length was super long, description says 35"" which would be mid thigh for me, but this thing hit me mid knee. also, like the previous review the shoulders are tented and poofy. so bizarre and the cut reminds me of a maternity dress, but the shoulders def",0
"Gorgeous dress, but so low in front and in back...i couldn't figure out how to pull it off without a cardigan/sweater. beautiful fabric and color.",0
"I've never worn a romper before but decided to give this one a try because i'm loving the colors/pattern. i'm so glad i did! it's even cuter on and very flattering! my only complaint is the buttons. i wish it was easier to remove and put on especially since this is a romper afterall. still, this is a beautiful piece!",1
"I know rompers typically aren&amp;#39;t the easiest and while i loved this fabric this was a pain to put on no zipper, etc. and the buttons are tiny and since the fabric doesnt stretch it is difficult to even try on. the length of the shorts was great and the fit was just ok all in all i don&amp;#39;t think it is worth the price.",0
"This was exactly what i was looking for: a spring dress i could wear while it was still cool out. loved the colors, pattern, and the fact that it could hide a belly bulge. but i got it in a petite small, and i was swimming in it. i got it in an xs, and the body of it was just right, but the bust was so tight i nearly ripped it trying to climb out (and i'm a barely an a cup). i don't normally have this problem with dresses, but in this case the top and bottom half of the dress felt like they were",0
Like the other reviewer said it&#39;s hard to get on and i had to size down like i often do at retailer. but it&#39;s so pretty and it&#39;s not too short like most rompers. we host thanksgiving every year and i&#39;m so excited to find an alternative to a dress/pants so i can work &amp; cook in style.,1
"The fabric is a nice weight jersey. i prefer to wear the dress backwards as the back of the dress has a moderate v and the round neck (which is actually the front of the dress) makes for a very flattering back. the skirt part of the dress is full but the jersey fabric falls in such a way that does not cause the silhouette to look ""hippy"". this is not a dress that fits close to the body through the torso, so if you're looking for that you might consider going down a size.",1
"This dress felt small in torso and waist and suffocating in sleeves ( i do have average athletic arms). but the shoulders were cut so wide that one side was falling off, as i fix, one shoulder, another will slide down.
the material is nice but since it is not lined, it feels inexpensive, disposable.",0
"I have several pairs of coh and love them all. when i saw these go on sale in my size i quickly purchased them. however, when i tried them on at home and looked in the mirror, i was pretty shocked that the back pockets were extremely long. meaning, they go well below your butt cheeks (like 3""# which means they look like they are sitting too low on your body-and they aren't they are actually i little higher waisted than most coh! 

i thought perhaps it was my perception that day, so i waited an",0
"I was very excited when this dress arrived in the mail. the fabric is so comfortable, but the print was overwhelming. it is also very tight on the top and i got lost in the fabric at the bottom. i had to return it.",0
"I was so so excited to get this sweater in the mail. unfortunately, the sweater is lined with the same material (very soft and warm btw) as the polka dots, which sheds like crazy. i wore a white tshirt under this for the first time, and my shirt was covered in black fuzz by the end of the day. so much so that i was gathering balls of it to be thrown away. very disappointed. a lint roller can't even clean up the tshirt.

in terms of sizing, this fits tts, i normally wear a l or xl, got this in an",0
"Well made dress, but too much fabric for my taste. it lays a little heavy on the body & does not give a slimming affect. the colors are vibrant & pretty, but the dress is too long, as well. as other reviewers have said, the front is too low cut, but turn it around and it looks & feels better. didn't work for me, sadly, i'll be returning it.",0
"I adored this suit - the style, the colors, the thick quality of the fabric...but unfortunately the bottom seams cut into my groin and backside so much, it was practically painful! i'm 5'7', 128 lbs, and usually wear a size small, but was advised to size up. even with the medium i tried on, everything fit well but the length, though i've never thought i had a long torso. sizing up to a large would make the bust way to large for my small b chest. was so sad to return this suit!",0
I am five four and one hundred and twenty pounds and the small fits me perfectly with enough room in the arms and chest. i am a 34c. the red is gorgeous and sweet. got it on line sale and worth it,1
"I love the overall look and feel of the dress. my only complaint is that it was shorter and lower cut in person than it looked on the model and i'm not tall. i ordered a small and i'm 5""4 130 lbs bottom heavy. the skirt is perfectly flowy and hides my problem areas really well; however, i will need to wear a camisole with it to hide cleavage that will show otherwise.",1
"Nice, easy to wear dress!",1
"I love simple pull-on jersey dresses and so i had to try this one. unfortunately, it did not work out. fit is tts, i liked the fabric which is soft, silky yet with some weight to it, and i appreciated the thoughtful construction with multiple well placed darts in the chest. the skirt is lovely, swingy but not too full, hangs well. what stopped me from purchasing it is the fit in the shoulders, it was too broad for me and gave the dress an overall awkward shape. the neckline was also a little too",0
"I purchased this dress in the raspberry for my best friend's bridal shower and it was such a hit! i got it for the $60 sale price with the additional 40% off sale items that retailer loves so much- it came to $41! i paired it with a chunky gold necklace and it was adorable! so many compliments! i'm typically a medium through and through and this fit me true to size as well. 5'6"", between 135-140lbs. the cut of the dress fit me perfectly and the material is amazing. i'd definitely purchase this!",1
"The dress is too big. i got size 4, after checking the measurements chart (for reference: 5'7"", 125 lb). it is too wide, not as fitted as in the picture. the cut is too deep (might work better for a bustier lady, but looks pathetic on me). 

the pattern is too bright, much brighter that in the picture (i got red pattern). it's not that the photos represent the colors inaccurately, it's just... the colors are much more vibrant in real life.

the material is heavier than i expected.",0
"I agree with the other reviews - it's a little small in the arms, low cut in the chest, but really broad in the shoulders. i bought the xsp, which is a size up from my normal xxsp. they didn't have xxsp to compare. and i am a small person with big athletic shoulders, and my usual problem is with things being tight in the shoulders and fit everywhere else. overall, an excellent buy at the sale price. size up for more room in the chest and arms.",1
"Great dress. the seaming helps add shape to the dress. it is flattering and super comfortable. this dress is so easy to wear, i'm sure i will reach for it again and again.",1
"I am going to keep it. i think it will be a great ""throw on and go"" piece you can wear with many different types of shoe/sandal. the detail on top is excellent and it is a flattering cut. two complaints: runs a little big on bottom, a little ""genie"" looking...like there is too much fabric above the elastic around your upper ankles. but the bigger issue is that there is no zipper or elastic on top so slipping the top over your shoulders is super tight, to the point i thought i was going to rip it",1
"I was attracted to the feminine design of the dress, the silhouette, the flouncy skirt; however, i ordered the red motif pattern and hated the splotchy, dark colors.",0
"I tried this in my normal sp. i found it to run a little snug, but the neckline was way too low for every-day wear.",0
"I love this sweater dress. i got the ivory color in a size small. i'm a size 6 & 5'5"". i feel in love with it while shopping with a friend, who kind of rolled her eyes at it. i went back later because i knew i loved it. since the ones on the sale rack were covered with dust and dirt at the hem. i ordered it on line in m & small and the small fit better. it is so soft, and the color is great.",1
"I loved how this looked on the model, however, once i tried on in store, i was greatly disappointed. i usually wear a meduim and the small and extra-small were huge on me. there was so much extra material that i was swimming in this. i had such high hopes for this. there were no petite sizes to try on in the store but i am not sure it would have helped.",0
A good sweater but something about it was just not right for me. just didn't feel like i would wear it.,1
"This dress has been one that i just adored online and in the store so i was happy when i bought it on sale. i have worn this dress one time, thinking that i would love it. the problem is that as i wore it, the dress continued to stretch out of shape and just did nothing for my curvy bottom half. the dress just looked pulled and stretched out of shape. i would say that it may be the yarn and that it has too much give or at least more give than i want.",0
"The colors and design are stunning in person. it is one-size and as most kimonos go it is billowy and flowing, and not fitted. i plan to wear it with a pair of black shorts and also with black leggings. i love the idea of layering this over shorts. i have a similar kimono and wear it as a bating suit cover-up. the long kimono over short looks fresh and modern and gives you the option to have some coverage when you want it. also, really pops over simple black leggings and black top. it's light an",1
"I was so excited to try this dress, but after ready the reviews,i though they were all over the place! i descided to order my typical retailer size small. i'm 5'6"" , 134 lbs, and wear a size 6. well, it was a snug fit! i have a slim build and this was just to snug for my taste. i imagine a medium would have been better. however, i was very surprised by the length and slit... the dress hit at my knee cap with the slit going all the way up to mid thigh... .!?? i've seen pics of this dress on instagr",1
"I was so excited for this kimono. i thought the colors would be lovely. i was looking for a unique wrap/vest/kimono. i ordered this online expecting to be dazzled. sadly, i was not. this arrived and fell short on all measures. the colors were flat, the fabric felt cheap and the construction did not scream $108. it felt like something i would find in a college import/head shop. back it went. i ended up buying the silves wrap, which i love.",0
"I am 5""7"" and weigh 123 lbs. i tried on both these dresses in medium, and they both fit. they are not too thin, not too high slit, not scratchy. the problem is i am middle aged with a thick waist. the waist looked lumpy with the close fit knit. if you are younger, slim and tall, you will love it. i sent it back with regrets. hope this helps.",1
This is a lovely little nightie. i am a size 8 and i bought the medium and it fits perfect. it's soft and lightweight and not as see thru as i thought it would be. very light and airy and the sale price was great!!!,1
"Based on the mixed reviews about fit, i waited to purchase until i could try it on in the store and was not disappointed. i'm wondering if there are different batches of this dress? i'm 5'7 and the dress fit as in the photo. the side slits come above my knees but not too high. arm holes are a bit large so if you want more coverage this may not be for you. the material is cozy and soft. the cream color is gorgeous. size wise, it definitely looks boxy and marshmallow-like if too loose. i am usuall",1
"I bought this online in my usual size (petite xxs) for in-store pickup. when i tried it on, the kindest word to describe it would be ""voluminous""--it was at least 2 sizes too big on me. i looked like i had taken grandma's tablecloth and constructed a homemade blouse. the blouse comes with an attached cami, which was also way too big for me. the color is not white (as described), but rather an ivory/cream color--definitely not the best shade for my light olive skin. i do think that it looks lovel",0
"I wanted to love this dress, however it has no shape to it. it is also somewhat see through, so something needs to be worn under it. i feel like i received a dress that has been stretched out and returned. i'm extremely disappointed. i do not recommend.",0
"The cream color in this dress is divine. such a stunning dress that can be worn with a vest, jacket or alone. it looks very luxe and expensive in the cream color. because it's a knit, can go smaller in size. i tried on both the x-small and small. opted to go with the x-small. found it fit better.",1
"Tried on my normal size in the store and i was swimming in it. the sales associate suggested i order the petite in store. perfect! i just wish there were more opportunities to try on petite sizes in store.
this coat is soft and roomy. when it's buttoned up it has a great shape too.",1
"This dress had so much potential but the horizontal knit ruined it. i tried on size xxs in grey since my usual petite xxs size was not available. the fabric was a good weight and dress was well constructed. however, the wide horizontal knit made the dress bulge out at places especially in the lower body thus made me look wide and bulky. i wish they had used a cable knit pattern which will make the dress drape much more nicely and more flattering.",0
"I bought this kimono only a couple weeks ago...and i think i've worn it six times already! this kimono is stunning. light, airy and the colors are absolutely gorgeous. the print is unique and bold. i've worn this over a black dress...with leggings and a white tank...with denim and every color top. the options are endless with this beauty! the only downside is the kimono is so airy and oversized that the armholes easily get hooked on things. i ripped it once but thankfully it was right down the s",1
"I thought this dress looked gorgeous on the model. so floaty and light. when it came, i found it to be the exact opposite. the hem is so heavy and laid on me like a potato sack. it had way too much material at the bottom and weighed me down unfortunately.",0
I love this coat. i would definitely recommend it. i normally wear a size 6 or a medium. i bought my normal size and had to return it for a small. customer service was great and made for an easy online exchange.,1
This coat is very nice. it's soft and the colors are great. the only reason i gave it a 4 stars and not 5 is that it runs huge! i normally wear a size small to medium in tops and i like a bit of moving room in my coats so i ordered a medium. when i put it on i just started laughing. it was so huge. i wanted to exchange it for an xs to see if that would have been small enough but it has already sold out in that size. i think this could be a big win for larger sizes but unfortunately for me it did,1
The quality and color is great on this top.  the neckline just seemed a be pulled a little too tight on the one side of my neck to be a true off-the -shoulder look.  and to wear it as a cowl neck (or actually looks like a boat neck) just makes it too ordinary- since i love the off the shoulder look.  it fit me everywhere else and the slim waistline of this top is super flattering- so i think my size was right.  the cut of the neckline just needed to be more more definitive one way or the other.,0
"I wanted to love this skirt it was good quality, but the front is a loose flap that is exposing so i had to return it",0
"I just bought this nice dress on sale as i love the dolan brand and purchased my regular size small (34/27/35) and it fits me perfect so i'd say it runs tts. the material is nice and soft, not see through at all and a good length (i'm 5'4""). i bought the regular and didn't seem to need a petite. it's a slimming dress that's not overly tight too. i also really like the mock neck and don't find it constricting at all as the material has a bit of stretch. the short sleeves will be nice when it's sp",1
"This was my favorite item in the august catalog & i knew i had to have it. my store had not received it yet so i ordered online. after reading the other reviews, i sized down and the fit is still much too large as this top has way too much material. this is coming from someone who loves swing tees and can appreciate a loose fit. however, this top hangs like a tent. also, the elastic around the bottom of the sleeves is quite uncomfortable. i do think the top is pretty and recommend only if you ar",1
"Pants are overpriced and very uncomfortable. to my utter dismay i wore them during a business trip for the first time and ended up with bruises caused by the side zipper. i have been a long time retailer shopper and usually my go to store, however,ending up with a pair of pants that caused me pain was a very big disappointment,",0
"So, i bought these pants in mid-september while at a local retailer store - i thought they were a bit short but the salesgirl assured me they were fine. wore them soon after and then discovered they came in tall sizes as well. anyway, one they came on sale i rebought them nabbing the last tall in my size. while that is a testament for how much i love them - the fit is true to size other than the length issue. i am 5'10"" with long legs - the 28t fit me perfectly. of course they cost me more than th",1
So small! i was a solid size 12 in skirts but recently lost some weight. i was still nervous to buy a size 10 so i bought the 12 thinking i can always take it in if i have to. the 12 - which should have been big on me was tiny. this skirt is built for someone with non-existent hips. returning.,0
This is my second pair of pilcro chinos. their pants and shorts are so soft--even those who love to run around pantless might relent. this brand tends to run a bit large so if you like your pants form fitting you may want to size down.,1

"I'm 5'7"" 155lbs and ordered a large. it fit, but the arms were awkwardly short. the finish details on the end of each sleeve almost would have to be pushed back to the elbow for it to look right, which would be okay. however, the interior seam of the neckline is cut jaggedly and isn't even finished with any stitching. it's just tucked haphazardly inside the neckline and isn't sewn--it would unravel with washing. 

it's soft and snuggly and cute if you get it on super-sale and don't mind it com",0
Love this top! off the shoulder fits great! little extra room around the torso than i'd love... but still absolutely in love with this top! the black lace detail on the bottom is amazing! love the colors for fall! ordered a small and i'm 5'9 138lbs and i ordered a small,1
"Other reviewers have pointed out that these tops (i have both colors now, spoilers!) run long- and i am happy to agree. basically, there's a lot to work with here. i'm always looking for longer tops to traverse a larger bust, and this is a great hip-hitting length for me. plus, the neckline can be style multiple ways. all in all, a flattering better-than-basic sweater.",1
These jeans are excellent! i've been looking for a boyfriend jean that has plenty of room without just looking too big and these are it. there's lots of give in the material but they still conform to your shape. i highly recommend!,1
"Purchased the navy/green and the red/brown. ultimately exchanged the red for the black/gold. the charlies tend to run small, so size up one. i normally wear a 26/2, but needed a 4 in these. the side zip makes for a slimming fit. i'm 5'3 and it is an ankle fit. i've paired a sleeveless silk navy blouse with the blue pant when the weather was warm and now i pair with a white oxford and navy cable knit sweater. i see many more possibilities for both pairs. fun print and fabric that can work through",1
"This top is very gorgeous and chic. it is very tight at the bottom, but i feel like it will stretch a little over time, it is also very long which i love, because it can be rouched up to a great length if you are curvy. both colors are great, i bought both and love both. the sizing was correct, if you want it to fit like it does on the model shot. if you want it a little more fitted, size down, but it may be very tight on the bottom. all in all i love them and they are definitely a great find fo",1

"I am so bummed. these jeans are the perfect weight, totally distressed (and torn) in a way that looks like you've owned them for years, they flare out at the bottom of the legs just the right amount...but there is one huge - or i should write small - problem: your thighs have to be incredibly small to get these pulled all the way on.

I wanted to love this sweater but the fit is off slightly. i ordered my regular size xs and the chest/shoulder area fits nice but the waist comes very tight and not flattering to wear unless style similar to the model with a tucked in look. nice color and decent quality fabric but not my favorite fit. going back to the store.,0
"It does run large as most reviewers noted. i opted for the pxs and it was still very large and the way that the elastic at the top hit me it bunched funny and made my chest look huge and i'm only a b cup. it added a good two cup sizes to my chest and it just looked odd. the length of the petite was good for me at only 5'4"" so the length did not overwhelm but the width was still really too wide. love the fabric and the lace at the hemline. it just wasn't for me but for those it works for it is be",1
The jeans are soft and comfortable.  they are the perfect staple in my closet.  more colors please!,1
"I found this skirt on the sale rack and apparently miss marked and i did not try it on. when i got home i tried it on to find it has this open flap in the front with a very short slip. the color is a dark navy. i love the brand because they claim on the label to be made in the usa, which is something i prefer. i am still on the fence about this skirt thinking maybe i would bring it to the tailor to see if the panel can be stitched to the faux leather material half way down to eliminate this full",0
"This dress is only suitable for a beach cover-up: it is completely sheer. expensive, even on sale, for something with such a limited wearability. i returned it.",0
"Adorable skirt but fit is definitely too tight like the other reviews before me 
 i am super petite 4 11 105 pounds the double zero and zero were just a little tight for me and a little too long ( both could fit around my waist which is a 24 but high waisted and tight not a fit around the hips)
 if  the length had been above the knee i might have kept  the zero but they were both returned 
 great skirt in the theory  with the wrong  waste fit and length",1
This looks great on the model and is probably beat suited for someone that is tall and thin with small hips.,0
"I wasn't sure how this top would look on me but i just love it! i am 5'3"", 115 lbs and i ordered the petite small. i may even been able to get away with petite xs. i did not find this top too full, long or tentlike at all. i have a bust as well and it looks very flattering on me. i wore it with denim shorts and it will look great with skinny jeans. i would also wear it on the beach as a cover up. very versatile. i love the color and pattern on the top and really love the black lace on the bottom",1
"I was excited to receive this top because i love the design, but was very disappointed when it arrived. i thought the embroidery would be striking but it's not. the material is a t-shirt knit which also added to the disappointment. it was not flattering at all.",0
"For the last few seasons,bordeaux releases this top in different materials and a slight variation, but same off-the-shoulder theme (the winter merino wool version was always sold out as soon as it hit the store). this is my third top in this version. it is very flattering but it must be styled right, which an retailer stylist taught me. it must be turned to the side a bit in order to fit correctly (but not necessarily have to be pulled off-the-shoulder). the bottom hem has to be placed at the uppe",1
"I saw this on a girl at the winery where i work and i thought to myself - i have to have that top! it is perfect for the fall season. the pattern/print is very intricate and lovely. i think it fits true to size - the petite xxs is just right. the sleeves do not come to the wrist, but the photo here depicts that already. the elastic in the arms feel a little tight, but that would be my own negative comment. the fabric is beautiful and flows just right - it does not feel to big to me at all. i'm s",1
I got this in the blue and love it. tts and the shape is very unique and classy- better than shown on the model. it can be worn alone or with a long sleeve underneath as a layer. considering the neutral as well.,1
"I love this top, it is a cool style mix between mensware and women's. the collar is gorgeous, making it feminine and beautiful. i normally wear a size large in retailer, i would size down. returning my large for a medium. a beautiful shirt for many occasions.",1
"So much odd stuff going on here with the cut/fit. the top is sort of tight in the bust, even with a small chest. the sleeves are dolman-style and are billowy at the top, but then tight on even my skinny arms. the slip plus the dress itself took me a good 5 minutes to figure out how to put on...just too much effort. it is otherwise a beautiful pattern, color, and length. just a miss for me personally in the fit department. bummer!",0
"With all the white dresses to choose from this year, this was the one i settled on. it is comfortable, the quality is good, especially in the edge detail, it's machine washable (which is a must for me and white), and it is easy to dress up or down. i am 5'7"", 125lbs and found my usual size small to fit tts - it is loose fit like the model shot. easy throw on and go dress with cute details to boot :)",1
"I i hesitate to say that i don't recommend this dress,it really is so pretty,but a different fabric might have worked better. more importantly,the cut is not right,for me anyway. the neckline is a little high and the dress starts to flare out from the lower end of your boobs and continues all the way down giving a very wide lower half,way too much fabric at the bottom....looks like a triangle . if they' done a scoop neck and a shift style it would have been perfection",0
"Soft and feminine, pretty pastel colors, very romantic. the fit is flattering and feminine, the fabric is light, the lining is soft. color is pale and i may need a little brighter colors, but i might let that pass... i am on the fence only based on color, otherwise, gorgeous dress. the 0 fit me well, but the back touched the ground, so i would probably order petite (front is higher, so no issue there). 

30 dd, 26.5 in waist, 115 lbs for reference with 0",1
"I've been looking for a nice summer maxi dress and after reading some positive reviews, i decided to get the dress. the fabric is soft and has a nice flow to it. however, i had to return the dress because the cuff of the sleeve was too tight on my forearm, which make it impossible for me to raise my arms.

i ordered size petite xxs",0
"I was a little wary of this top but decided to try anyway. so glad i did. the style is great and the fabric is lightweight and comfy. i debated between the blue and the honey and ended up with the honey. it is just so different yet such a nice neutral. i am normally a size 10 (or maybe a large 8) in tops and purchased this in size 6. it definitely runs large. for reference i am 5'6"", 145 lbs, 34dd. not sure why another reviewer said this top isn't for large busts. it was very flattering on me an",1
"This shirt is a great deal on sale,i would not pay full price.i got it in the honey color and it is really cute. this shirt does run very large. i normally wear a small or size 4 to 6 and i was lost in a size 6. i went with a size 2 and it was perfect for sizing purposes i am a 34c and 5'3"" 112lbs..shirt is a bit lightweight so it is nice for summer or year round.",1
"I loved the print and fabric of this dress when i first saw it, but trying it on was a very different story! the photo seems to show a wider, more well-defined waist, with just a small amount of ""blousing"" on top, but this was not the case. yes, the waist fit, but it is a narrow band that was covered completely by the hanging over of the ill-fitting top, turning the entire look into a shapeless and very unattractive fit. sadly, this is going right back!",0
I saw this top in store and immediately picked up the red one. i am usually a 6 in tops sometimes an 8 but ended up with a 4.  feels a little snug in the armpit area but doesn't look it. i ended up getting the honey color one which looks great with white and army green pants. i loved the red one but felt like i was wearing a picnic blanket. it is a little flimsy and probably won't last that long so if you want to wait for it to go on sale and hope they have your size i would do that.,1
"I bought this top in the brown /white combo although i really wanted the red /white but haven't had any luck finding it. i am never sure of my size in retailer but run anywhere from small to large depending on brands. i'm 5'4"", 140, 34 ddd. i wish other reviewers would state their sizes to help others purchase.. i got this shirt in size 8 which usually never happens to me. i wear a white tank or cream cami underneath since it is very sheer and dips low at the cleavage area. it is still flowy but n",1
"The fabric and color is stunning. very well made. i'm 5'8"" and this romper works fine. it is long enough in the body. true to size. love it!",1
"The dress is not like pictured. it is above the knee and sleeves are neither 3/4 nor full length-somewhere in between. i am 5'4, 112 lbs, bought xs regular. had higher expectations for the price. going back to the store.",0
"I bought the xs and the fit was good. i'll probably add a snap at the bust area because the slip underneath does show like a camisole, which is fine, but i prefer it closed. also i'll add a belt to cinch my waist, booties and maybe a hat.",1
I tried this dress on on a whim and will definitely be getting it! the fit was perfect as it is not to structured so its really a more relaxed piece even though it doesnt look it... but the way you feel when you wear it is just magical!! i love this dress!!!,1
"Everything about this dress is beautiful except for the hemline. the color is beautiful; the old-fashioned, wispy femininity is beautiful. the dress probably could use something better at the waistline besides elastic, maybe ribbons to tie, but the hemline is what kills it. it is half a normal-length dress (in the front) and half maxi dress (in the back). the designer should have chosen one or the other, not both, and it would have been much better. for the category of aesthetic/design, i would",0
"I absolutely loved this once i got it out of the package. it's a very vibrant print in the red print, almost a picnic vibe, and the material feels soft and high quality. it runs very large though, i usually take an 8 or maybe a 6, and am busty, and in this i am pretty sure i will need the 4. i almost convinced myself i had lost weight when i tried it on! but i will return the 8 and get the 4 in the red, as well as probably at least one of the other colors as i like it so much.",1
This top is cute. i purchased a 2 instead of my usual size 4 and it fits well. i only recommend buying this top on sale. it is not good quality! there are loose threads hanging out of the seams all over the place and it is see through. it is totally nuts that it costs $88.,1
"This is the perfect dress! for it being a long maxi, it's surprisingly lightweight. the built in slip it covers everywhere you need it to without detracting from the overall look of the dress. i absolutely love it and wish it came in other colors/patterns.",1
"I so wanted to love this top. i ordered the ""blue"", which is blue and orange. i thought the orange would be brighter, it is not. it is a dull color. also, i'm usually a medium, this top fits fine on my shoulders/bust 34c, but it was huge around the waist, making me look a lot larger. if this top were a bit smaller around the waist, i would keep it, but it is going back.",0
"Unfortunately, this dress did not work for me like the other reviews. i am 5'8, 130lbs, and the dress looked like a tent on me (size s). there was just way too much material at the bottom. also, while the dress is lined, both layers are quite thin- not see through, but i would not call them substantial either. for the cost of the dress and the material, it wasn't worth paying more to have it tailored to fit better.",0
"The model looks awesome in this cute top, but on me it looked boxy but was too tight around the chest and was too short (for reference, i'm 5'7,"" 140 lbs., and 34c). the front is non-stretchy eyelet lace cotton fabric, yet the back is stretchy. in theory, it's pretty, but in reality it doesn't work - at least for me. i think it might work for someone petite with a smaller chest.",0
This top is very light weight and comfortable. i am normally a 8/10 in tops due to my bust size but ordered a 6 based on other reviews. it fits great. i really like the fit and the pattern. it has been a great summer shirt and i can see myself grabbing for it in the fall paired with skinny jeans and a cute bootie.,1
"I originally purchased this dress in a petite 6. i am 5'3"", 125lbs with a 36"" bust. the petite 6 was a bit too tight so i returned it and went up to a size 8. so happy i did! this dress drapes and flows beautifully and i find it immensely flattering to my hourglass figure. i also adore the floral print! one reviewer objected to the way the bodice drapes and the very small hook closure which seemed insufficient. i did not object to this characteristic. it fit me beautifully throughout the bodice/",1
"I'm petite, and i knew buying this that it would be a big sweater - that is the look that is portrayed on the model. the sweater is scratchy, the neck was so big and bulky i had trouble making it lay right. it looks great on the model here, but not on me. going back. so bummed. the color gray is true to what is shown and it has little ""holes"" or openings across the shoulders. so there is a tiny bit of detail. overall, not a great sweater.",0
"I was very excited to find a fun and lightweight white dress for spring/summer. for the past two years i have found two of my favorite white dresses. the material that this dress is made out of did not look high quality at all. the fit looked more like that of an old nightgown. this dress has no shape to it, although probably comfortable, not flattering. i had high hopes for this dress and wish that it looked like it does in the picture, in person.",0
"This dress is very flattering, comfortable and made me feel pretty!",1
"This skirt runs small because of the stitching around the hips. the waist fit fine but the hips were very snug, and i'm relatively slim in the hips.",0
"I bought this sweater because i love twinkle's knitting patterns and yarns. this sweater doesn't disappoint. i love all of the great details like the detachable collar, the double buttons along the front and the back panel is in a seed stitch (which differs from the front and sleeve stitch). it's super warm and cozy but it's also very heavy. depending on the temp outside, i can wear this as a coat. but i think the sweater will stretch over time because it's so heavy.",1
The front and back materials differ. the back of the shirt is soft and thin. the front embroidery is stiff but i imagine it will soften after a wash. pretty shirt though.,1
"On the hanger, this looks like a great dress .. especially to wear to a hawaii wedding. on me, not quite. 

the bell shape of this dress made it appear that i was carrying extra weight in the middle ... and the shorter length accentuated my big calves. 

for reference, i tried a 00p and i'm 5'1"", 102#, and 34a.",1
Can i tell you this top is amazing?! get it quick before it sells out!!,1
"I wanted to love this top but found it to run small and was too sheer for my taste. it is a beautiful top though, but you will need a cami with it.",1
This skirt is so cute. this is a staple to have in your wardrobe. i wear it with boots and boot socks. but tights for cold winter days as well as flip flops in the summer. i got my true size of 4. its fits perfectly. i love the length with a peek of leg when you walk!,1
"This top is similar to other tiny tops that i have ordered in the past...beautiful embroidery, great neutral and metallic color pallet that goes with everything, and light weight. the top does run small, so i needed the large size to accommodate my 38in bust plus a thin cami (shirt is see through). the large fit similarly to the fit on the model.",1
Before i ordered this i noted the other reviews that said it was sheer but thought i would just wear a layer underneath. unfortunately it was one of the sheerest fabrics i've ever seen. would love it if it could have been a more substantial fabric. to me it wasn't worth the money even on sale.,0
"What drew me to this shirt was the beautiful silver and gold embroidery on the front. the shirt was folded at the store, which makes sense because if it were hung it up, fewer people would try it on. this shirt is sheer from the front and more sheer in the back. this is what bugs me about so many ""clothes"" that are made these days: they are so cheaply made, so thin with cloth, that you are forced to layer with a camisole or something else in order to wear it in public. i can't wear sheer clothes",0
Lots of seam and stitching details make this even cuter than the picture's initial impression. fabric drapes nicely. the sleeves are a little tight if wearing something long-sleeved underneath. overall very unique!,1
"I'm 5'6"" and it hits me at mid-thigh. the top (black/camel version) is sheer enough to need a cami. the waist is quite high. not flattering for me--the empire waist makes me look a bit pregnant--plus i don't want to deal with having to wear a cami.",0
"This dress is so cute in the photo and fit true to size, but the material is slinky and felt cheap. the stitching was also poor quality. i am so thankful that retailer will let us order a batch, try on and return in store...this went back.",0
"I feel like snagging a pair of these was the equivalent to standing in line for black friday, as they always seem to be out of stock. now i know why. these are soft, comfortable, and slimming. they're somewhere between the hold of control top pantyhose and spans--they don't fall and sag throughout the day and are nicely slimming without being pain-inducing.",1
"I tried on this dress in the store and was pleasantly surprised with the fit and the look. it looks way better in person than in the pictures. the picture really doesn't do it justice. i consider myself a ""slight"" hour glass figured girl and this dress at the top hit me just right so that the crosswrap looks like it was made for my body and the peephole/keyhole in the front (you can hardly see on the model photo) is visible. i'm so happy with this dress!!! i feel like i could wear it at work/chu",1
"Don't know why but i didn't have high expectations for this dress. turns out it's uber flattering! makes my waist look tiny, accentuated bust. perfect for those of us with straight figures looking for a little more curves. bottom half of dress has heavy silky linking. top half unlined and a bit thin. color is almost pearl -- very very light gray. i'm between xs/s (33b-26-36, 5'8"" 120lb) and went with a small. hits an inch above knees. sleeves slightly loose through upper arm which is always bett",1
"As per usual bordeaux is perfect with this cardigan. very soft, washes well. love it.",1
This tee is amazing. it's light weight and perfect for the summer heat. the detail of the cross and tie back is perfect to elevate the style. this is going to be a solid staple in my tee collection. i wish it came in other colors because i would buy them all.,1
I really wanted to like this dress and was encouraged by the positive reviews. the dress itself was very comfortable but was very unflattering. the top fabric hit my ribs funny and made me look really wide.,0
"I like the contrast of the skirt with the bodice, the length of the sleeves, adn the subtle cut out at the neck. the cut is very flattering, adn i am glad the daker color is at the top, hte bottome color would wash me out. i tried on the regular size nad i would not get a peitte in this as the size was the perfect length for me. petite would be too short for my liking. (regular hit just above the knee)",1
"I tried these on because the color is really pretty and fun, and who donse't want a pair of comfy/cute pants... but they looked awful on my muscular thighs... i don't think the cut will be falttering on 99% of the population. also, not as comfortable as they looked, the crotch seemed a little ""low"" on me, though the pants were in the correct size.",0
I wanted to love this jacket. so soft and great color. unfortunately it is just too light weight. it is almost like shirt fabric. nice heft to the fabric though. nice length - accept the sleeves were short on me. i am 5'10 and 135lbs. the small was the right size. i was looking for something slightly warmer to layer.,0
"I recently purchased this dress at my local retailer when it was 40 percent on sale. i was overwhelmed with how much i liked it. it's comfortable, elegant and very chic. 

i will make this my go-to dress from now on.",1
"I ordered this skirt hoping i could wear it to work as it looked tailored on the model. this skirt is made from a heavy material but flares out. it is a whole lot of skirt! i'm 5'2"" and short waisted it looked like i was getting swallowed up.  i love the colors and design but it just overwhelmed me. it would work on someone taller.",1
"I am 5' 2"" about 118 lbs. thought this fit really well. very comfortable material. i wish the skirt was a different color-feels a little bland.",1
"I purchased this for a very good price and i typically love maeve... should have been a win-win. the fabric is thin and slinky in the most unfortunate way. it made finding appropriate undergarments very difficult. i had to add a slip (that helped) and figured that since i'm losing weight, it would look better when i'm down a few more pounds. that being said, i didn't find it to be figure flattering. i have a tummy and there was at least one photo from the bridal shower i wore this to, where i lo",0
The pattern of this skirt is adorable and looks better in person but the fabric isnt the best. it feels like an elastic fabric and is way to volumous. overall not my favorite.,1
"I worry when i have an elastic waist, or something that resembles this, but the dress hangs like a dream.
no puffing out, no gathers that you can see.
it is not sheath, but not a line either, kind of in between, hits several inches above my knees, but perfect with some black tights for winter. i saw the note about grey, have to try it on agin in daylight, but i would say think black on the top, light camel color on the bottom
i am 5'8, typically wear a size 12, and it was true to size for me

Cute dress but not for me.  the waist is too high and the sleeves are tight.  maybe on a different body type this dress would be perfect.  i returned it.,1
"I'm so impressed with the beautiful color combinations and embroidery but disappointed in the rayon fabric used, especially at this price point.  the sleeveless sheer blue outer dress is a flowy swing silhouette that retains many wrinkles.  i have thick shoulders and upper arms, so the armholes cut into my armpits.  the silky rayon liner is a blush rose color with adjustable spaghetti straps.  the slip has no stretch and feels a bit tight on my chest.  i ordered size medium petite and my stats a",1
I was surprised at the positive reviews for this product. its terrible! it cuts you in a weird place to make you look wide. the skirt is also not like the picture. its darker and heavier. the material isnt great. i had to return.,0
"This fit well, but the top was very see through. this never would have worked for me. i'm glad i was able to try it on in the store and didn't order it online. with different fabric, it would have been great.",0
"This dress in a lovely platinum is feminine and fits perfectly, easy to wear and comfy, too! highly recommend!",1
